('Aaron', 'Glad to hear it.')
('Aaron', "Keep the guild out of our way, and we won't have<br/>any problems.")
('Aaron', 'Same goes for you guys.')
('Aaron', "Go dance in the Lu family's palm for a while, see the<br/>sights, and then get the hell outta my town.")

('Elaine', "Hello, pot. I'm kettle.")
('Feri', 'The way you broke up that fight was amazing!')
('Agnès', 'Sorry we ended up causing you trouble.')
('Elaine', "Don't worry, it's all part of the job.")
('Elaine', "As is making sure everyday people aren't dragged into<br/>dangerous situations.")
('Agnès', 'Oh...')
('Van', 'I hear ya, all right?')
('Van', "Anyway, since we're here, why don't we go grab<br/>a bite?")
('Van', "(This is the place. Better make sure we're ready before<br/>we head in.)")
('Agnès', "This is where they've been hiding?")
('Van', "Yeah. Almata's base on the front lines for<br/>fightin' Heiyue.")
('Van', "(But if so, why ain't I sensin' any people around here?<br/>Wait... There is somethin' faint.)")
('Feri', 'Ohh! Look at that!')
('Feri', 'The lock is broken.')
('Van', 'Looks like someone busted in, if you ask me.')
('Van', "Judgin' by how clean that cut is, they used a<br/>Gekka technique.")
('Agnès', "That's the school of martial arts Aaron practices...")
('Van', "Yup. Let's roll, gang.")
('Aaron', '...?!')
('Van', '...Of course it had to be you.')
('Van', "(Huh? What's Elaine doing here?)")
('Van', "(Oh, right. Probably on patrol 'cause of all this<br/>Almata business.)")
('Aaron', 'There any reason why you stopped?')
('Van', 'Shh! Quiet!')
('Aaron', 'Huh? Why?')
('Aaron', "Oh, it's that Beauty's Blade chick. Heh.<br/>Imagine calling yourself that. Couldn't be me.")
('Van', "Try saying that in front of her. Guarantee you'll have<br/>a sword at your throat.")
('Aaron', "She's that touchy about it?")
('Van', "Anyway, just shut up. I don't wanna get caught.")
('Aaron', 'Aww. You shy?')
('Van', "No, you idiot. It's just gonna be a pain in the ass if<br/>she spots us.")
('Van', "Do you really want the guild pokin' their head in<br/>your business?")
('Aaron', 'Point taken.')
('Van', "Oh, she's leaving.")
('Aaron', 'So, you two know each other or something?')
('Van', "Thanks to work, yeah. I try to avoid her most of the<br/>time, but I haven't been able to do that lately.")
('Aaron', 'Uh-huh...')
('Van', "All righty. Let's get back to the investigation.")
('Elaine', "I'm...surprised that you're already out and about.<br/>Shouldn't you be resting?")
('Aaron', "Nah, I got myself a quick fix. It'll come back to bite<br/>me later, but I'll deal.")
('Van', "So what's goin' on with you? Y'all wrap up<br/>your investigation?")
('Elaine', "For the most part. We didn't get much out of<br/>it, unfortunately.")
('Agnès', 'Umm... Are the gangsters...?')
('Elaine', "They didn't make it.")
('Elaine', "That's five more lives claimed by Almata...")
('Agnès', 'Oh...')
('Van', 'Like Giacomo, they chose to step into the darkness—<br/>and they got swallowed up by it.')
('Van', "That's just a natural consequence of followin'<br/>that path. No need for you two to feel responsible for<br/>what happened.")
('Agnès', 'Van...')
('Elaine', "I know. I can't afford to dwell on this subject any<br/>more than I already have.")
('Elaine', "There's something else that's been bothering<br/>me, though. The numbers just don't add up.")
('Van', 'Yeah, I noticed that, too.')
('Feri', 'What are you two talking about?')
('Agnès', 'They must be referring to the total number<br/>of gangsters.')
('Aaron', "No way last night's murder spree was done by only<br/>five random thugs.")
('Feri', '...!')
('Van', "The storehouse is pretty big. Think some of 'em<br/>might've been hiding in there?")
('Elaine', 'Doubtful. We searched the place from top to bottom.')
('Aaron', 'They must have another hideout, then.')
('Elaine', 'The guild and the police came to the same<br/>conclusion, but we have no idea where it might be.')
('Van', "We're in the same boat, then.")
('Van', "Almata's managed to fly under Heiyue's all-seeing<br/>radar, so we don't know jack.")
('Van', "It's almost like they vanished without a trace.")
('Elaine', "I don't even know if most of Almata was<br/>actually here. We've only seen those two executives<br/>so far.")
('Elaine', "If they really plan on going to war with Heiyue,<br/>they're going to need much more manpower than<br/>what they've shown.")
('Elaine', "A handful of part-time gangsters won't cut it.")
('Agnès', 'Regardless, their lack of activity is certainly a cause<br/>for concern.')
('Van', "If the 'war on Heiyue' thing is just<br/>smoke-and-mirrors bullshit, then it'd all make sense.")
('Elaine', 'Perhaps they intend to send them on wild goose<br/>chases, chip away at their will to fight, then come in<br/>for the kill.')
('Feri', "That sounds like something they'd do.")
('Elaine', "If my theory is correct, then I don't think Langport<br/>will see any more large-scale attacks from them.")
('Aaron', "Even if you're right, I still can't let things end<br/>like this.")
('Aaron', "Those murdering bastards crossed the goddamn<br/>line—and I'll make sure they pay for it.")
('Agnès', 'Aaron...')
('Elaine', "Well, we can't do anything until we get more leads.<br/>I'm going to reach out to my contacts and see if<br/>they've found anything.")
('Elaine', "I'm not going to tell you to stay out of this, but...try<br/>not to do anything crazy, okay?")
('Van', "Welp, guess we've hit a dead end.")
('Agnès', "Elaine seems like she's at a loss as well.")
('Van', "And she's no slouch when it comes to investigating.")
('Van', "So if even she's having trouble tracking them down...")
('Van', "...then I'd wager they're hiding in some place that<br/>outsiders like us wouldn't think of.")
('Aaron', "Guess it's all up to me, then.")
('Aaron', 'You can count on me to carry the team.')
('Van', "Good, 'cause this whole thing's riding on you now.")
(40351, "Here's the goods.")
(40352, 'Excellent work.')
(40352, 'The delivery person was switched out, yes?')
(40351, 'Yeah. They got a kid to do the exchange.')
(40351, "Doesn't look like Heiyue's noticed a thing. I think<br/>we're in the clear.")
('Van', "(So he's the guy who wanted the drugs.)")
('Agnès', "(He hasn't noticed us yet.)")
('Feri', "(I think they're alone, too. Should we charge in?)")
('Van', "(Yeah. Let's go!)")
(40401, 'Seize them.')
('Feri', '...?!')
(40351, "Damn it! How'd they find us out?!")
(40352, "You must've screwed up!")
(40352, 'Unhand me at once, you Heiyue scum!')
('Agnès', 'Heiyue?!')
('Feri', "Ugh. I didn't even realize they were behind us.")
('Van', 'Why do I feel like we were made into pawns?')
('Van', "Neil must've been the bait. I thought it was weird that<br/>he managed to give Heiyue the slip.")
('Van', "Well, either way, you're doin' us a solid here. Saves us<br/>the trouble of bringin' them in ourselves.")
(40401, "Heh. We're always happy to clean up the trash.")
(40401, 'Thank you for your assistance. We were lucky that he<br/>issued a request to you.')
(40403, "Now, then. We will ask that you hand Neil over<br/>to us. He's a material witness and a suspect.")
('Feri', 'B-But he got caught up in all of this by accident.')
('Agnès', "Neil had no knowledge of the drugs. He doesn't<br/>deserve to be punished for this.")
(40403, "That's for us to decide. Our job is to judge, yours is<br/>to comply.")
(40403, 'I will ask one more time. Will you hand Neil over<br/>to us?')
('Van', "(The whole point of this request was to save<br/>our client. Giving him over to Heiyue would be like<br/>throwin' him to the wolves.)")
('Van', '(The way I see it, we got two choices:)')
('Van', "(We try to persuade 'em...)")
('Van', '(...or we fight.)')
('Van', "(Okay. Let's try that.)")
('Van', "Sorry, but I don't think we have to comply.")
('Van', "Our view is that our client shouldn't be judged<br/>for this.")
(40403, 'We are at an impasse, then.')
('Van', 'Yeah. So how about we compromise?')
('Van', "We ask that you don't lay a hand on our client.")
(40403, "You're a fool if you think we'd agree to that.")
('Van', "Let me finish. In return, he'll be banned from<br/>Langport for a little while.")
('Van', "We'll let you decide how long the ban lasts.<br/>How's that sound?")
(40401, 'Who do these outsiders think they are...?')
(40401, "*sigh* Very well. We can't deny your proposal—but<br/>only because you're the Lu family's honored guests.")
('Feri', 'Wait, really?!')
(40401, 'Neil is barred from entering Langport for one year.')
(40401, 'Should he breach this agreement, we WILL pass<br/>judgment on him.')
('Van', 'Sounds good.')
('Agnès', 'Phew. What a relief.')
('Van', "I know you guys've got your own way of doin' things.")
('Van', 'But the same goes for us, too.')
('Van', "Saving Neil is our job, and we're not gonna<br/>compromise on that.")
(40403, 'How impertinent.')
('Van', "That puts us at a standstill, though, so I've got<br/>an idea. Let's settle this with a good<br/>old-fashioned brawl.")
('Van', "If we win, you'll have to keep your hands off<br/>our client. If you win, he's all yours.")
(40401, "I can agree to that. It's your funeral, though.")
(40401, "Let's change locations.")
(40401, "Okay, it's just us now. No need to worry about locals<br/>getting in our way.")
(40403, "Fair warning, spriggan: we aren't going to show you<br/>any mercy just because you have children with you.")
('Agnès', 'I thought as much.')
('Agnès', 'We have to win this, you guys!')
('Feri', 'Right. For Neil!')
('Van', "All right. Let's show 'em how it's done!")
(40401, "Ugh... They're...too strong.")
(40403, 'No wonder the Lu family and Master Cao place so<br/>much faith in you.')
('Van', 'Phew. That just about wraps things up.')
('Feri', "If there's one thing I've learned from this, it's that the<br/>Gekka style is terrifying!")
('Agnès', 'No kidding.')
(40401, "Well, you've bested us.")
(40401, "As per our agreement, we won't apprehend Neil.")
(40403, 'Tell him to be more careful when taking jobs that<br/>seem too good to be true.')
('Agnès', 'We will! Thank you very much!')
('Van', "Well, then. I think it's about time we go back and<br/>deliver the good news.")
('Feri', 'Thanks for sparring with us! It was a ton of fun!')
(61996, 'Did you seriously follow us all the way out here?!')
(61997, 'Bad move. You just signed your own death warrants!')
('Samson', 'P-Please, just let us go!')
('Samson', "We don't have any money. The mafia took every last<br/>mira we saved up.")
('Richie', 'Almata beat you guys to the punch there.')
('Aaron', "Well, lucky for you, we don't care about the money.")
('Aaron', "Fess up. You've been handing the people you beat to<br/>the mafia, right?")
('Aaron', 'Well?')
('Samson', 'W-We were just following orders.')
('Richie', 'Yeah! We had no choice. It was us or them!')
('Aaron', "I don't wanna hear your pathetic excuses!")
('Van', 'Save your breath.')
('Van', 'At this point, we should just give them over to the<br/>right people.')
('Van', "No point gettin' rough with them. They ain't<br/>worth it.")
('Aaron', "You can't be serious.")
('Aaron', "*sigh* Fine. I guess you're right.")
('Aaron', 'So, who are you handing them over to?')
('Van', 'Hmm...')
('Van', "If we wanna get justice for the people who've been<br/>hurt by 'em...")
('Van', '...then handing them over to the guild is the<br/>right call.')
('Aaron', 'You think so? I dunno. Those guys are way too soft.')
('Van', 'Look at it from this perspective.')
('Van', "The guild's got branches all over the continent, and<br/>its info network isn't anything to sneeze at.")
('Van', "If they tried to flee the country, the bracers would be<br/>on 'em in seconds flat.")
('Aaron', 'Fair point.')
('Aaron', "All right, then. Let's call up the guild.")
('Van', 'On it.')
('System', 'Van contacted the guild and gave Samson and Richie<br/>over to them.')
('Van', 'I think the cops are probably the best choice.')
('Aaron', 'You really think so?')
('Aaron', "I guess it'd be nice for them to be judged by the law.")
('Van', "Yeah, but that's not all.")
('Van', "Unlike the guild, the police aren't merciful.")
('Van', "Once they've done their time, the police have no<br/>obligation to protect 'em.")
('Van', "And that means Almata might swoop in and make<br/>'em disappear.")
('Aaron', "Oho. You've got a point there.")
('Aaron', "Damn, though. That's pretty coldhearted.")
('Aaron', "And here I thought you were just a big ol' softie.")
('Van', "You'll find that I'm a pretty complicated guy.")
('Van', "Anyway, I'm gonna go ahead and call up the cops.")
('System', 'Van contacted the police and gave Samson and<br/>Richie over to them.')
('Van', "Well, if we really want 'em to pay for what<br/>they've done...")
('Van', "...then Heiyue's our best option.")
('Aaron', "Yeah. They won't show them any mercy.")
('Aaron', 'Especially since Easterners were among their victims.')
('Aaron', 'The severity of the punishment might change<br/>depending on how many of them were caught up in<br/>their scheme.')
('Van', "Either way, they'll be punished a hell of a lot more<br/>harshly than if we gave them over to the guild or<br/>the cops.")
('Van', 'That good with you?')
('Aaron', "You aren't gonna hear any objections from me.")
('Aaron', 'Wanna go ahead and get in touch with them?')
('Van', 'Yeah. The Kowloon Hotel receptionist can help<br/>us there.')
('System', 'Van contacted Heiyue and gave Samson and Richie<br/>over to them.')
('System', 'Quest Pair of Jokers completed!')
('System', 'Earned')
('System', 'Received')
('System', 'There is no reason to enter this place.')
