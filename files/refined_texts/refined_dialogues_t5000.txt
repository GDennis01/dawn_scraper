('Attendant Wood', "I must say, I'm a little sad that the upper-class citizens<br/>scarcely board our trams these days.")
('Attendant Wood', 'I understand they are very busy—and are likely<br/>dazzled by the glitz and glamor of ETWS cars...')
('Attendant Wood', 'But even so, I feel that our orbal trams hold value as a<br/>tradition—and we have a duty to maintain them for<br/>our descendants.')
('Attendant Wood', "The orbal tram's late-night rides exist because, at one<br/>point in time, nobles used them to return home from<br/>high-society gatherings.")
('Attendant Wood', 'Most of them use limousines now, but the orbal tram<br/>was dearly appreciated in the early days of the<br/>Orbal Revolution.')
('Attendant Wood', 'During that time, our company replaced its carriages<br/>with its first line of trams. They were quite forward<br/>thinking in those days.')
('Attendant Wood', 'They realized that, with the normalization of<br/>automated vehicles, people desired a means of transit<br/>that was reflective of the times.')
('Attendant Wood', "The trams' relaxed pace affords passengers an<br/>opportunity to relish the sights of the city.")
('Attendant Wood', "They've now become an integral part of the<br/>city's aesthetics.")
('Attendant Wood', 'Welcome to Oración—the city where tradition<br/>always lingers. Our world-renowned trams happen to<br/>be one such tradition.')
('Attendant Wood', 'Did you know our company once ran a<br/>carriage service? You can learn all about its storied<br/>history if you decide to board.')
('Attendant Wood', 'Our trams are the pinnacle of elegance. They are a<br/>powerful means by which many experience the culture<br/>and history of our city.')
('Attendant Wood', "It's deeply unfortunate that the recent tragedy has cast<br/>a pall over the city, but I hope you can enjoy your<br/>time here nonetheless.")
('Officer Endeavor', 'The number of suspicious individuals has gone down<br/>this morning. Did they just up and leave?')
('Officer Endeavor', "If they did, then I can't help but wonder why they<br/>even came here in the first place.")
('Officer Endeavor', "We've received reports of activity from jaegers and<br/>bracers all around the city.")
('Officer Endeavor', "What's going on? And what on earth are the bracers<br/>up to?")
('Officer Endeavor', "I can't disobey orders from above, but that won't stop<br/>me from wondering why the top brass is<br/>playing dumb. Something is afoot.")
('Officer Endeavor', "No signs of suspicious individuals on the rail, and the<br/>station's clear, too.")
('Officer Endeavor', "Still, I can't be too lax. This city has many major<br/>political and business players—not to<br/>mention tourists.")
('Officer Endeavor', "It's my job to ensure their safety.")
('Officer Endeavor', 'The state of emergency has technically been lifted for<br/>Oración, but the police have been ordered to remain<br/>on alert.')
('Officer Endeavor', "Should we identify any suspicious individuals, we're<br/>to keep them marked, but we aren't allowed to<br/>confront them.")
('Officer Endeavor', "I don't know why the top brass has ordered this...<br/>Though I guess it's not my place to question them.")
('Cambridge', 'It sounds as though Monique will be heading off<br/>again soon. Time really does fly.')
('Cambridge', "The year's conclusion is upon us. I just wish it didn't<br/>have to end with such a horrible tragedy.")
('Cambridge', "I'm sure next year will bring more changes to<br/>our lives. It's sad to see the old way of life go, but I'd<br/>like to see what the future has in store.")
('Cambridge', 'Times sure are changing. My grandkid is living in a<br/>wholly different world from the one I grew up in.')
('Cambridge', 'When I started out as a railway engineer, we had<br/>steam engines, but in the blink of an eye, the age of<br/>orbal trains came upon us.')
('Cambridge', "The waves of the Orbal Revolution washed right over<br/>me back then...and now I'm feeling them all<br/>over again.")
('Cambridge', "Too many people take the boons of technological<br/>advancements for granted. I'm glad Monique<br/>knows better.")
('Cambridge', "They're tools that should be in human hands.<br/>They aren't something we place ourselves into the<br/>hands of—so to speak.")
('Cambridge', "I imagine that horrible incident was caused by<br/>a weapon. This is precisely why I don't want<br/>technology to dominate our future.")
('Cambridge', 'I was very worried when I heard Edith was placed<br/>under an extended state of emergency.')
('Cambridge', "However, talking with my grandkid has put me<br/>at ease. If something were to happen to her, I don't<br/>know what I'd do with myself.")
('Monique', 'So, Grandpa, take a look at these photos I took.<br/>These are the trains that run on the<br/>Tharbad-bound line. Check out that heat sink!')
('Monique', "And here's the Edith subway trains.<br/>Apparently, they're using new models these days.")
('Cambridge', "Goodness me. These trains don't look anything like<br/>the ones I saw back when I worked on the railroad.")
('Cambridge', 'I never knew you were so interested in this sort<br/>of thing. Taking after me, are you?')
('Monique', 'Yep. I took some photos of them on a whim and got<br/>curious about how they worked—and then the rabbit<br/>hole sorta swallowed me whole.')
('Cambridge', "Well, it's always good to explore new interests.<br/>Curiosity is the key to discovering the wonders of life.")
('Cambridge', "Now, since you're back home, why don't you pay your<br/>parents a visit?")
('Cambridge', "With the times being what they are, I'm sure they'll<br/>feel better knowing you're safe.")
('Monique', 'Fine... With everything that happened during my trip<br/>back, I bet Mom and Dad are worried sick about me.')
('Monique', "Let's meet up again soon. I wanna tell you everything<br/>I've learned about cameras!")
('Cambridge', 'Amazing... So this is what modern cameras can do.<br/>You can see all the nitty gritty details of this train<br/>with picture-perfect clarity.')
('Monique', 'I picked this camera up used at the orbal café<br/>in Edith. I asked Philibert to give it a once-over and<br/>to get the lens aligned.')
('Monique', "After he worked his magic, it was good as new.<br/>It's basically my travel partner at this point!")
('Cambridge', 'Ah. Now I understand why you felt so compelled to<br/>take a trip.')
('Cambridge', "Word of advice, though. While machines are fine<br/>tools for improving one's quality of life, it's best not to<br/>become dependent on them.")
('Cambridge', "If we ever lose access to them, it's good to know how<br/>to do things the old-fashioned way.")
('Monique', "Don't worry. I won't let it take over my life.<br/>Otherwise, I'll start taking new tech for granted, and I<br/>don't want that.")
('Monique', "My camera's not ready for pickup just yet. I came<br/>here thirty minutes early.")
('Monique', "I'm trusting that Philibert will get it back in<br/>peak condition. I wanna take tons of photos of<br/>the festival!")
('Monique', "I don't know if it'll be as fun this year, but I'm still<br/>pumped for it!")
('Monique', "Grandpa was a railway engineer, so it's no surprise<br/>he's passionate about machines. I love them, too, so<br/>we always have plenty to talk about.")
('Monique', 'I wonder if my obsession with tech was influenced<br/>by him.')
('Monique', "I'm really glad my grandpa is doing okay.")
('Monique', "I need to check on the rest of my family, too. I bet<br/>they're worried sick about me.")
('Monique', 'Wish I could talk to Grandpa about trains more, but<br/>we can save that for later.')
('Constance', 'While I was on my way to the North District to see<br/>the palace, I caught sight of the movie theater.')
('Constance', "It fits in surprisingly well with the rest of the city.<br/>It doesn't clash with its aesthetic one bit.")
('Constance', 'The contrast between the palace and the marketplace<br/>is striking by comparison.')
('Constance', 'I paid a visit to the grand cathedral after the<br/>memorial mass. It was simply divine.')
('Constance', "The guidebook certainly didn't do it justice, but I<br/>don't think you can convey its elegance with mere<br/>words or pictures.")
('Constance', 'Sadly, while that experience sent me to cloud nine,<br/>the prices in the local department store brought me<br/>crashing down to reality.')
('Constance', "If only I had more money... I could've gotten more<br/>out of this visit had I not been drowning in<br/>financial woes.")
('Constance', 'This was my first time seeing an opera performance,<br/>and I can only describe it as a<br/>breathtaking experience.')
('Constance', "I likely could've better understood the finer details of<br/>the story had I received a higher education—and if I<br/>saw it a few more times.")
('Constance', "Nonetheless, I was drawn in by the<br/>stellar performances. There's a level of depth there<br/>you don't see in stage dramas and movies.")
('Constance', "Now, then. I've got some more time on my hands, so<br/>I think I'll tour the other districts.")
('Constance', 'The cityscape looks so much more grand in person<br/>than in the pictures.')
('Constance', "I'm glad I was able to come here as planned.")
('Constance', "The hard work of the brilliant artisans is on<br/>full display. We're fortunate our ancestors saw fit to<br/>preserve it.")
('Constance', "It's like I've been transported back to the time when<br/>the old royalty still existed. It's an incredible feeling.")
('Constance', "It's a good thing the Calvardian revolutionaries left<br/>this place intact. It's such a beautiful city.")
('Constance', 'The nobles back then were rotten to the core, but<br/>there was no need to punish the artisans for the sins<br/>of the upper class.')
('Constance', "The revolutionaries must've saw the value of<br/>preserving that history for future generations.")
('Sylvan', "The festival is drawing near, isn't it? I'd almost<br/>forgotten it after the tragedy of Creil Village.")
('Sylvan', "I hope it isn't canceled... The festival does bring in a<br/>lot of foreign tourists.")
('Sylvan', "They often stop by to see Oración. It's a peak<br/>moneymaking period for us.")
('Sylvan', 'I better work on my sales pitches. This is a sensitive<br/>time, so I have to be careful about what I say.')
('Sylvan', "I made a killing today. Edith folks sure are well off,<br/>aren't they?")
('Sylvan', 'To be honest, I feel a little guilty making money off<br/>tourists during these dark times.')
('Sylvan', 'Be that as it may, old-fashioned Calvardian<br/>handicrafts are a hot commodity right now.')
('Sylvan', 'People all around the country care for the cultural<br/>heritage of their homeland.')
('Sylvan', 'You may notice that the department store carries the<br/>same branded goods as us.')
('Sylvan', "The difference is, our goods are cheaper, so you're<br/>better off buying from us.")
('Sylvan', "Oración's got a multitude of well-known handicraft<br/>goods producers.")
('Sylvan', "My job's to look through the vast selection of goods<br/>they sell and pick out the ones I think tourists<br/>would like.")
('Sylvan', "Hey there! Looking for some handicrafts to<br/>remember your trip by? Well, you've come to the<br/>right place!")
('Sylvan', "We've got everything from fine art made by notable<br/>artisans to popular souvenir goods—all at a low price.")
('Sylvan', "I've got something for customers of all stripes, so have<br/>a look around.")
('Sylvan', 'The department store sells souvenirs, too, of course,<br/>but their prices are through the roof.')
('Sylvan', "It's up to you whether you want to blow your wallet<br/>on one thing, or get a whole bunch of goodies from<br/>here with mira to spare.")
('Sylvan', 'One of our biggest draws is that each tourist can pick<br/>and choose what they feel is right for them.')
('Goethe', 'Usually I start baking celebratory cakes for the festival<br/>around this time.')
('Goethe', 'But with the tragedy still fresh on our minds, I<br/>decided that now may not be the time for it.')
('Goethe', "Though I suppose it's best to not let this dark mood<br/>linger forever. I'll just see what the customers request<br/>and go from there.")
('Goethe', 'Would you like a late-night dessert? I hear they go<br/>quite well with wine.')
('Goethe', 'Many of my customers stop by well into the evening<br/>to buy my sweets.')
('Goethe', "They say the taste compliments the city's<br/>atmosphere well. I'm not sure what that means, but<br/>you won't hear me complaining!")
('Goethe', "The Quincy Company is the most recognizable brand<br/>in Oración, but you'll find that my little store is just as<br/>well loved here.")
('Goethe', "However, few people outside the city walls would<br/>recognize our shop's name. That's because our<br/>products don't have a long shelf life.")
('Goethe', 'So be sure to send those sweets down the hatch as<br/>soon as you can!')
('Goethe', 'Welcome. Would you like a delicious<br/>Oración confectionery?')
('Goethe', "I know people are down after that horrible incident,<br/>but I don't want our city's visitors to be sad the whole<br/>time they're here.")
('Goethe', "My store's sweets are very popular with tourists.<br/>If they can help brighten people's moods, I'd<br/>be overjoyed.")
('Sutton', 'Okay, I got my fill of movies for this trip. Time to go<br/>see the grand cathedral!')
('Sutton', "There's no way we'd come all the way to Oración and<br/>NOT check it out.")
('Sutton', 'It might help calm my nerves, too. There was a guy<br/>glaring at me while we were watching the movie.')
('Sutton', 'No idea what that was about, but it gave me<br/>the chills.')
('Sutton', "Oración's known for being old. Beautiful, mind you,<br/>but old.")
('Sutton', "I wasn't expecting to see a movie theater here.<br/>This city's becoming a fun place.")
('Sutton', "We'll check out the grand cathedral tomorrow.<br/>Right now, I wanna see the palace ruins.")
('Sutton', "I'm not a huge history buff or anything, but going to<br/>see the remnants of the old kingdom sounds<br/>interesting to me.")
('Sutton', 'I was able to update my company on our situation.')
('Sutton', "I'd like to get back to the capital, but since that isn't<br/>happening, I'll just enjoy my unexpected vacation.")
('Sutton', "Someone at the station was saying Edith's still under<br/>a state of emergency. Guess we're not going back<br/>there anytime soon.")
('Sutton', 'Might as well just relax and enjoy our extended<br/>stay here.')
('Sutton', "Work oughta foot the bill for lodging, so we don't<br/>have to worry about that, thankfully.")
('Morie', "I guess that's good, but are you sure we should be<br/>having the time of our lives when...you know, that<br/>horrible tragedy just happened?")
('Sutton', "C'mon, Morie. Acting all depressed isn't gonna<br/>solve anything.")
('Sutton', "If everyone in the world sat around and did nothing,<br/>who'd keep the economy going?")
('Morie', 'Fair point. I was kind of bummed that our time here<br/>was so short anyway.')
('Morie', "But let's not go too crazy. We should spend<br/>in moderation.")
('Sutton', "I was hoping we'd get to see the inside of the<br/>grand cathedral.")
('Sutton', "Now's not the time, though. We shouldn't disturb the<br/>memorial mass.")
('Morie', "Yeah. We can drop by when that's over.")
('Morie', "In the meantime, why don't we visit the<br/>North District? I wanna get a good look at the old<br/>palace ruins!")
('Sutton', 'Sounds good. Should be an interesting sight.')
('Sutton', "Well, then. Let's catch the next tram to the<br/>North District!")
('Sutton', "Okay, the palace and the market were cool and all,<br/>but my mind was BLOWN when I saw the theater.<br/>I can't believe there's one in this old city!")
('Sutton', "There's a few films there that were on my<br/>to-watch list. You up for catching a movie tomorrow?")
('Morie', 'Sure. Sounds fun.')
('Morie', 'Then we can go to the grand cathedral after that.')
('Morie', "It's almost time to see the grand cathedral at long last.<br/>Now that the memorial mass is over, we should be<br/>able to go right in.")
('Morie', "It'll be nice to see some actual culture after that<br/>Golden Blood film...")
('Morie', 'I expected the Oración theater to show more<br/>refined movies...')
('Morie', 'I mostly just want to see the grand cathedral since I<br/>love immersing myself in culture and history.')
('Morie', "But I wouldn't mind watching a movie with Sutton.")
('Morie', 'There ought to be some hidden gems in the North<br/>District, right?')
('Morie', "I know it has the market, but I'm kind of hoping<br/>there's a place where we can let loose and have<br/>some fun.")
('Morie', "Sutton's right. We can't do anything to resolve the<br/>situation, and us acting all depressed won't<br/>help anyone.")
('Morie', "I don't get to come by Oración all that often, so we<br/>may as well make the most of this chance to see the<br/>rest of the city!")
('Ricardo', "Let's see... Today's classes are Calvardian History I,<br/>Intro to Chemistry, and Intro to Geology.")
('Ricardo', "The classes are tough, but I learn a lot from them.<br/>They're not only intellectually stimulating—<br/>they're fun.")
('Ricardo', "If they were boring, I doubt I'd be able to endure<br/>taking them on top of my part-time job.")
('Ricardo', "It doesn't hurt to eat out on occasion. The prices here<br/>are...fairly reasonable, all things considered.")
('Ricardo', "After a long day of school and work, it's hard for me<br/>to work up the motivation to cook for myself.")
('Ricardo', "The food here's decently healthy, too. I'll take it over<br/>junk food any day of the week.")
('Ricardo', 'Oh, yeah. I think the waitress here is also working<br/>part time to pay for her school tuition.')
('Ricardo', 'Must be hard for a Central Eastern girl to live in<br/>this city. She probably has it much worse than me.')
('Ricardo', "I know what it's like to come all the way out here<br/>without a mira to your name. I wish her the best.")
('Ricardo', "Phew. I managed to get off early today. I'll get to my<br/>homework after a quick nap.")
('Ricardo', "None of my classmates understand what I'm going<br/>through because they're all sitting in the lap of luxury.")
('Ricardo', 'I just want one friend who can share my pain...')
('Ricardo', "Although, maybe I shouldn't be complaining at a<br/>time like this.")
('Ricardo', 'I finally got a part-time job! ...But that means I have<br/>to work in the evenings now, which is when I usually<br/>do my homework.')
('Ricardo', "I joined Oración University because it's a prestigious<br/>college, but man, the tuition is killer!")
('Ricardo', "And I've got rent and other cost of living expenses on<br/>top of that. *sigh* If only I'd been born into a<br/>rich family...")
('Tietta', "I wasn't expecting a surprise like this one.<br/>Maybe Aidios hasn't abandoned me after all!")
('Tietta', "I may be missing out on the EGC, and I'm not gonna<br/>be able to meet any fancy actresses.")
('Tietta', 'But this event should still be tons of fun!')
('Tietta', "Noooooo... Entry to the EGC is on a lottery system,<br/>and they've already ended applications to it...")
('Tietta', "I couldn't go to the film festival, and now I can't<br/>attend the EGC, either... I'm kicking myself for not<br/>looking up more info in advance.")
('Tietta', "I heard that Elaine's back in town! She's the pride<br/>of Oración!")
('Tietta', "She's just as beautiful as all the top models, and she's<br/>super strong and cool, to boot!")
('Tietta', "If she really is back in Oración, I'd love to catch a<br/>glimpse of her...")
('Tietta', "It sucks that I missed the film festival, but maybe I'll<br/>be able to see the EGC this year.")
('Tietta', 'So, Paulina. Have you ever heard about the EGC?')
('Paulina', "Yep! The radio said it's a biiig festival with models!<br/>But...the radio also said it might not happen<br/>this year...")
('Tietta', "Yeah, but we can't give up hope! Those models<br/>worked really hard, so surely they'll still run it!")
('Tietta', "I'll go check to see if it's still on!")
('Paulina', "Okie dokie! I've never seen you this excited before.<br/>It must be super fun!")
('Paulina', "Maybe I'll get to meet a famous actress...or a model...")
('Paulina', "Th-This thing sounds scary...but as long as Tietta's<br/>with me, I'll be okay!")
('Paulina', "C'mon, Tietta. It's okay! There's always next<br/>year, right?")
('Paulina', 'I-I wanted to go, too, but I can wait!')
('Paulina', 'W-Will I meet a famous model or actress at<br/>the EGC?')
('Paulina', "I'm kinda scared to go there, but I can do it if Tietta's<br/>with me...I think.")
('Gustav', "There's some sort of event going on. They rented the<br/>space only a few moments ago.")
('Gustav', "When I heard who the organizer was, though, I<br/>couldn't possibly say no.")
('Gustav', 'These two traveled all the way to Oración, and they<br/>have no interest in the opera house...')
('Gustav', 'Why? You can only experience it here!')
('Gustav', "Movies are all over the country. There's no need to<br/>waste precious vacation time seeing one.")
('Gustav', "Although, I'm more bothered by the fact that they're<br/>having that conversation here of all places. I'm on the<br/>verge of tears!")
('Gustav', "I'd love for tourists and young folk alike to experience<br/>the rich art and history found in opera.")
('Gustav', 'Art can only become one with our culture if it is<br/>experienced and shared by many people.')
('Gustav', "The opera house's owner, Ms. Adeline, is particularly<br/>devoted to opening the eyes of our youth to the value<br/>of traditional art.")
('Gustav', "Her belief that opera can match all entertainment<br/>mediums is absolute. It's awe-inspiring, really.")
('Gustav', "Welcome to Oración's opera house. I know the recent<br/>tragedy is still looming over us, but I encourage you to<br/>see one of our performances.")
('Gustav', 'Opera houses are on the decline due to the rise<br/>of movies. Not to mention, those pop tunes are all the<br/>rage with the youth of today...')
('Gustav', 'The world is moving on from opera, it seems. What a<br/>great loss that will be to the Republic.')
('Gustav', 'We must prevent such a future from coming to be.<br/>Those of us in the old capital must enlighten the<br/>people of Calvard to the best of our ability.')
('Sabine', "It's odd to see someone hosting an event for children<br/>at the opera house.")
('Sabine', 'Come to think of it, I believe I heard someone saying<br/>something about this on the orbal net.')
('Sabine', "I didn't look too deeply into it, though.")
('Sabine', "Everyone involved in the film industry is all the same.<br/>From producers to actors, they're all so vulgar.<br/>So base.")
('Sabine', 'No child of mine will ever walk into a theater for as<br/>long as I live. I will expose them only to the highest<br/>forms of art!')
('Sabine', "It's only a matter of time before children imitate the<br/>'art' they see on the screen and commit horrible<br/>atrocities all over the world.")
('Sabine', 'That Gotti person ought to be locked up when<br/>that happens. His violent, lubricious films may spell<br/>the end of civilized society as we know it.')
('Sabine', 'What a wonderful performance that was.')
('Sabine', 'Indubitably. Opera truly stands at the height of all art.<br/>Films cannot ever hope to match it.')
('Sabine', "Did you hear that Oración has its own theater now?<br/>Apparently, everything shown there is utter trash<br/>that's aimed at uncultured simpletons.")
('Germay', "That's hardly a surprise. Film directors and script<br/>'writers' are just hacks masquerading as artists.")
('Germay', 'But they are far less detestable than the actors.<br/>They are nothing more than talentless failures who<br/>lack the skills to be cast in opera.')
('Sabine', 'The fact that people can enjoy those degenerate<br/>works is unfathomable to me.')
('Sabine', 'But I suppose our government is to blame for that.<br/>They ought to provide better cultural education.')
('Germay', 'Movies will cause the youths of today to become<br/>desensitized to reality. Many will turn to lives of<br/>crime or try to attempt the impossible.')
('Germay', 'What a terrifying prospect... Let us hope that true art<br/>will spread once more and put a swift end to that<br/>abominable medium.')
('Judith', "(I can't BELIEVE what I'm hearing right now!<br/>Where do these people get off insulting everyone left<br/>and right?!)")
('Judith', "(This isn't 1175—we're in the thirteenth century here!<br/>What kind of ancient relic has THIS much beef<br/>against movies?!)")
('Van', "(Calm down, Judith. What they're sayin' ain't cool,<br/>but you don't wanna make a fuss and end up blowin'<br/>your cover.)")
('Judith', "(I know, I know... I'll bite my tongue and use this<br/>experience as fuel for honing my craft. I'll change<br/>their minds with my acting!)")
('Sabine', 'Did you hear about that scandal with the famous<br/>movie actress last week?')
('Germay', 'I did, but only a secondhand account of it. They say<br/>she had a one-night stand with a famous racer.')
('Germay', 'Apparently, that racer is known for seducing and<br/>discarding women one after the other!')
('Sabine', '*gasp* My word... Surely the movie actress must have<br/>known that. What a shameful woman!')
('Sabine', "That actress must've been no different from him.<br/>She's likely no stranger to disposing of men like<br/>yesterday's garbage!")
('Germay', 'Worse yet, I hear she commonly appears in those<br/>carnal exhibitions that Gotti person makes!')
('Germay', 'This just goes to show that morally repugnant movies<br/>beget morally repugnant people, whether actor,<br/>director, or viewer.')
('Sabine', 'Indeed. This serves as irrefutable proof that an actress<br/>who fails to reach the heights of theater will fall to the<br/>depths of depravity.')
('Sabine', 'What an unspeakable tragedy. I just want to turn my<br/>eyes from the whole sordid affair.')
('Judith', "(I can't BELIEVE what I'm hearing right now!<br/>Where do these people get off insulting everyone left<br/>and right?!)")
('Judith', "(This isn't 1175—we're in the thirteenth century here!<br/>What kind of ancient relic has THIS much beef<br/>against movies?!)")
('Van', "(Calm down, Judith. What they're sayin' ain't cool,<br/>but you don't wanna make a fuss and end up blowin'<br/>your cover.)")
('Judith', "(I know, I know... I'll bite my tongue and use this<br/>experience as fuel for honing my craft. I'll change<br/>their minds with my acting!)")
('Germay', "Goodness. I've never seen so many children in front<br/>of the opera house before. Well, I suppose it's fine—<br/>so long as they don't cause a ruckus.")
('Germay', 'Although, looking at them now, I see a number of<br/>children who are dressed in remarkably<br/>unrefined garments.')
('Germay', 'Who on earth is holding an event like this?')
('Germay', 'The movies that Gotti person makes are supposedly<br/>both immoral and obscene.')
('Germay', "It's inconceivable to me that people actually watch<br/>that filth, but I'm even more astonished that any<br/>woman would act in them.")
('Germay', "They must be the furthest thing from a proper lady.<br/>I imagine they're little more than dogs in heat<br/>without a fragment of shame.")
('Germay', "The only skill a movie actress must possess is having a<br/>fair body. All they're good at is arousing stimulation<br/>in lustful men.")
('Germay', "The same goes for the so-called 'idols' I hear so<br/>much about. I'm told their nigh-scandalous outfits<br/>expose a great deal of skin.")
('Germay', 'When I was young, we had a name for such<br/>people: harlots.')
('Diane', "I heard there was going to be an event for kids here.<br/>Is that what's going on in front of the opera house?")
('Diane', "Well, isn't that nice? It's been so very dour as of late,<br/>so it's always good to do something to clear the air.")
('Diane', 'I stopped by the market this evening. Bernice is such<br/>a generous woman.')
('Diane', 'She was in a good mood today because a merchant<br/>she has a good relationship with stopped by. I got<br/>some very good deals from her.')
('Diane', "If you've lived in this city for as long as I have, you'll<br/>come to appreciate the few folks who lend a hand to<br/>the lower class.")
('Diane', 'The average citizen in this city struggles to make<br/>ends meet.')
('Diane', 'If the situation remains as tense as it is, economic<br/>activity may come to a halt, which could drive food<br/>prices up.')
('Diane', "Maybe I ought to stop by Bernice's store in the<br/>North District...")
('Diane', 'Is it true that that village was destroyed? Oh, what a<br/>frightful age we live in...')
('Diane', "We've always had the occasional terrorist incident or<br/>uprising, but nothing so extreme as this.")
('Diane', 'People like us may very well become the next victims.<br/>How horrifying...')
('Officer Pascal', 'The kids seem to be excited for something or another.<br/>As for what specifically, I have no idea.')
('Officer Pascal', "There are no restrictions on holding an event, and we<br/>certainly won't snuff out a joyful little event that'll<br/>bring smiles to the children's faces.")
('Officer Pascal', "We'll just need to put more effort into our patrols so<br/>they can enjoy themselves without worry.")
('Officer Pascal', "Officer Katarina said she had personal business to<br/>attend to. Guess this'll be a solo patrol night.")
('Officer Pascal', "I've gathered that she's concerned about one of her<br/>friends, Officer Crema.")
('Officer Pascal', "I don't know the details since I won't go poking into<br/>a woman's private life. She applied for time off<br/>properly, so I'll leave her to her business.")
('Officer Pascal', 'At first glance, nothing seems to be amiss. The upper<br/>crust and the tourists are going about their days<br/>like usual.')
('Officer Pascal', "However, I'm certain I've seen some suspicious<br/>individuals about. I also don't understand why the<br/>bracers have called in additional support.")
('Officer Pascal', 'I would normally expect the citizens to be more<br/>alarmed, but they are shockingly calm. I find it a<br/>little disquieting.')
('Officer Pascal', "I wish I had a clearer picture of what's going on, but<br/>it's obvious that something's up. I better keep a close<br/>eye on the streets.")
('Officer Pascal', "One way or another, there are some duties that only<br/>we can perform. We'll do everything we can to keep<br/>the peace.")
('Officer Pascal', "Good morning. Are you from out of town?<br/>Would you mind if I asked who you are and what<br/>you're here for?")
('Van', "Sure thing. I'm just an everyday day laborer<br/>from Edith.")
('Van', 'I was employed by Anchorville to help with moving<br/>things over at the midway point, but then, well,<br/>yesterday happened.')
('Van', "I knew I wasn't gonna be gettin' back to Edith<br/>anytime soon, so I dropped by here. Figured I'd take<br/>up some cleaning jobs while I'm in town.")
('Officer Pascal', "Understood. Thank you for your cooperation.<br/>We're on the lookout for suspicious individuals, so<br/>we're on high alert.")
('Officer Katarina', 'The state of emergency has the top brass in a state of<br/>panic, and we have no idea why.')
('Officer Katarina', "Anyway, sorry to take up your time. We're just doing<br/>what we can to keep people safe.")
('Officer Pascal', "Yeah. Though I'm not sure I understand their<br/>orders, myself.")
('Officer Pascal', "They told us to identify and mark any jaegers sighted<br/>in town, but we aren't allowed to take any action<br/>against them. It's very peculiar.")
('Officer Pascal', 'Sure wish I knew what the people up top<br/>were thinking.')
('Risette', "(Just as I suspected. They've opted to keep the local<br/>forces out of the loop.)")
('Van', "(René probably had a hand in that. Makes it easy for<br/>us to go about our business, so I'm not complaining.)")
('Officer Pascal', "I know you're concerned about Officer Crema, but<br/>we can't get distracted from our own work.")
('Officer Pascal', 'The best way to help her is to do our jobs right so she<br/>can get plenty of rest.')
('Officer Katarina', "I know, I know... We'll just have to put in a bit more<br/>effort so she can be at ease.")
('Officer Katarina', 'Seeing the children be so full of cheer reminds me of<br/>why this job is so important.')
('Officer Katarina', 'We have a duty to protect their smiles!')
('Officer Katarina', 'I know that maintaining order in our jurisdiction is<br/>our job.')
('Officer Katarina', "But this situation is unlike anything I've<br/>ever encountered. I don't even know what we can do.")
('Officer Katarina', 'Some of the other officers are struggling with all<br/>this...in more ways than one, in some cases.')
('Officer Katarina', 'The entire country is in a state of emergency, and<br/>these orders have left us more than a little puzzled.')
('Officer Katarina', "Also, one of my coworkers in the North District is...<br/>going through a hard time. It's just one weird or bad<br/>thing after another.")
('Officer Katarina', "I imagine Officer Crema is having a hard time<br/>concentrating on her work. I hope she'll be okay.")
('Teto', 'Wow, this sounds, like, super fun!')
('Teto', 'May I go invite my friends real quick?')
('Teto', 'Oh, I need to get permission from Mommy, too!')
('Norbert', 'The people seem to be even more unsettled today<br/>than yesterday.')
('Norbert', "I suppose it's only natural. The entire Republic is in a<br/>state of disarray right now.")
('Norbert', 'All we can do is ensure that the people within these<br/>walls feel at ease.')
('Norbert', "There's something strange going on in this city.<br/>I'm getting goosebumps, but I can't quite place why.")
('Norbert', "Regardless, it doesn't change what I have to do.<br/>I must serve our guests to the best of my ability.")
('Norbert', "I'll just put aside my fears and focus on doing my job.")
('Norbert', "I'm not sure what happened exactly, but I can see<br/>Nelly's former cheer has returned. That makes me<br/>very happy.")
('Norbert', 'I wish her only the best. She has such a promising<br/>career ahead of her.')
('Norbert', 'Nelly has lofty dreams, and I want her to pursue them<br/>without worry.')
('Norbert', "Though I'm sure she'll have to face a number of<br/>obstacles along her path, especially in a city like<br/>this—where people are not kind to foreigners.")
('Norbert', "I can tell something's bothering her, but she insists<br/>she's fine. I think she's trying to avoid troubling me,<br/>but it's having the opposite effect.")
('Norbert', "Thank you for staying with us. We're happy to<br/>serve you.")
('Norbert', "Evidently, there's been a few shady characters around<br/>the city as of late.")
('Norbert', "Nonetheless, it's our job to provide legendary service<br/>for our guests, no matter who they are. If I can help<br/>you in any way, you need only ask.")
('Norbert', "Due to this tavern's popularity, the owner has high<br/>expectations of us.")
('Norbert', 'And we intend to rise above them.')
('Nelly', "I've been keeping an eye on the opera house, what<br/>with the contests and all.")
('Nelly', "I don't remember there being any events for<br/>kids scheduled. Did I miss something?")
('Nelly', 'Thank you all so much. I feel like my efforts—and<br/>those of everyone who helped me along the way—are<br/>finally being rewarded.')
('Nelly', 'But the best thing to come out of this was learning<br/>that Amalie had a ton of respect for me all along.')
('Nelly', "And if I want to keep it, I need to push myself<br/>even harder! You're on, Amalie!")
('Nelly', "Today was...a bit frightening, to be honest. It's been a<br/>while since I ran into discrimination on this scale...")
('Nelly', "Still, the bracers are already on it, so there isn't<br/>anything for guests like you to worry about.")
('Nelly', "I just...wonder if I'll be able to stay in this city.")
('Nelly', "I'm sure I'm causing trouble for everyone at school.")
('Nelly', "I really don't wanna suspect my classmates, but I get<br/>that we have to start somewhere...")
('Nelly', "I'm pretty sure Amalie's gone to the boutique today.")
('Nelly', 'Could you go talk with her?')
('Nelly', '*sigh* I guess... I guess this is where I have to<br/>face reality.')
('Nelly', "Oh! I'm so very sorry! I was lost in thought.")
('Nelly', 'Have you all had breakfast yet?')
('Nelly', "Norbert's cooking is wonderful, so I'm sure he'll whip<br/>up something amazing for you!")
('Nelly', "Welcome to our inn! If there's anything I can help<br/>you with, just give me a holler.")
('Nelly', "I might just be a part-timer, but I promise I'm just as<br/>dedicated to caring for our guests as Norbert.")
('Nelly', "I know what it feels like to be an outsider in this city,<br/>so I'm committed to giving a helping hand to any<br/>travelers that come here.")
('Nelly', 'I moved to Oración to attend its music academy, but<br/>for a while, I struggled to find work due to my<br/>Central Eastern heritage.')
('Nelly', "Norbert didn't care about that in the<br/>slightest, though. He brought me on board and made<br/>me feel welcome here.")
('Nelly', "That's why I'm working extra hard to show<br/>my gratitude.")
('Amalie', 'I never knew you worked at a tavern. And your<br/>employer is providing you with a room?')
('Nelly', "That's right. It's one of the perks Norbert offered me<br/>when he gave me this job.")
('Nelly', "I looked for work all over the city, but few places were<br/>willing to hire an immigrant like me. So I'm very<br/>grateful to him!")
('Nelly', "He's stood up for me time and time again whenever<br/>the customers complain about me. His kindness is<br/>more than I deserve.")
('Amalie', "Oh, for heaven's sake! That attitude is<br/>completely unacceptable!")
('Amalie', "You were chosen for the leading role, so have the<br/>confidence befitting of it! Don't sag your head—hold<br/>it up high!")
('Nelly', 'O-Oh! Yes, of course!')
('Van', "(They've definitely got a rocky road ahead of them,<br/>but somehow, I think it'll work out just fine.)")
('Nelly', 'So, umm... Are you free on the night of the<br/>next rehearsal?')
('Nelly', "I'm gonna do some more practice, and I'd love it if<br/>you could come with.")
('Amalie', "Oh! Well, I...suppose I can make time. I'll be<br/>expecting you to practice until you drop, though!")
('Emma', "Okay, my job here is done, so it's time to get going.<br/>I should make a point to visit the Republic<br/>more often.")
('Emma', "Maybe I'll go to Edith for the festival, assuming they<br/>still plan to hold it. I can visit all my friends there.")
('Emma', "I'll bet Deborah's still working at that<br/>department store. I wonder how she's been<br/>doing lately?")
('Emma', 'Okay, time for another break.')
('Emma', "The Republic's changed a great deal in recent years,<br/>and the same can be said for Ored.")
('Emma', "The new movie theater and circuit are nice, but I'm<br/>concerned about the investments received from an<br/>unknown Central Eastern company.")
('Emma', "Honestly, I'm getting dizzy just thinking about how<br/>much my home could change over the next few years.")
('Emma', "It's been a while since I traveled up here from Ored.<br/>I can't believe the universe picked now of all times to<br/>send the Republic into a frenzy.")
('Emma', 'I had some business to discuss, so instead of leaving<br/>everything to the vendor, I decided to come<br/>here myself. And then this happens.')
('Emma', 'The consignees appear to be okay. Before I do<br/>anything else, I should stop by their places and make<br/>the deliveries.')
('Emma', "This inn was my first stop. Once I finish my break,<br/>I'll go see how our best customers are doing.")
('Boss Philibert', 'Always nice to see Monique. Been ages since she<br/>stopped by.')
('Boss Philibert', "She always brings a job that's worth my time.")
('Boss Philibert', "I'll finish it up soon and hand her camera back to her.<br/>I'm sure she'll be happy with my work.")
('Boss Philibert', 'After the man finished his shopping, he left without<br/>a word.')
('Boss Philibert', 'The officer looked surprised, as I recall.')
('Boss Philibert', 'A familiar face dropped by a short while ago. It was a<br/>girl who used to live in the neighborhood.')
('Boss Philibert', "She was travelin' around, apparently, but she just got<br/>back home. Wanted me to fix up her camera—like<br/>old times.")
('Boss Philibert', "It's more rewarding to do business with a customer<br/>who's happy with my work as opposed to those<br/>blue-blooded types.")
('Boss Philibert', "Makes my perfectionist tendencies kick in. I'm gonna<br/>make her camera look good as new.")
('Boss Philibert', "Our workshop's been around for a long time.<br/>We serve people of all types—from upper-class<br/>citizens to travelers.")
('Boss Philibert', 'We handle fancy decorations as well as machines.')
('Boss Philibert', "I like workin' on the latter in particular. Always get a<br/>little giddy when someone walks through the door<br/>with some mechanical doodad.")
('Boss Philibert', 'Maintenance work is my bread and butter. I take<br/>pride in my skills as a machinist.')
('Boss Philibert', "Welcome to my workshop. You guys travelers?<br/>Now there's something I don't see every day.")
('Boss Philibert', 'Most of our customer base is upper-class citizens, and<br/>they always ask for repairs on decorations, as well as<br/>custom-made orders on occasion.')
('Boss Philibert', "If you want any custom work done on your<br/>weapons—or if you need simple fine-tuning and<br/>maintenance—then I'm your man.")
('Boss Philibert', "I've also got weapons of my own in stock.<br/>People mainly buy 'em for sport hunting, but they're<br/>as good as what you'd get from a real specialist.")
('Boss Philibert', "We've been doin' this kind of work for generations—<br/>well before the Orbal Revolution, in fact.")
('Boss Philibert', "Let me know if there's anything that catches<br/>your fancy.")
('Receptionist Luka', "I've known for a while that there was a plot<br/>encompassing the upper crust of Oración's society.")
('Receptionist Luka', 'Elaine has been investigating it for some time.')
('Receptionist Luka', "She couldn't do so openly due to her ties to her<br/>family, however. That's why I was quietly assisting<br/>her behind the scenes.")
('Receptionist Luka', "One way or another, I'm glad we can finally put this<br/>whole affair behind us.")
('Receptionist Luka', "But there's still the matter of Almata—and only you<br/>can put an end to them. Good luck, spriggan.")
('Receptionist Luka', 'So Elaine was partaking in the game as its<br/>twentieth team? I had considered that possibility at<br/>one point, believe it or not.')
('Receptionist Luka', "In any case, I'm glad she made contact with you.")
('Receptionist Luka', "Though I'm sure something's still weighing on<br/>her mind. Otherwise, she would've returned by now.")
('Receptionist Luka', 'I know you have an important battle ahead of you,<br/>but if you have some time to spare, please try to<br/>help her.')
('Receptionist Luka', "With everything that's been going on, I wasn't<br/>expecting Gray Arnold to go off on his own.")
('Van', 'I hear he came up here without permission. The boys<br/>up top chewed him out pretty good, yeah?')
('Receptionist Luka', 'Ah, so you were aware of what happened.')
('Van', "Gray? You mean that junior bracer? I didn't realize he<br/>was dispatched to Oración.")
('Receptionist Luka', 'Funny, Lahad said the same thing earlier.')
('Receptionist Luka', "Turns out, he wasn't cleared to come here. He left<br/>Edith and came up to Oración without approval.")
('Van', "Oooh. Someone's in trouble.")
('Receptionist Luka', "Yes, he explicitly violated the guild's code and put us<br/>all in danger. If his actions were against the game's<br/>rules, we'd be dead now.")
('Van', "Ah. Yeah, that would've been problematic.<br/>(He must've had some reason for doin' it, though.)")
('Receptionist Luka', "Anyway, we can't exactly send him back to Edith, so<br/>we decided to put him to work.")
('Receptionist Luka', "He's only a junior bracer, though, so he'll be on<br/>standby in case we need reinforcements.")
('Aaron', "So you're just gonna use him however you want?<br/>Amazed you can say all that with a straight face.")
('Receptionist Luka', "Of course. It's just an efficient allocation of resources.<br/>I assumed that sort of thing would be something you<br/>people could respect.")
('Van', "You ain't wrong.")
('Receptionist Luka', "First Elaine disappeared, and now Gray's gone off on<br/>his own...")
('Receptionist Luka', 'This irresponsible behavior is out of character for<br/>both of them.')
('Receptionist Luka', 'Regardless, our priority here is dealing with the crisis<br/>in front of us.')
('Receptionist Luka', 'Best of luck out there, spriggan.')
('Receptionist Luka', 'The upper zone has been cleared, but many teams<br/>still remain in the game.')
('Receptionist Luka', "I'm glad we formed an alliance with you, Arkride.<br/>You've gone above and beyond our expectations.")
('Receptionist Luka', 'My grandfather says you handle your subcontracted<br/>tasks with finesse. After hearing about your exploits<br/>in the game, I can believe it, I suppose.')
('Receptionist Luka', 'Sounds like your team is doing well in there.')
('Receptionist Luka', 'My grandfather says you handle your subcontracted<br/>tasks with finesse. I can see why he and Zin hold you<br/>in high regard, I suppose.')
('Van', "Hey, you didn't have to throw in that 'I suppose' at<br/>the end there.")
('Van', 'Wait, hang on. Your grandfather subcontracts to me?<br/>Does that mean...')
('Receptionist Luka', "Oh, did no one mention? You know Hazel, the<br/>general branch manager? He's my grandfather.")
('Receptionist Luka', "Judging by the looks on your faces, I see he didn't<br/>tell you. Why is he like that...?")
('Agnès', 'Yeah. We had no idea.')
('Van', "Guess I oughta be careful around you.<br/>Something tells me you're gonna be one hell of a<br/>scary lady someday.")
('Receptionist Luka', "I'll choose to take that as a compliment.<br/>You're welcome.")
('Receptionist Luka', "Anyway, I respect my grandfather a great deal. I'd feel<br/>a lot better if he was here in Oración.")
('Receptionist Luka', 'Right now, he and an S-rank bracer are taking<br/>command to ensure the safety of the capital and the<br/>Republic as a whole.')
('Receptionist Luka', 'And I have my own role to play in all this.')
('Van', "Is that right? Well, here's hopin' you inherited your<br/>granddad's good traits.")
('Receptionist Luka', 'I will take advantage of every resource at my disposal.')
('Receptionist Luka', "That includes you. We're fortunate that you're<br/>present here, Arkride Solutions.")
('Receptionist Luka', "Ah, hello. You must be Arkride Solutions. I've heard<br/>much about you.")
('Receptionist Luka', "The Oración branch is currently on high alert, though<br/>that isn't being publicized.")
('Receptionist Luka', 'Nonetheless, a bracer already lost their life in the line<br/>of duty...')
('Agnès', "Umm... If you don't mind me asking, who<br/>passed away?")
('Receptionist Luka', 'His name was Ewan. He was a young bracer who<br/>only just got promoted to B-rank. He had a bright<br/>future ahead of him.')
('Receptionist Luka', 'He was working alongside a veteran bracer, who was<br/>severely injured in the attack.')
('Van', 'So he was the same rank as Claussell. Guess whoever<br/>they were fighting was a real monster.')
('Receptionist Luka', "Indeed. We'll have to put the information Kirchheim<br/>brought back to good use.")
('Receptionist Luka', "Oh, speaking of which, he made an odd<br/>comment earlier. He said they went up against an<br/>enemy that they couldn't defeat.")
('Receptionist Luka', 'They wailed on it for a long time, but to no avail.<br/>I figured I should warn you.')
('Van', 'Oh, damn. Thanks for the heads up.')
('Bergard', "Should we run into such a thing, we'll be certain to<br/>make a hasty retreat.")
('Receptionist Luka', 'I thought we were prepared for whatever Almata<br/>could throw at us. Clearly, we were mistaken.')
('Receptionist Luka', "We must bring this crisis to a swift conclusion.<br/>That's the only way we can make it up to Ewan.")
('Receptionist Luka', "Remember to stay away from that enemy they<br/>couldn't defeat if you can.")
('Receptionist Luka', "We don't want anyone else to be killed out there.")
('Zin the Immovable', "Elaine's not comin' back tonight, is she?")
('Zin the Immovable', "Figured that'd be a long shot. She wouldn't have left<br/>if she didn't have a good reason.")
('Receptionist Luka', "Agreed. Though as for what compelled her to leave,<br/>she wouldn't say.")
('Zin the Immovable', "Well, shoot. If only we knew a friend from her<br/>childhood who she'd open up to. Wouldn't that<br/>be convenient?")
('Van', "(...He's as subtle as a brick to the face.)")
('Van', "(Guess I'll go diggin' through my memories. I bet I<br/>can figure out where she's loitering around.)")
('Agnès', '(...)')
('Bracer Kirchheim', "I was surprised to hear Mr. Auclair was with Almata.<br/>I'd actually been looking into Mr. Daltie for some<br/>time now.")
('Bracer Kirchheim', "I can't believe I failed to catch on to his scheme. I<br/>feel pathetic.")
('Bracer Kirchheim', "Perhaps...I looked the other way because I knew it'd<br/>make Elaine suffer.")
('Bracer Kirchheim', "It's hard to say, though. I may have just been blind to<br/>the corruption within Oración.")
('Bracer Kirchheim', "So Ewan's lover was able to move on? That's good<br/>to hear.")
('Bracer Kirchheim', "I'm sure leaving her behind was Ewan's<br/>greatest regret.")
('Bracer Kirchheim', "If she'd been trapped by her own anger and lost sight<br/>of her own future, I don't know how I would've faced<br/>him up in heaven...")
('Bracer Kirchheim', "But I don't have to worry about that now. I'm sure<br/>Ewan can rest easy.")
('Bracer Kirchheim', 'Ewan, the bracer who passed away, left behind a<br/>significant other.')
('Bracer Kirchheim', "I'm sure that's his greatest regret.")
('Bracer Kirchheim', 'They had to be secretive about their relationship since<br/>he was a bracer and she was a police officer, but they<br/>loved each other dearly.')
('Bracer Kirchheim', "Ewan's last request was that I take care of her, but...I<br/>can't do much as I am now.")
('Bracer Kirchheim', "Hey, spriggan. I heard you won the right to challenge<br/>Almata's boss.")
('Bracer Kirchheim', "Some members of the guild may not be able to<br/>verbalize it, so I'll say it in their stead: everyone's<br/>counting on you.")
('Bracer Kirchheim', "That said, we won't just be sitting here twiddling<br/>our thumbs. We'll make sure they regret taking Ewan<br/>from us.")
('Bracer Kirchheim', "I owe Ewan my life. I'd like to pay him back by<br/>putting an end to this...")
('Bracer Kirchheim', "I'm worried about Elaine, too... If only I could lend<br/>her an ear.")
('Bracer Kirchheim', '...')
('System', 'Kirchheim is in a deep sleep.')
('Van', "(Based on what people were saying, I'm pretty sure he<br/>went up against the Eradicator.)")
('Van', "(Doubt he's gonna be wakin' up anytime soon.)")
('Bracer Kirchheim', '...')
('Bracer Lahad', "Well, I've checked in on him, so it's time to head<br/>on out.")
('Bracer Lahad', "I'll be part of the ground forces for now.<br/>Depending on the situation, though, we might see<br/>some member changes.")
('Bracer Lahad', "This'll be a tough one—even for the A-rank<br/>bracers here. Careful out there, you guys.")
('Bracer Kirchheim', "Ewan, I'm...so sorry. I'm only here because...you<br/>protected me...")
('Bracer Lahad', "He only did what he thought was right. There's no<br/>need to be sorry.")
('Bracer Lahad', "We're just happy you made it back alive.")
('Bracer Lahad', "We'll handle things from here, Kirchheim. You just<br/>focus on getting some rest.")
('Bracer Kirchheim', 'Lahad... Take care of...Oración. And Almata...')
('Van', "He's asleep now.")
('Bracer Lahad', "Yeah, he had six broken ribs and several lacerations.<br/>It's a miracle he escaped on his own.")
('Bracer Lahad', 'Before he and Ewan were ambushed, they were<br/>looking into something in the labyrinth.')
('Bracer Lahad', "Apparently, the nuclear weapon isn't the only thing<br/>we have to worry about. Almata brought in<br/>something else, but we don't know what.")
('Bracer Lahad', "That's our warning to you, so try to make it count.")
('Feri', "Of course! We'll put a stop to Almata's plans!")
('Aaron', 'Nice of you to worry about us. Is that why you let us<br/>listen in on what he was saying?')
('Bracer Lahad', 'Haha. Who can say?')
('Bracer Lahad', "Let's all do our best out there. We'll make them pay<br/>for what they did to Ewan and save the 280,000<br/>citizens in the process.")
('Bracer Alvis', 'So, Ewan fought to the bitter end. That sounds just<br/>like him.')
('Bracer Kirchheim', 'He was your senior by half a year, right? I know you<br/>two had a friendly rivalry going on.')
('Bracer Alvis', 'Yes. Honestly, I was pretty frustrated that he reached<br/>B-rank before I did.')
('Bracer Alvis', "We may not be able to participate in the game<br/>anymore, but we can't let his efforts go to waste!")
('Bracer Kirchheim', "I feel the same. Sadly, I don't think there's much I<br/>can do in my current state.")
('Bracer Kirchheim', "Oh, right, I almost forgot to ask. Is it true that<br/>Elaine's gone missing?")
('Bracer Alvis', "Yes. No one's seen her since this morning.")
('Bracer Alvis', "I know that Elaine can take care of herself, but...I<br/>can't stop myself from worrying about her.")
('Bracer Kirchheim', "I wish I could help her. Both she and I grew up here<br/>in Oración, so maybe she would've opened up to me<br/>had I not been stuck in bed...")
('Zin the Immovable', "Once we're all set, let's head out and take the fight to<br/>the palace.")
('Zin the Immovable', "Don't worry about Elaine. She's gonna be fine.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'The best thing we can do for her now is to put an end<br/>to this nightmare.')
('Zin the Immovable', 'You leave things here to us.')
('Zin the Immovable', "Don't worry about Elaine. She's gonna be just fine.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Now you go on out there and give those Almata<br/>goons a good smacking for me.')
('Zin the Immovable', "We're still on the lookout for Elaine.")
('Zin the Immovable', "But finding her can't be our top priority in this<br/>situation, much as I hate to admit it.")
('Zin the Immovable', "It's just hard for me to believe she'd run off by herself<br/>now of all times.")
('Zin the Immovable', "Not gonna lie, losing Elaine right now's a huge blow.<br/>She left behind a gap that's hard to fill.")
('Zin the Immovable', "It'd be great if we found her, but given the<br/>circumstances, that doesn't seem likely.")
('Zin the Immovable', "We'll keep lookin' for her on our downtime, but till<br/>then, Fie and I are gonna have to go full throttle<br/>in fights.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Elaine may be missing, but we still have to focus on<br/>the task at hand.')
('Zin the Immovable', "Still, I'm gonna keep an eye open for her, and I'll ask<br/>that you do the same.")
('Elaine', 'Once again, thank you, Van. You gave me the chance<br/>to break the chains that bound me for so long.')
('Elaine', 'The first time we met, you gave me a hand, and you<br/>offered it time and time again when we were in<br/>school together, too.')
('Elaine', "You've helped so many times, I'm afraid I've<br/>lost count.")
('Van', "Nah, I didn't do nothin'. You've always been the one<br/>at the wheel of your life, Elaine.")
('Van', "I just like stickin' by your side and doin' whatever I<br/>can to support you—my own way.")
('Elaine', 'Van...')
('Fie', 'Oh, brother. Get a room, you two.')
('Zin the Immovable', "C'mon, Fie. Let's give the lovebirds a little privacy.")
('Elaine', "Wait, what? No! I mean, the death game's still—")
('Van', "Yeah, you're right.")
('Van', "You've put an end to things on your end, and now it's<br/>our turn to do the same.")
('Van', "Just kick back and relax for once in your life.<br/>You're long overdue for a rest.")
('Elaine', "You're right. Thank you, Van. And please, be safe!")
('Elaine', "You don't need to worry about me, Van.")
('Elaine', "I promise I'll get some rest now that I've finally put all<br/>that behind me.")
('Elaine', 'I have nothing to fear now.')
('Elaine', "So I want you to focus on bringing this whole thing<br/>to an end. I'll be waiting here... For you.")
('Fie', "President Auclair's condition has stabilized for the<br/>time being.")
('Fie', "He's left a heck of a mess for us to clean up, but I'm<br/>sure we can take care of it.")
('Fie', 'Sounds like President Auclair is willing to answer<br/>our questions.')
('Fie', "He's left a heck of a mess for us to clean up, but I'm<br/>sure we can take care of it.")
('Fie', "Anyway, now that we're out of the woods there, we<br/>can charge headlong into the palace. Let's end this.")
('Fie', "Anyway, now that we're out of the woods there, you<br/>can charge headlong into the palace. The rest is up to<br/>you, spriggan.")
('Fie', "It'd be nice if Elaine would come back to us...")
('Fie', "But maybe it's best that she sat this one out.<br/>The task's definitely gonna be a demanding one.")
('Fie', "Let us know if you find Elaine. Till then, we'll be on<br/>the lookout for her.")
('Fie', "Really hope she's okay...")
('Bracer Alvis', "To think Elaine's father was behind all this...")
('Bracer Alvis', "I can't imagine how she's taking this. Who could've<br/>guessed things would turn out this way?")
('Bracer Alvis', "I'll admit, when you brought up President Auclair, I<br/>thought I misheard you.")
('Van', 'I was surprised when I put two and two together, too.')
('Van', "Thanks for helping us find those leads, by the way.<br/>Your investigation's what brought them to light.")
('Bracer Alvis', "No, I don't deserve any thanks for this.")
('Bracer Alvis', "I'm sure I was turning a blind eye to it on some level.<br/>After all, he's Elaine's family...")
('Van', "Huh. That's surprisingly humble of you. Still, don't<br/>blame yourself.")
('Van', "I only figured it out because the facts were practically<br/>laid out right in front of me. Otherwise, I never<br/>would've guessed it was him.")
('Bracer Alvis', "Now who's the humble one?")
('Bracer Alvis', "I wish I'd investigated him more, but even if I had, I<br/>doubt I would've put two and two together.")
('Bracer Alvis', "No... I already knew something was off with Elaine.<br/>Maybe I could've guessed it was due to a<br/>familial matter.")
('Bracer Alvis', "I must've just been turning a blind eye to that<br/>possibility because it was the worst-case scenario.")
('Van', "Don't beat yourself up. Even I couldn't figure it out,<br/>and I've known her since we were kids.")
('Van', "Thanks to my mistake, we were too late.<br/>She's putting on a brave face, but this whole thing<br/>must be eating away at her...")
('Bracer Alvis', "Well, one way or another, we'll need to be there to<br/>support her.")
('Bracer Alvis', "We can't let this put an end to her bright future.")
('Van', "Yeah. I'm with you there.")
('Van', "Anyway, for Elaine's sake, we gotta bring this whole<br/>thing to an end.")
('Van', "You mind keepin' an eye on her while I go do that?")
('Bracer Alvis', 'Of course. No need to ask.')
('Bracer Alvis', 'Bring this game to a swift end, Arkride. For all<br/>our sakes.')
('Bracer Alvis', "I can't believe I'm about to say this...")
('Bracer Alvis', "...but the fact is, the trail Elaine blazed can only be<br/>walked by you. You're the only one who can make her<br/>efforts worth it.")
('Bracer Alvis', "Go defeat Almata—and make them pay for toying<br/>with Elaine's life!")
('Bracer Alvis', "Oh. It's you.")
('Bracer Alvis', 'I heard that Elaine went up against your group down<br/>in the labyrinth.')
('Van', "Yeah, she helped us win that round. We won't let her<br/>efforts go to waste.")
('Van', "Anyway, what'cha looking at?")
('Bracer Alvis', "Something that's for our eyes only.")
('Bracer Alvis', "Well, I guess I can share if we have info to swap.<br/>It's related to our suspicions that Almata has had<br/>some dealings in Oración.")
('Bracer Alvis', "I'm organizing all the information that was collected<br/>at this branch and combining it with what we've<br/>learned over the last few days.")
('Bracer Alvis', "I'm hoping it'll prove helpful somewhere down<br/>the line.")
('Van', 'Huh, neat. Well, good luck with that.')
('Bracer Alvis', "There's been a rumor floating around about a<br/>connection between Almata and a member of<br/>Oración's high society.")
('Bracer Alvis', "Almata's propaganda may very well strike a chord<br/>with them—given their own white supremacist views.")
('Bracer Alvis', "That said, a rumor's only a rumor until it's<br/>proven true. That's why our investigation has to<br/>be thorough.")
('Bracer Alvis', 'Ewan fought Almata to the last and managed to<br/>protect his friend all the while.')
('Bracer Alvis', "We'll hold a proper funeral for him at some point, but<br/>for now, all I can do is pray he finds peace in what<br/>he accomplished.")
('Bracer Alvis', "I'm worried about where Elaine's gone most of all.<br/>I've gotta keep it together.")
('Bracer Alvis', "I won't shirk my assigned duties, of course...")
('Bracer Alvis', "...but I'd really like to be searching for Elaine<br/>right now.")
('Bracer Alvis', "If any of you get a hint of Elaine's whereabouts,<br/>please tell me.")
('Van', "Sure thing, man. Just don't let it weigh you down too<br/>much, all right?")
('Bracer Alvis', 'Naturally, I have my reservations about you being<br/>involved in this game.')
('Bracer Alvis', "But I'm willing to follow Elaine's lead. Let's put our<br/>differences behind us for the time being.")
('Van', "I'm on board with that.")
('Van', "I'm glad you understand this ain't the time to be<br/>engaging in pointless antagonism.")
('Bracer Alvis', 'Urgh. Yes, I get it.')
('Bracer Alvis', "Ewan wouldn't want me to get wrapped up in a<br/>meaningless fight, nor would he want me to cause<br/>trouble for Elaine.")
('Agnès', 'Oh, is that Ewan the one who...umm...passed away<br/>this morning?')
('Bracer Alvis', 'Yeah. We joined the bracers around the same time,<br/>but he got promoted to B-rank a little before I did.')
('Bracer Alvis', 'Renton and I were always stuck playing catch up<br/>with him. And just when I finally managed to narrow<br/>the gap...')
('Van', 'Sorry to hear that, man.')
('Bracer Alvis', '...One way or another, I have faith that Elaine and<br/>Zin will find a way to resolve this situation.')
('Bracer Alvis', 'To ensure they can focus on the task at hand, I, along<br/>with everyone else here, will handle everything on<br/>the surface.')
('Bracer Alvis', "We're giving it our all, and I expect you'll do no less!<br/>Are we clear?")
('Van', 'Crystal. That was my plan all along.')
('Bracer Alvis', 'Oh, by the way, I wanted to ask. Does...Elaine seem<br/>off to you?')
('Bracer Alvis', 'I heard you two went out drinking the other night.')
('Van', 'Hmm? Whaddaya mean?')
('Bracer Alvis', "...Never mind. If you didn't notice anything, it's<br/>probably nothing.")
('Bracer Alvis', "Still, I can tell something's on her mind. If you notice<br/>anything strange, let me know.")
('Van', 'Will do.')
('Bracer Alvis', "Lahad and I will be doing requests and intel<br/>gathering with the group that's come from across<br/>the Republic.")
('Bracer Alvis', "Honestly, I'd rather be helping Elaine and Zin on<br/>the battlefield.")
('Bracer Alvis', "But if they need me to hold down the fort here, I'll<br/>gladly do so!")
('Bracer Lahad', 'Ah, hey. I heard about what happened this morning.')
('Bracer Lahad', 'You beat Elaine in a one-on-one fight and earned the<br/>right to challenge the big bad. Look at you go.')
('Bracer Lahad', "Don't rest on your laurels, though. It's now up to you<br/>to stop Almata in their tracks.")
('Van', 'Right. She passed the baton to us, so now we gotta<br/>carry it to the end.')
('Van', "I'm surprised you accepted that conclusion so<br/>easily, though. Figured at least one of you'd be<br/>in denial.")
('Bracer Lahad', "Well, I am a little frustrated since she's our friend.")
('Bracer Lahad', "But I've no reason to doubt that you beat her. I just<br/>have to accept you're the better fit for the job.")
('Van', "Huh. Well, thanks, I guess. I'll try to live up to<br/>your hopes.")
('Bracer Lahad', "You'll need to give it everything you've got out there.")
('Bracer Lahad', "We'll handle everything in the city, so you just get in<br/>there and do some damage.")
('Bracer Lahad', "One of your friends seems like they have something<br/>interesting planned. I'm curious to see what it is.")
('Bracer Lahad', 'Oh, yeah, I heard about what was going on<br/>with Elaine. Guess she wanted to deal with it<br/>all herself...')
('Bracer Lahad', "I'll go check on her later. Sounds like she's finally<br/>managed to put everything behind her.")
('Bracer Lahad', "Oh, sorry. As you can see, I'm a little busy at<br/>the moment.")
('Bracer Lahad', 'I thought I sensed someone lurking around earlier.<br/>Turns out, it was Gray all along.')
('Bracer Lahad', "I didn't realize he was struggling this much...")
('Bracer Lahad', "Well, he's here now, so he might as well make<br/>himself useful to us.")
('Bracer Lahad', "I'm sensing something. Could that be...?")
('Bracer Lahad', 'Hmm... Maybe not.')
('Bracer Lahad', "I've been sensing someone lurking about while I've<br/>been handling requests with the surface team.")
('Bracer Lahad', 'Maybe I should look into this more...')
('Van', "(I have no clue what he's talking about...<br/>Well, whatever it is, it doesn't concern me.)")
('Bracer Lahad', "I need to look into this. I feel like I'm going crazy.")
('Bracer Lahad', 'If my hunch is right, then this could turn into a<br/>big mess.')
('Bracer Lahad', "I suppose it's possible that he snuck in yesterday...")
('Bracer Lahad', 'Care to explain yourself, Gray Arnold?')
('Bracer Lahad', "You abandoned your post in Edith and snuck into a<br/>mission that's way too dangerous for a junior bracer<br/>like you.")
('Bracer Lahad', "Though I suppose you're more skilled than the<br/>average rookie. You were able to stay hidden for all of<br/>yesterday, after all.")
('Bracer Gray', "Look, I'm... I'm sorry. I know I shouldn't be here.")
('Bracer Gray', 'But I... I...!')
('Bracer Kazan', 'Oh, give me a break. Did you learn nothing from<br/>what happened last week?')
('Bracer Lahad', "Huh? Ah, right. You're talking about the stunt he<br/>pulled back in Longlai, right?")
('Bracer Kazan', "Yep. He dodged all our questions about what he was<br/>doing back then, and he's up to the same old<br/>tricks now.")
('Bracer Kazan', 'Though getting him reined in was a simple task—<br/>thanks to my handyman friend there.')
('Van', "For the record, I didn't take that request just to make<br/>life easier for you.")
('Bracer Gray', 'Oh, right. Thanks again for your help back then.<br/>I will repay you for—')
('Bracer Kazan', "Hey, don't get us off subject. It's time to tell us what's<br/>going on.")
('Bracer Kazan', "It's funny. When I got to Longlai, I pegged you as an<br/>oddball with a good heart.")
('Bracer Kazan', "I never thought you'd turn out to be such a rebel.<br/>Hate to see it.")
('Bracer Lahad', "I've actually gotten some reports about changes in<br/>your behavior.")
('Bracer Lahad', "Can you tell us what's going on—or do you not<br/>trust us?")
('Bracer Gray', "N-No, it's not that.")
('Bracer Gray', "It's just... When I heard the kind of trouble Almata<br/>was causing, I... I knew I had to do something.")
('Bracer Kazan', "Oh, yeah? So whatever's eating away at you is related<br/>to Almata?")
('Bracer Gray', "When the time comes—when it's all finally over—I'll<br/>tell you everything.")
('Bracer Gray', "After that, I'll accept whatever punishment comes<br/>my way.")
('Bracer Lahad', 'Ugh. You are one stubborn kid, you know that?')
('Bracer Lahad', "Fine, if this is THAT important to you, we'll lay off.")
('Bracer Lahad', "I'll be perfectly clear with you, though. Right now,<br/>you're still just a greenhorn, and you're also restricted<br/>by the rules of the game.")
('Bracer Lahad', "You'll be with the surface team until we get out of<br/>this hellish situation. Are we clear?")
('Bracer Gray', 'Yes, sir! Thank you so much!')
('Van', "(This kid's obviously got some beef with Almata.)")
('Van', '(Now that I think about it, Drusilla back in Longlai<br/>seemed to have realized something was up with him.)')
('Van', "(Well, I can't worry about this right now.)")
('Bracer Xiaoling', "Phew. The surface team's managed to keep a tight<br/>grip on information so far.")
('Bracer Xiaoling', "Though we've run into some trouble now that all of<br/>the other players have been eliminated.")
('Bracer Xiaoling', "But we'll deal with them all. You just leave it to us!")
('Bracer Xiaoling', 'Why in the world would that Gray kid sneak into<br/>this op?')
('Bracer Xiaoling', "He's even more defiant than Aaron, and that's a<br/>high bar!")
('Aaron', 'True, but you set the bar even higher than me.')
('Aaron', "I mean, you're an amazing martial artist, but you're<br/>stuck at C-rank because you can't stick to<br/>the mission.")
('Bracer Xiaoling', "H-How do you...? Grr... You've become even more of<br/>a smug little brat since the dojo days.")
('Bracer Xiaoling', 'Whatever. The final round is up next, right? Best of<br/>luck to you and the other bracers!')
('Bracer Xiaoling', "Whatever. The guild's out of the game, so we'll<br/>continue doing what we can from the surface!")
('Bracer Xiaoling', "Ewan lost his life because of this whole thing, so we<br/>can't back down now.")
('Bracer Xiaoling', "Still, we'll all need a good night's rest, so we're gonna<br/>hit the sack before long.")
('Bracer Xiaoling', "There's a lot we have to worry about—Elaine and<br/>Gray included—but we just gotta put those issues to<br/>the side and get some shuteye!")
('Bracer Xiaoling', "Hey there, spriggan. It's been a while, hasn't it?<br/>I've been hearing all about your exploits<br/>since Langport.")
('Aaron', 'Wassup, girl.')
('Bracer Xiaoling', "Don't 'wassup, girl' me, Aaron!")
('Bracer Xiaoling', "Aaanyway, we were all called here to deal with<br/>Almata, so I figured I'd bump into you all at<br/>some point.")
('Bracer Xiaoling', "Everyone here's in this together. We've got your back.")
('Van', "And we've got yours. Elaine and Zin may be the ones<br/>on the front lines, but you ain't out of the danger.<br/>Careful out there.")
('Bracer Xiaoling', "I heard Heiyue's going to be a part of the game, too.")
('Bracer Xiaoling', 'I wonder what they could be scheming...')
('Bracer Xiaoling', "Well, that doesn't matter now. Fact is, we've got a<br/>common enemy now, and that's Almata.")
('Bracer Xiaoling', 'Is Ikaruga really that strong?')
('Bracer Kazan', 'They are. I heard some nasty things about them back<br/>in the East.')
('Bracer Kazan', 'As it happens, a few people from my village ended up<br/>becoming jaegers like them.')
('Bracer Kazan', "If even half the stories they've told me are true, then I<br/>can believe they're the strongest corps.")
('Bracer Xiaoling', "Wow. It's rare to see you give such a<br/>serious assessment.")
('Bracer Xiaoling', "Now you've got me worried. I hope they don't end up<br/>crossing paths with Zin's team!")
('Bracer Kazan', "Fingers crossed. I'm still surprised they even bothered<br/>coming out here to the West.")
('Bracer Kazan', "Wait a minute. Is it possible that thing I sensed in<br/>Longlai was... No, I shouldn't be thinking about this.")
('Bracer Kazan', 'This rookie acts like a polite little boy one second,<br/>then he goes absolutely feral the next. This is a<br/>literal nightmare.')
('Bracer Kazan', "Well, we're stuck with him now. No way around that.")
('Bracer Kazan', "At least he's capable, which means he can handle a<br/>second round of work, work, work.")
('Bracer Kazan', "Hey, what's up? I wasn't expecting to run into you<br/>again so soon—and definitely not under<br/>these circumstances.")
('Bracer Kazan', 'Thanks again for your help back in Longlai.')
('Van', "No prob. Also, yeah, didn't think I'd bump into<br/>you here. This kinda high-stakes gig ain't normally<br/>your thing, is it?")
('Bracer Kazan', 'Nope, but duty calls. Drusilla heard they needed<br/>capable bracers and recommended me.')
('Bracer Kazan', "Well, as long as I'm on the surface, we're cool.<br/>Though I haven't taken on requests in a big city like<br/>this before...")
('Bracer Kazan', "...but I'm not gonna question the guys at HQ.<br/>Just gotta trust in them and do the best job I can.")
('Van', "Well said. And if you want my opinion, I'd say you're<br/>more than qualified to handle the biggest of big cities.")
('Van', "With skills like yours, you've got nothin' to<br/>worry about.")
('Aaron', "(Hmm? Oh, this is the guy from Longlai. So<br/>he's Eastern...)")
('Feri', "(I think I've heard about this guy... He might be from<br/>one of the northeast tribes.)")
('Van', "Oh, you're...Kazan, right? From the Longlai branch?")
('Bracer Kazan', "In the flesh. You're probably wondering why<br/>I'm here.")
('Bracer Kazan', 'After what happened to Creil, HQ wanted to put<br/>together a team of skilled bracers.')
('Bracer Kazan', "Drusilla recommended me, and well, I figured it'd be<br/>a chance to make a name for myself, but I didn't<br/>know what I signed up for...")
('Agnès', "I understand how you feel. It's certainly been a crazy<br/>turn of events.")
('Bracer Kazan', 'Well, nothing I can do about it now. Just gotta tough<br/>it out.')
('Bracer Kazan', 'I need to stay positive, do my job, and trust that the<br/>guys at HQ made the right call sending me here.')
('Bracer Kazan', "I've always wanted to work in the city, anyway.<br/>I'll just try to do my best.")
('Van', "I'm sure you'll do great. If Drusilla's singin' your<br/>praises, you're probably pretty damn good.")
('Van', "Knock 'em dead out there.")
('Bracer Kazan', "I didn't have to deal with Almata back in Longlai, so<br/>I never knew they had so many screws loose.")
('Bracer Kazan', "Who'd be crazy enough to bring jaegers and bracers<br/>together and say, 'Okay, now fight to the death!'<br/>It's pure insanity!")
('Bracer Kazan', "If I knew things would turn out like this, I would've<br/>turned down the recommendation without a<br/>second thought.")
('Bracer Kazan', "Well, now that I'm in this mess, I just have to trudge<br/>through it.")
('Bracer Gray', "I know I broke the code—and I understand that I'm<br/>just a junior bracer...")
('Bracer Gray', 'But after everything Almata did...and with them<br/>sowing fear across the Republic...')
('Bracer Gray', "I... I HAD to do something! I couldn't just<br/>stay behind!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Everyone! Over here! I'm the guide, so follow<br/>my lead!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "I know we've all been down in the dumps lately, but<br/>let's try to forget all that and have fun today!")
('Van', "(Huh? Where's she draggin' those kids off to?)")
('Van', "(Wait, I don't got time to poke my nose into this.<br/>I'll just trust that she knows what she's doing.)")
('Van', "(Only thing I gotta worry about is the fight that's<br/>ahead of us.)")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Okay, everyone, we're going to head out soon!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Follow my lead!')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "I'm not allowed to report on anything going on...")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "...but I know that wouldn't stop Dingo from trying<br/>to help! There has to be something I can do!")
('Van', 'Yeah, your investigative nose may actually come in<br/>handy here.')
('Van', "This city might be hiding a thread that'd unravel this<br/>whole mess, and a competent journalist like you could<br/>sniff it out.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'W-Wait, are you actually complimenting me?<br/>Who are you, and what have you done with<br/>Van Arkride?')
('Van', "Hey, c'mon. I can dish out some praise from time<br/>to time.")
('Van', 'Really, though, despite how Dingo acted, he had a<br/>ton of respect for you.')
('Van', 'And I put a lot of stock in his opinions.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'You say that, but Dingo would always try to slip away<br/>whenever I was in the vicinity.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "I know you're right, though. He was rude sometimes,<br/>but...I respected him, too.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'To the bitter end, he fought to deliver the truth.<br/>He was a hero.')
('Van', "Yeah, he was. And now it's time for you to pick up<br/>the torch.")
('Van', "But keep in mind, that doesn't mean you gotta do<br/>things exactly like him. He'd want you to make the<br/>most of your strengths.")
('Van', 'Not like you need me to tell you that, though.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Right. I know he'd want me to follow my own path.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "The truth can run, but it can't hide. If there's a lead<br/>that'll help us move forward, then I'll find it!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "I think I'll start by asking what the citizens think<br/>about the situation.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Then I'll look into what the police are up to.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'A good reporter never underestimates the value of<br/>mundane conversations. Leads often crop up where<br/>you least expect them to.')
('Renne', "Shouldn't you be preparing for the final battle?<br/>Don't tell me you're procrastinating.")
('Van', "We're workin' on it. What're you up to?<br/>Still investigating?")
('Renne', 'As it so happens, yes. Up until yesterday, I was<br/>getting a grasp on the situation in the city and<br/>looking into the forces present here.')
('Renne', "I've also been doing a number of favors on the<br/>down low.")
('Renne', "Today, though, I'm doing a little transmitting.")
('Van', "The heck you mean by that? Oh, you must be doin'<br/>information manipulation. Or hacking, maybe.")
('Renne', "That's quite the accusation you've laid at my feet.<br/>I'm doing nothing of the sort—this time.")
('Van', "Well, it's no skin off my back either way.")
('Van', 'Oh, and if you hear anything about Elaine, gimme a<br/>ring, all right?')
('Renne', 'Of course.')
('Renne', 'Keep in mind, though, that the value of any<br/>information you receive will vary depending on how<br/>you choose to act on it.')
('Renne', 'Always remember that.')
('Van', 'Damn. That was, like, philosophical and shit.')
('Renne', "Shouldn't Agnès be ready soon?")
('Renne', 'I need a pick-me-up. Scooping her up in my warm,<br/>loving embrace always recharges my batteries.')
('Renne', "Oh, and that's a girl's private secret. Spill the tea, and<br/>I'll hack your computer.")
('Renne', 'I may be playing the part of guild supervisor...')
('Renne', "...but if you need any assistance from me, I'm more<br/>than happy to help.")
('Renne', 'Although, depending on the request, I may have to<br/>do it on the sly.')
('Agnès', "Thank you, Renne. I'm sure we'll take you up on that.")
('Van', "(Her info network's so vast, it's almost scary. If she's<br/>offering, we might as well make use of it.)")
('Renne', "I'm offering in part because I owe you, but I also<br/>simply like what you do.")
('Renne', "You're free to make use of me as you see fit. If you<br/>need help, you know where to find me.")
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'It has been a blessing to see how much Ferida has<br/>grown over these last few months.')
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'Unfortunately, we do not have time to celebrate.<br/>We must first vanquish our enemies.')
('Vice Chief Hasan', "I will not let Almata steal my daughter's future!")
('Commander Geraint', "Ah, it's you.")
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'We owe you for yesterday. Seeing my daughter make<br/>strides on the battlefield filled me with pride.')
('Feri', 'Abi...')
('Van', 'Two jaeger commanders out shopping together?')
('Van', "Did Gehenna freeze over or somethin'?")
('Van', "Or are you guys just preppin' for the battles ahead?")
('Commander Geraint', 'The latter.')
('Commander Geraint', 'Thanks to you, our fight rages on, and that means we<br/>will go up against even more powerful foes.')
('Commander Geraint', 'We will procure any tool within our vicinity that will<br/>raise our chances of victory.')
('Van', "Damn, you guys sure are takin' this shit seriously.<br/>That's a jaeger for you, though.")
('Van', "Hope we don't bump into your crew.")
('Vice Chief Hasan', "We may have been eliminated, but that doesn't mean<br/>we won't have to take up arms.")
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'When it comes to Almata, it is best to expect<br/>the unexpected.')
('Vice Chief Hasan', "Also, should we have an opportunity to get a shot at<br/>their leader, we can't afford to miss it.")
('Vice Chief Hasan', "Well, with Ferida's help—and yours as well—we were<br/>able to attain victory...")
('Vice Chief Hasan', '...but there are still fearsome foes ahead.<br/>Marduk being one of them.')
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'Should we be unlucky, I may have to face my<br/>own son...')
('Feri', "I...really hope it doesn't come to that...")
('Vice Chief Hasan', "Well, if it does, don't worry. My blade will not yield<br/>to my heart. I would relish the opportunity to witness<br/>his strength for myself.")
('Commander Geraint', 'We may have been eliminated, but we still must<br/>remain vigilant.')
('Commander Geraint', 'Based on what happened to Aida, we know Almata<br/>will attack when we least expect it.')
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'You and Ferida have done well so far.')
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'The greatest of soldiers revel in overcoming<br/>insurmountable odds to achieve honor and glory.')
('Commander Geraint', "If you aren't careful, however, someone else may steal<br/>the killing blow and claim victory for themselves.")
('Commander Geraint', 'If you do not wish for that to happen, then win!')
('Commander Geraint', 'We must ensure Almata pays dearly for their actions,<br/>no matter the cost.')

('Van', "That thing's called an orbal tram. It'll take you<br/>anywhere in Oración.")
('Van', "They're good for scenic drives, but they ain't exactly<br/>built for speed. I'd only hop on one when you've got<br/>time to kill.")
('Feri', 'Darn. There goes that plan...')

('Bracer Alvis', "Oh, yeah. Your folks are here, aren't they, Elaine?<br/>Are you planning to pay them a visit?")

('Elaine', 'And I believe our temporary collaborator shares<br/>my sentiment.')
('Renne', 'Indeed. I will assist you all to the best of my ability.')
('Aaron', 'Damn. The air around this city is toxic as hell.')
('Feri', "You aren't wrong. There are powerful foes all<br/>around us. I can feel it.")
('Agnès', 'R-Really? But the town seemed so peaceful to me...')

('Van', "Bah. Never mind. What's the sitch, René?")
('Kincaid', "We're still ascertaining the names and numbers of the<br/>enemy, but I have learned which organizations are<br/>there at present.")
('Van', "Why don't you share with the rest of the class, then?<br/>We're all ears.")
('Kincaid', "First, the Bracer Guild's Edith branch turned up<br/>shortly after you, and they were joined by some<br/>capable bracers from elsewhere.")
('Kincaid', "Then we confirmed the arrival of Heiyue's White<br/>Orchid Dragon and Yin, and they likely have a large<br/>number of xiongshou accompanying them.")
('Kincaid', 'A few jaeger corps have joined the fray as well—the<br/>Warriors of Kruga and Eisenschild included.')
('Kincaid', 'The church sent two members of the Gralsritter, as<br/>well as elite members of Iscariot.')

('Kincaid', '...Oh, and your clients are there, too. They are likely<br/>lurking in the shadows as we speak.')
('Kincaid', "That's all I have. I shall leave the rest in your<br/>capable hands. I must turn my attention to the<br/>mountain of tasks that await me.")
('Van', 'Ugh. Just hearing him fire off those big names one by<br/>one was enough to make me nauseous.')
('Van', "And those were just the highlights. There's still the<br/>Nidhoggr corps and the Scorpions of Zahat, an<br/>established corps from the Central East.")
('Van', "The Dolor Family's here, too. They're the third<br/>largest mafia in all of Calvard.")
('Van', "Then there's the Stillwater Fleet and Zecht Arms.<br/>One of 'em is a group of sea jaegers, and the other's a<br/>new weapons manufacturer.")
('Quatre', "What criminal organization ISN'T in Oración at<br/>this point?")
('Aaron', "You got me there. Can't say I've heard of the last few<br/>names, though.")
('Judith', "But we're all too familiar with Ikaruga. I'll bet<br/>anything that white-haired girl is leading the charge.")
('Risette', "I'm all but certain that Marduk sent the elite unit led<br/>by Mr. Al-Fayed.")
('Feri', "I sensed him earlier, so I'd say you're right on<br/>the money. And I know for a fact that my people and<br/>Aida's corps are here, too.")
('Agnès', 'And the Republican Army is making their move<br/>in secret.')
('Agnès', 'Just what is Almata plotting?')
('Van', "Didn't you say that they leaked their current<br/>location themselves?")
('Bergard', 'I did. They invited us all to this place, knowing full<br/>well that they were painting a target on their backs<br/>in the process.')
('Bergard', 'They must be lying in wait as we speak. I imagine we<br/>will hear from them soon enough.')
('Bergard', "And then this 'carnival' of theirs will truly begin.")
('Judith', 'Oh, right. The guy in the armor asked me to take part<br/>in a carnival. Is that what this whole thing is about?')
('Van', "Yeah. I'd bet money on it.")
('Agnès', 'Oh!')
('Quatre', "Wh-Why's it going off now?")
('Bergard', 'That can only mean—')
('Feri', "Everyone's Xiphas are ringing all at once?!")
('Van', "No caller ID... I'm gonna answer it.")
('Dantès', 'Greetings, my friends. I thank you all for taking time<br/>out of your very busy schedules to come here today.')
('Dantès', 'My name is Gerard Dantès. I am the head of<br/>Almata—as well as the man you seek to destroy.')
('Van', '...!')
('Aaron', 'Not beating around the bush, is he?')
('Dantès', 'I am thrilled to announce that every one of our<br/>invitees are in attendance.')
('Dantès', 'No doubt you all were brought here under different<br/>circumstances, but your end goals are the same:')
('Dantès', 'To lead us off in chains—or lead us to an early grave.')
('Dantès', 'We thought about simply settling this with an all-out<br/>war, but the collateral damage would no doubt<br/>be immense.')
('Dantès', 'And we would never involve innocent civilians in<br/>our bloodshed! At least, not without an<br/>explicit purpose.')
('Dantès', 'So we went back to the drawing board...and we found<br/>a far more elegant solution.')
('Dantès', 'We decided to host a game—one that would make<br/>clever use of the sprawling labyrinth of underground<br/>ruins just below this city.')
('Dantès', 'The concept is quite simple. We will have you all<br/>engage in a fierce competition—where you will<br/>proceed to slaughter one another like rabid animals.')
('Dantès', "Ah, and there's the noon bell. The game's first round<br/>will begin exactly two hours from now.")
('Dantès', 'Each team has been assigned an entrance to<br/>the labyrinth. We will send each of you a map with<br/>their locations momentarily.')
('Dantès', 'Once you arrive, you will need to search for a keycard<br/>that we hid near your respective entrances.')
('Dantès', 'That about covers our overview. I look forward to<br/>seeing who I will fight at the end of these thrilling<br/>three days.')
('Van', 'These must be the rules of the game and the map to<br/>the underground.')
('Risette', "Let's have a look at them right away.")
('System', '1: The game begins at noon today and ends at<br/>11:59PM on November 22nd. At exactly midnight,<br/>Almata will leave the area and detonate the bomb.')
('System', '2: None of the participating players may enter or<br/>leave Oración—nor can they call on reinforcements<br/>from the outside.')
('System', '3: Any attempt to leak information on the game to<br/>the press or to the people of Oración will result in<br/>immediate detonation.')
('System', '4: Do not attack Vashtar Palace from the outside or<br/>attempt to infiltrate it by any means other than<br/>through the established game area.')
('System', '5: At the end of each round, a new underground area<br/>will be unlocked with a boss assigned to each.<br/>The last remaining team can enter the palace.')
('Quatre', "Th-This can't be happening...")
('Risette', 'Unfortunately, it is happening. We really are being<br/>forced to participate in a battle royale.')
('Risette', 'With the Genesis watching over us, we will have to<br/>comply and abide by these rules as well.')
('Feri', 'Right. If it catches us breaking any one of them, the<br/>whole city will be...destroyed.')
('Bergard', "Our options are limited with the entirety of Oración's<br/>populace being held hostage.")
('Aaron', "Hey, wait a second. If the bomb detonates early,<br/>they'll get caught up in the blast, too, won't they?!")
('Van', "No, these guys can teleport to safety whenever<br/>they want. Though even if they couldn't, I doubt<br/>they'd do this any differently.")
('Judith', 'These guys are utterly insane.')
('Quatre', "So this is how they planned to exploit the fruits of<br/>Professor Callaghan's labor. How utterly abhorrent.")
('Agnès', "I can't say I'm happy about how they're abusing the<br/>Geneses, either.")
('Bergard', 'There are less than two hours until this first<br/>round begins. We have little time to waste.')
('Bergard', 'What should our next move be, Van?')
('Van', 'I say we get out in the field right away.')
('Van', "We can't afford to just sit on our hands. Not with<br/>what's at stake here.")
('Van', "Eventually, we'll need to make our way over to the<br/>entrance and grab our keycard.")
('Van', "But first, I think we should walk around the<br/>South District. It'll help us get our bearings.")
('Agnès', "And while we're in the area, we can visit the guild<br/>branch there, too.")
('Feri', 'Sounds like a plan!')
('Van', '(Hmm... If these are all the rules, I might have<br/>an idea.)')
('Renne', "First, I will need a summary of everything that's<br/>happening in the surrounding area.")
('Renne', "We'll also need to touch base with the local police.<br/>The CID has ordered them to work with us.")
('Renne', "Bear in mind, though, they likely haven't been<br/>informed of the game, so be careful not to leak<br/>anything about it.")
('Renne', 'As for the underground—')
('Agnès', 'Renne!')
('Renne', "Oh, hello. I'm glad you all could join us.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'H-Hi, everyone!')
('Zin the Immovable', "So you guys are gettin' right down to business,<br/>too, eh?")
('Zin the Immovable', "I knew Almata wasn't gonna make things easy for us,<br/>but they've turned our expectations on our heads<br/>yet again.")
('Zin the Immovable', "Been a while, Roaring Lion. I'm happy to see you're<br/>still alive and kicking.")
('Bergard', 'Heh. Same to you, friend.')
('Feri', 'You two know each other?')
('Van', "Should've expected that. He probably knew my<br/>master through his own.")
('Zin the Immovable', "That's about the short of it. Just to be clear, though, I<br/>thought he died three years ago, too.")
('Zin the Immovable', "Anyway, Renne's gonna be serving as our supervisor<br/>while we're here.")
('Zin the Immovable', "She's also the liaison between the guild and the other<br/>factions in the city. We figured she'd be a perfect fit<br/>for the job.")
('Fie', 'I feel much better with her on board. She was a big<br/>help during the war two years ago.')
('Fie', 'I do feel a little bad, though. She has a lot on<br/>her plate...')
('Renne', "I certainly have my work cut out for me.<br/>Almata's sadistic scheming isn't making matters any<br/>simpler, either.")
('Renne', "But I'll manage. I'm quite proficient at multitasking,<br/>so this is well within my capabilities.")
('Agnès', "We're lucky to have you, Renne.")
('Van', "You go get 'em, tiger.")
('Van', "Wow, you've got a lot of bracers for this op, huh?")
('Aaron', "Even the Gekka tomboy's here. How's it goin', girlie?")
('Bracer Xiaoling', 'Not. In. The. Mood.')
('Zin the Immovable', "...Sorry. We're all a little on edge right now. We just<br/>lost one of our people today.")
('Feri', '...What?')
('Renne', 'Two bracers were exploring the underground<br/>labyrinth, and they ran into Almata—who were likely<br/>in the midst of preparing for the game.')
('Renne', 'They managed to bring back some valuable<br/>intelligence—but at a steep cost.')
('Fie', 'One of them was badly wounded...and the other<br/>passed away this morning.')
('Agnès', "That's horrible...")
('Judith', "I'm so sorry to hear that, you guys.")
('Elaine', 'I just finished getting ready, Zi—oh.')
('Agnès', 'Elaine!')
('Van', '...Hey.')
('Elaine', "I had heard you were in the city, but I didn't expect to<br/>run into you so soon.")
('Elaine', "I take it you've been worried about me after what<br/>happened yesterday?")
('Elaine', "Well, don't be. I'm fine now.")
('Elaine', 'With the stakes as high as they are, I can ill afford to<br/>be reckless—nor can I be too caught up in the past.')
('Van', 'I hear you there.')
('Van', 'How about we let bygones be bygones, then?')
('Elaine', "Yes, let's.")
('Elaine', "Since you are here, I'm sure you fully intend to dive<br/>headlong into the jaws of danger.")
('Elaine', 'Normally, I would suggest that you not take your<br/>assistants on that journey with you...')
('Elaine', '...but seeing as there is no safe haven here, I will only<br/>ask that you and your friends be careful.')
('Van', 'Of course. And you do the same.')
('Fie', 'We should probably get going, you two.')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Sounds good. Off to the underground, then.')
('Elaine', 'We will be counting on you all to handle everything<br/>up here.')
('Bracer Lahad', "Understood. We won't let you down.")
('Bracer Alvis', 'Watch your backs out there!')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "I'm gonna get to work, too!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "I may not be able to keep my editors in the loop<br/>about all this, but that won't stop me. If Dingo was<br/>here, he would do something about this.")
('Renne', 'If you need my help with anything—or if you want to<br/>talk—you know where to find me.')
('Quatre', "Thank you. We'll be sure to take you up on that if we<br/>need to.")
('Risette', 'Perhaps we could ask if the messages we received<br/>from Almata all contain the same information. Just<br/>in case.')
('Feri', 'This must be it.')
('Aaron', "Our keycard's waiting for us just on the other side of<br/>this door.")
('Judith', "Wow. This place is, like, right next to where<br/>we're staying. Convenient.")
('Quatre', 'We received instructions on how to open the<br/>door, yes?')
('Van', "Yeah, it came with the message we got. It's similar to<br/>how I open these kinds of doors back in Edith.")
('Agnès', "I take it this is the mafia's work, too, then?")
('Van', "Probably. Either way, we don't know what we're<br/>gonna run into in here, so be careful, you guys.")
('Agnès', "Okay, we've already taken a cursory look around<br/>this district.")
('Agnès', "I wish we could do the same for the others, but we<br/>don't have time.")
('Risette', 'Indeed. The first round will be starting very soon.')
('Feri', 'At least we were able to exchange info at the guild.<br/>We got our keycard, too.')
('Feri', 'Maybe we can take a quick breather while we wait<br/>for—')
('Van', "Sorry, but we can't. There's something we gotta do<br/>before we head into the game.")
('Judith', "Oh? And what's that?")
('Van', "Based on the size of the arena and the teams we're<br/>gonna be up against...")
('Van', '...our chances of winning and taking home the gold<br/>are slim to none.')
('Aaron', "Normally, I'd call you a pessimistic wuss for<br/>saying that...")
('Aaron', "...but you've got a point. We're up against Heiyue,<br/>top rank jaegers, and even our batshit clients.")
('Risette', 'Our group is rather small in comparison to much of<br/>our competition.')
('Risette', 'And though a few groups are lacking in numbers,<br/>they make up for it with their tactical support.')
('Feri', "That's definitely true of Abi and my brother.")
('Feri', "But we can't just throw in the towel!")
('Van', "Yeah, and we won't.")
('Van', "We just got a hole in the manpower department, and<br/>there's only one way to fill it: recruit more people.")
('Agnès', 'W-Wait, are you suggesting...?')
('Bergard', 'You wish to form an alliance with another team, I<br/>take it?')
('Van', "Exactly. And it'll be a completely equal partnership,<br/>of course.")
('Van', 'The other teams have all got their goals and agendas,<br/>as well as the resources to see them through.')
('Van', "Normally, they'd never form a partnership with<br/>anyone, but we've got the benefit of not bein'<br/>beholden to anyone. We're flexible like that.")
('Feri', "But wouldn't doing this break one of the rules?")
('Quatre', "'2: None of the participating players may enter or<br/>leave Oración—nor can they call on reinforcements<br/>from the outside.'")
('Quatre', 'Hmm... Would joining forces with another team<br/>classify as calling on reinforcements?')
('Agnès', "I don't think so. The rule specifically prohibits calling<br/>on them 'from the outside.' It doesn't say anything<br/>about doing so from inside the city.")
('Judith', 'Ha! Technicality saves the day!')
('Aaron', "It probably violates the spirit of the rule, but eh,<br/>who cares? It's their own damn fault for not being<br/>more clear.")
('Aaron', 'But who are we gonna turn to? And how are we<br/>gonna find them?')
('Risette', 'The guild is one option. We know where they are<br/>located, and they would very likely agree to<br/>your proposal.')
('Van', 'True, but there might be other good candidates,<br/>too—even if they come with more risk.')
('Van', "We've just gotta make sure it's a team that fits with<br/>our way of doin' things.")
('Van', "As for finding out where the other teams are, there's a<br/>friend of ours here in this city who might be able to<br/>lend a hand there.")
('Agnès', 'Oh! Renne!')
('Quatre', "Great idea. If anyone could help us with that, it'd<br/>be her.")
('Feri', "Then let's hurry on over to the guild!")
('Renne', 'Hello there. You look like you have something on<br/>your mind.')
('Agnès', 'We have something we want to discuss with you.')
('Renne', "That's quite the clever little scheme you've devised.")
('Renne', 'Leave it to Van to find and exploit the smallest of<br/>loopholes within the rules.')
('Van', 'So, think you can help us out?')
('Renne', "Of course. Who do you think you're talking to?")
('Renne', 'I already know the names of all the teams, their bases<br/>of operations within the city, and where their<br/>respective entrances are located.')
('Aaron', "How?! You haven't even been here an hour!")
('Judith', "Phew. I'm sure glad she's on our side.")
('Renne', "Of course, I can't spill all the tea, but I can at least let<br/>slip the current locations of the teams.")
('Renne', 'If you wish to have a successful alliance, I suggest you<br/>ally with a group that aligns with your principles.')
('Renne', 'Do you have a particular team in mind?')
('Renne', "The way you've handled your work thus far will<br/>determine who you can form an alliance with.")
('Renne', 'Do you have a particular team in mind?')
('Van', "(I think the only teams that'd consider allying with<br/>us are...)")
('System', 'Choose a team to go and meet with. Once you have<br/>chosen a team, you cannot change your decision.')
('Renne', "All right. You've still got a little time to decide, but<br/>you will want to decide soon.")
('Renne', "Come and see me once you've made up your mind.")
('System', "Your Law alignment level isn't high enough.")
('System', "Your Gray alignment level isn't high enough.")
('System', "Your combined Law and Chaos alignment levels<br/>aren't high enough.")
('System', "Your Chaos alignment level isn't high enough.")
('Van', "(I don't think they fit with our style, to be honest.)")
('Van', '(We should probably consider someone else.)')
('Van', "(We've already got a decent working relationship<br/>with the guild, so they might be our best bet.)")
('Van', "(They're also short on manpower, so they're likely to<br/>see this as a mutually beneficial arrangement.)")
('Van', '(I can see us butting heads on some things, though.)')
('Van', '(Cao and Yin are here on behalf of Heiyue.)')
('Van', "(It'd be hard to win 'em over, but Heiyue's a huge<br/>syndicate with connections on both sides of the law.)")
('Van', "(Might be worth tryin' to score an agreement<br/>with them.)")
('Van', "(What about the jaeger corps we ran into in Longlai?<br/>I'm sure that Divine Blade's with 'em, and she's<br/>crazy strong.)")
('Van', "(Dunno what they're after here, but if they were on<br/>our side, we'd have this game in the bag.)")
('Van', '(Definitely worth a shot, I think.)')
('Van', "(Those two society goons from yesterday are here,<br/>and so's the Direwolf.)")
('Van', '(Their strength is on another level—and that goes<br/>double for the Oathbreaker.)')
('Van', "(Can't believe I'm even toyin' with the idea, but<br/>maybe we should ask them to join our crew.<br/>High risk, high reward.)")
('System', "Are you sure you want to ally with the team you<br/>have chosen? After making your decision, you won't<br/>be able to return to the city for a while.")
('Van', "Yeah. We're gonna try our luck with...")
('Van', "Yeah. We're gonna try our luck with...")
('Renne', "All right. You've still got a little time to decide, but<br/>you will want to decide soon.")
('Renne', "Come and see me once you've made up your mind.")
('System', "Your Law alignment level isn't high enough.")
('System', "Your Gray alignment level isn't high enough.")
('System', "Your combined Law and Chaos alignment levels<br/>aren't high enough.")
('System', "Your Chaos alignment level isn't high enough.")
('System', 'Are you sure you want to ally with the team you<br/>have chosen?')
('System', 'After the alliance was formed, all that was left to do<br/>was wait for the game to begin.')
('System', 'Both groups passed the time by exchanging<br/>information until the appointed hour finally arrived.')
(500, 'November 21st, 1208, 5:03AM')
('Van', '...!')
('Quatre', 'Th-That felt like...')
('Aaron', "Yeah. It's the same feeling I got when that murderous<br/>maniac showed up.")
('Van', "What's up, René?")
('Kincaid', 'We have a problem.')
('Kincaid', 'I just received word that our Hercules β company<br/>acted against our orders.')
('Kincaid', 'They sent a squad to infiltrate the city from<br/>the outside.')
('Van', "Now, hold on a damn second. I thought your<br/>supervisors knew what was goin' on here!")
('Van', "We aren't allowed any reinforcements from<br/>the outside! And if someone breaks that rule...")
('Kincaid', 'I know. That is precisely why we attempted to keep<br/>word of the game from spreading outside<br/>our department.')
('Kincaid', "However, as I've told you once before, the CID is not<br/>as unified as I would like.")
('Kincaid', 'A department close to the army grew suspicious of<br/>what was happening in Oración and sent them in of<br/>their own volition.')
('Bergard', 'An idiotic move on their part—and we may all pay<br/>the price for it.')
('Van', "Hopefully not. They didn't know about the rules, so<br/>maybe this'll just be written off as foul play.")
('Van', "But since we don't know for sure, you gotta get them<br/>out of here ASAP! Who knows how those maniacs are<br/>gonna react?!")
('Kincaid', "We already tried to contact them, but they've cut off<br/>their comms. You aren't the first group I've notified,<br/>but I thought you should know—")
('Melchior', "Rise and shine, everyone! It's me, Melchior.")
('Melchior', "I hope you all had a good night's rest. I myself<br/>couldn't sleep a wink. The anticipation for today's big<br/>event has me bouncing off the walls.")
('Melchior', "But anyhow, I'm afraid this isn't a social call. I have<br/>another reason for calling so early in the morning.")
('Melchior', 'Our warning system activated a few moments ago.<br/>I believe a number of you already know what<br/>exactly transpired.')
('Melchior', "But for those who don't, allow me to break the bad<br/>news: a special unit connected to the government<br/>foolishly attempted to infiltrate Oración.")
('Melchior', "I'm afraid this is a clear violation of our rules—and<br/>you all know what that means. Say hello to Aidios for<br/>me, everyone!")
('Agnès', 'No...')
('Feri', "Th-The bomb's going to go off?!")
('Melchior', '...Fooled you! Ahahaha!')
('Melchior', "Don't worry, we aren't going to blow you up just<br/>because some dimwitted bigwig decided to meddle in<br/>affairs they don't understand.")
('Melchior', 'That would be woefully unfair...to us—the<br/>hardworking designers who poured their hearts and<br/>souls into making this game for you. ♪')
('Melchior', 'The observation system assigned a small penalty, but<br/>nothing more, fortunately for all. You should count<br/>yourselves lucky.')
('Melchior', 'Those poor, pathetic soldiers have all finally breathed<br/>their last, so all is well with the world.')
('Van', '...')
('Aaron', 'Damn it.')
('Kincaid', 'What an utterly avoidable tragedy...')
('Melchior', "I will delay the next round's start time to noon so you<br/>can all sleep in. I'd prefer you to come into the game<br/>bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.")
('Melchior', 'In the meantime, I bid you good night and sweet<br/>dreams—because a nightmare of bloody death and<br/>murder awaits you in the afternoon. ❤')
(500, 'November 21st, 9:50AM')
('Van', "The second round would be starting soon if it hadn't<br/>been postponed.")
('Van', "I'm gonna use this extra time to look around the<br/>north and east districts. What about you guys?")
('Agnès', "I'd like to accompany you, if possible. I wouldn't be<br/>surprised if there were requests for us, too.")
('Judith', "Normally I'd use the extra time to catch forty winks,<br/>but the whole thing from last night's got me<br/>all antsy...")
('Feri', "I don't blame you. Maybe getting out and about will<br/>help you shake off that nervous energy.")
('Quatre', "That's a solid suggestion. I think that would do us all<br/>some good, in fact.")
('Aaron', "Well, I don't know about 'all.' I hear old men require<br/>more sleep, so I say we make Van take a nap.")
('Van', "Why am I getting singled out here?! Master's older<br/>than me!")
('Bergard', "Heh. I'll have you know I'm quite spry for my age.")
('Risette', 'All joking aside, we should visit the main facilities in<br/>the north and east districts and check the bulletin<br/>boards for—')
('Van', "...Another damn call? When'd we become so popular<br/>all of a sudden?")
('Fie', 'We need to talk. Are you free right now?')
('Van', "Is this about that Hercules unit? 'Cause we already—")
('Zin the Immovable', "Nah, it's something else. The CID's already touched<br/>base with us about that.")
('Zin the Immovable', "Sounds like they've already recovered the bodies...<br/>Wish we could've saved them.")
('Fie', 'Yeah...')
('Fie', "...I'm sorry if this isn't the best time, but do you mind<br/>if we talk in person? It's important.")
('Van', "Sure thing. Don't mind chattin' with my<br/>fellow teammates.")
('Van', "Sure thing. We ain't competin' anymore, so I'm down<br/>to have a chat.")
('Fie', "Thanks. We'll be waiting here at the guild.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Any time before the start of the second round is good<br/>with us. See you soon.')
('Feri', 'I wonder what they wanna talk about?')
('Quatre', 'Good question. They sounded quite serious.')
('Agnès', "I can't say I'm not curious, but it sounds like they just<br/>want to talk with Van.")
('Van', "Eh, I'm sure they wouldn't mind y'all listening in.")
('Van', "We'll all swing by there together and see what's up.")
('Risette', "And while we're out, I suggest we do whatever is<br/>needed to prepare for the second round.")
('Bracer Alvis', '...!')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Oh, there you are.')
('Fie', 'Glad you could make it.')
('Van', 'You guys sounded pretty serious on the call.<br/>Everything all ri—')
('Bracer Alvis', "Do any of you know where Elaine's gone?!")
('Agnès', '...Huh?')
('Van', 'The hell do you mean?')
('System', "'There is an urgent matter I must attend to.'")
('System', "'I will be acting alone for the time being. I apologize<br/>for not discussing this with any of you beforehand.'")
('System', "'Please continue to aid Team Arkride Solutions in<br/>my absence.'")
('Agnès', 'Elaine...')
('Judith', 'This has to be some kind of a joke...right?')
('Zin the Immovable', "If only it was, but this handwriting's definitely hers.<br/>Probably dropped this note by here in the morning.")
('Zin the Immovable', "I was gonna ask if you knew anything about this, but<br/>I can tell you're just as clueless as us. It's written all<br/>over your faces.")
('Feri', 'Sorry... I wish we had better news for you.')
('Quatre', "She certainly isn't acting like her normal self.<br/>There was that incident in the capital, too...")
('Aaron', 'Yeah, but I thought she rebounded from that.<br/>Guess something set her off again.')
('Aaron', 'Yeah, but I thought she rebounded from that.<br/>Maybe losing yesterday set her off or something.')
('Bracer Alvis', 'H-How dare you belittle her!')
('Risette', 'Have some faith, Mr. Wei. I doubt an A-rank bracer<br/>would make this sort of choice on a mere impulse.')
('Van', '...')
('Van', "Anyway, thanks for fillin' us in. We'll keep an eye out<br/>for her.")
('Van', "Though I can't imagine us havin' much time to do<br/>that once the game starts up again.")
('Fie', "Hopefully we'll find her soon. This game's gonna be a<br/>lot rougher without her.")
('Zin the Immovable', "Sorry 'bout all this, you guys. I know you were<br/>counting on having her help.")
('Van', "Don't sweat it. Having any extra hands is a bonus,<br/>and you guys're carryin' a shitton of weight as is.")
('Fie', "Any help's better than none. Thanks a lot, you guys.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Try not to let it bug you too much. We all need you<br/>to have your head in the game.')
('Van', "Thanks. If we learn anything, we'll get in touch.")
('Van', 'Good luck with your work in the city, Alvis.')
('Bracer Alvis', '...Yeah. Best of luck to you as well.')
('System', 'After the second round came to an end, they parted<br/>ways with their allies and returned to the hotel.')
('System', 'However, they would have an early start the following<br/>morning, so they decided to prepare for the next<br/>round in advance.')

(500, 'November 21st, 6:00PM')
('Aaron', "Ugh. That wasn't nearly enough sleep. I'm just about<br/>running on empty here.")
('Agnès', "I'm exhausted, too, so I understand. Just try and hold<br/>out a little longer if you can.")
('Feri', 'Hang in there! I believe in you, Aaron!')
('Aaron', "Okay, spare me the motivational talk. I'll make it—<br/>just wish I had the energy to hit the town afterwards.")
('Quatre', "If hitting the town is even crossing your mind,<br/>you're fine.")
('Risette', "It's only 6PM, so all the shops in the city should still<br/>be open.")
('Van', "Good deal. Let's do as much prep as we can.<br/>And maybe we can take on a request or two, if we're<br/>feelin' up for it.")
('Van', "Don't overdo it with 'em, though. Getting through<br/>tomorrow is our top priority.")
('Judith', "I'd rather not stay up too late if I can help it. It's bad<br/>for your skin.")
('Bergard', 'Unless there is an urgent matter that requires our<br/>attention, we should make it back to our room at a<br/>reasonable hour.')
('Van', "(If we're done here, maybe we oughta go ahead and<br/>hit the hay.)")
('System', 'If you choose to return to your room and rest, the<br/>main story will advance.')
('System', 'As a result, some unfinished quests and unseen<br/>sub-events will disappear.')
('System', 'The group then gathered for dinner.')
('System', 'After enjoying a savory meal together, they split off<br/>into their rooms to get some much-needed rest.')
(500, 'November 21st, 9:04PM')
('Van', '(Wait...)')
('Van', 'You go on in, Quatre. I just remembered there was<br/>something I needed to take care of.')
('Van', "I'll be back in less than an hour, but if y'all wanna go<br/>ahead and get to bed, don't feel like you have to wait<br/>for me.")
('Quatre', "Okay. That's fine with me.")
('Quatre', "Wait a moment... You're trying to pull an Aaron,<br/>aren't you? Off to enjoy the nightlife, hmm?")
('Van', "Don't lump me in with him. We are not the same.")
('Van', "It's just guild business, promise. If anything comes up,<br/>just give me a ring.")
('Quatre', '...Ah, I see. Got it.')
('Quatre', 'Just try not to worry the girls too much, okay?')
('Van', 'Will do.')
('Agnès', "(I wonder if he's...)")
('Agnès', "(...No, I can't be thinking about that now. I've got my<br/>own work to do.)")
(500, 'November 22nd, 12:03PM')
('Quatre', 'The next round will be the last. The end is finally<br/>within sight.')
('Judith', "I don't know about you guys, but I'm psyched to get<br/>back in there and kick some mafia butt.")
('Bergard', "We will be leaving for the palace in less than<br/>three hours. If you have anything else you want to do<br/>before then, now's the time.")
('Agnès', "I'm sorry to spring this on all of you so suddenly...")
('Agnès', '...but would it be okay if I go off on my own for a bit?')
('Van', '...What?')
('Feri', 'How come?')
('Agnès', "There's something I want to try—and now is my only<br/>chance to do so.")
('Agnès', "I believe it would be best to get it done while you and<br/>everyone else are handling preparations. I'll be back<br/>before the final ro—")
('Van', "Okie doke. Dunno what you're up to, but knock<br/>yourself out.")
('Agnès', 'What?!')
('Aaron', "She didn't even finish explaining!")
('Van', "She doesn't have to—because I trust her. She's been<br/>learning a lot since she started workin' for me...")
('Van', "...and just by looking at her, I can tell she's itchin' to<br/>put that knowledge into practice somehow.")
('Agnès', "That's right. I do have a plan, but I have no idea if it'll<br/>work out. I at least want to give it a shot, though.")
('Van', 'Well, you know what they say: nothing ventured,<br/>nothing gained.')
('Van', "Guessin' everyone's cool with Agnès doing her<br/>own thing?")
('Judith', 'Of course. You go, girl!')
('Risette', 'If you require anything of us, we are but a call away.')
('Feri', "I think it'd be a good idea if one of us joined you.")
('Quatre', "I agree. I don't know what you're planning exactly,<br/>but we're more than happy to lend a hand.")
('Aaron', "Eh. I guess I wouldn't mind a change of pace. If<br/>you need my help, just say the word.")
('Agnès', 'You all really mean that?')
('Agnès', "Thank you. I'd be delighted to have your assistance.")
('Agnès', "Let's all do our best, everyone.")
('System', 'Select one additional member to accompany Agnès.')
('Bergard', "Heh. I'm curious to learn what sort of scheme<br/>she's hatching.")
('Van', "Well, whatever it is, we'll just have to leave 'em to it.")
('Risette', 'Indeed. We have our own part to play in this.')
('Risette', "And while they're away, I suggest we complete<br/>some requests. The guild and the CID sent a few<br/>our way.")
('Judith', "When the heck did they do that? Well, not like<br/>I'm complaining. I could use a good warmup before<br/>the real show begins.")
('Van', "Yeah, we should consider taking it on. Be nice to tie<br/>up all the loose ends if we've got the time.")
('Van', "All righty, then. We're on the clock now, so let's get<br/>to work!")
('Feri', "Understood! I'll give 110% to make up for the<br/>others' absences.")
('Quatre', 'We need to be ready for anything!')
('Aaron', "Let's hurry and get everything done in the city<br/>because the Almata pain train is about to leave<br/>the station!")
(500, 'November 22nd, 2:35PM')
('Judith', "It's almost time for the final round to begin, but<br/>they're still nowhere to be seen.")
('Van', "Sounds like Agnès is done with whatever she was<br/>workin' on, so I'm sure they'll be here before long.")
('Bergard', 'Our collaborators are ready to go, so as long as they<br/>arrive in time, there is no need to worry.')
('Feri', "I'm still really curious about what she's<br/>planning, though.")
('Quatre', "I'm still very curious about what she's<br/>planning, though.")
('Aaron', 'Seems like it involved a heck of a lot of prep work<br/>around the city.')
('Quatre', 'It seemed like it involved a good deal of prep work<br/>around the city.')
('Feri', 'L-Look!')
('Aaron', 'No way...')
('Judith', "Isn't that the airship we saw in Tharbad?")
('Risette', "That belongs to the princely family of Elsaim. I think<br/>it might be carrying all of the city's children on board.")
('Van', 'Good. That means the orphanage kids are safe.')
('Agnès', "I'm so glad everything went according to plan.")
('Feri', 'Agnès!')
('Quatre', 'W-Wait, does that mean...?')
('Aaron', 'THAT was what you were up to?')
('Agnès', "That's right. Officially, it's a sightseeing flight—to<br/>foster relations with the Central East and to<br/>commemorate the ending of the film festival.")
('Agnès', 'We spread awareness of it through the orbal network<br/>and with word of mouth—and said that all children<br/>of the city were invited.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'We put the connections Dingo left behind to<br/>good use!')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Last night, we reached out to the crown prince and<br/>asked if we could use the principality transport vessel.')
('Renne', 'I fully expected him to inquire about why we needed<br/>it, but no. He just rushed on over in that airship<br/>without a second thought.')
('Renne', "He is quite the character. I wouldn't be surprised if he<br/>was taking inspiration from a certain musician<br/>I know.")
('Feri', "They're gonna fly around outside the city for the next<br/>couple of hours. Then they'll return to Oración.")
('Feri', "That's one less thing we have to worry about as we<br/>head into the final battle.")
('Aaron', "They're gonna spend a couple of hours flying outside<br/>the city. Then they'll come on back to Oración.")
('Aaron', "That's one less thing to worry about while we head<br/>off to the final showdown.")
('Quatre', "They'll spend two hours flying outside of the city,<br/>after which they will return to Oración.")
('Quatre', "That'll take one concern off our minds as we head<br/>into the final battle.")
('Judith', "I'm genuinely speechless.")
('Bergard', 'Heh. An impressive feat, to be sure.')
('Risette', "Indeed. Even if the worst-case scenario should<br/>happen, the children will be out of harm's reach.")
('Risette', 'This was a brilliant scheme. You should be proud of<br/>yourself, Agnès.')
('Agnès', 'Not at all. Admittedly, this was just a self-satisfied<br/>gesture that might well have no meaning at all.')
('Agnès', 'But I just happened to remember what Dingo once<br/>said to Van.')
('Van', 'Think about what you can do, and what you want<br/>to do.')
('Van', "You'll find a clue on how to move forward in the gap<br/>between the two.")
('President Gramheart', "Very well. Make the most of your connections while<br/>you're away. The CID is at your beck and call.")
('President Gramheart', 'There are many truths that lie dormant in the gap<br/>between ideals and reality. You would do well to seek<br/>them out.')
('Agnès', 'I also recalled the words of my dad, and it just...<br/>spurred me to action, I suppose.')
('Agnès', 'After I thought up the idea, I spoke to Marielle<br/>and Renne, and we all decided to go ahead with it.')
('Agnès', 'By the way, I heard about what happened with Elaine<br/>through the guild.')
('Agnès', "I'm so sorry I couldn't be there at such an<br/>important time.")
('Van', "Why the hell are you sayin' sorry? You just earned us<br/>a huge win.")
('Van', "You even factored in the crown prince's debt to us<br/>and turned him into a chess piece for your<br/>master plan.")
('Van', "You've gotten pretty damn sneaky. We better watch<br/>out, or we're all gonna be your puppets before long.")
('Agnès', "I...don't think that will be happening anytime soon.")
('Feri', 'Heehee.')
('Quatre', "It's almost like you're utterly incapable of offering<br/>a genuine compliment.")
('Aaron', "(Tch. I'm gonna have to start pulling my<br/>weight more.)")
('Van', 'Sounds like our allies are on their way.')
('Van', "Let's go, guys. It's time to finish this.")
('Agnès', 'Right!')
('Aaron', "Let's do this!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'May Aidios be with you all!')
('Renne', "Do whatever must be done to ensure that Agnès'<br/>precautions will be for naught.")
('Feri', "I don't see any 4SPGs on the board.")
('Van', "That's weird. I thought the society was spreading the<br/>word that I'm in town.")
('Van', "Maybe they'll start rollin' in soon.")
('Aaron', 'Not like we can deal with them today, anyway.')
('Risette', "The game will begin soon, and we aren't sure how<br/>much time we will have in the evening.")
('Van', "Got a point there. Guess we'll just have to check<br/>back tomorrow.")
('Van', "Let's just worry about makin' it through the first<br/>round for the time being.")
('Agnès', 'Right. We need to prepare for the game.')
('System', 'The main story will advance once you enter the guild.')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Hey there.')
('Fie', 'Took you long enough.')
('Van', "'Sup, you guys.")
('Van', 'Oh, you guys are here, too?')
('Fie', 'Yeah. Alvis called and asked us to come back here.')
('Van', "So, what's the sitch?")
('Risette', 'Is something going on with Ms. Auclair? I hear she<br/>has gone to see her family.')
('Bracer Alvis', "Yeah, that's what she told us initially, but umm...<br/>Actually, let me start from the beginning.")
('Bracer Alvis', 'Let me start from the beginning.')
('Bracer Alvis', 'After the third round ended, Elaine returned to<br/>the guild.')
('Fie', 'I just thought she was coming here to clear her head...')
('Zin the Immovable', 'After a bit, she said she was gonna go see her folks<br/>back home.')
('Zin the Immovable', 'She looked exhausted, so I told her to enjoy some<br/>time off and get plenty of rest.')
('Fie', 'At the time, I just thought she was worn out from all<br/>those battles, but now I realize there was more to it<br/>than that.')
('Judith', "Wait, back up. What's wrong with her wanting to go<br/>back to see her family?")
('Bracer Alvis', "We'll get to that in a second.")
('Bracer Alvis', 'A while later, a courier named Hermès dropped off a<br/>letter from Elaine.')
('Feri', "I didn't know Hermès was up here.")
('Aaron', "The bike lady's up here?")
('Bergard', 'Why a letter of all things...?')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Inside the letter was that sheet of paper.')
('Quatre', "That's the bracer emblem, yes?")
('Aaron', "That's the bracer emblem, right?")
('Zin the Immovable', "Yeah. A bracer's always supposed to carry this on<br/>their person.")
('Van', 'Wait, so if she turned that in, then that means...<br/>No way.')
('Fie', "Yep. That's her letter of resignation.")
('Judith', 'She quit the bracers?! But why?')
('Fie', "No idea. She didn't go into that in the letter.")
('Aaron', 'What a mess.')
('Quatre', 'That just seems unbelievable to me.')
('Risette', 'The timing concerns me most.')
('Bracer Alvis', "You don't think she went to face Almata alone,<br/>do you?")
('Van', "Not a chance. That'd be a violation of the rules.")
('Van', "She would never do something that'd put the rest of<br/>us in danger.")
('Van', "Don't think she'd spare that kind of concern for<br/>herself, though...")
('Judith', 'So what in the world happened, then?')
('Judith', 'Or maybe the better question is what on earth is<br/>she doing?')
('Renne', 'I can answer that one.')
('Fie', "You know what Elaine's up to?")
('Renne', 'As a matter of fact, I do. Sorry about the hold up, by<br/>the way. I was tied up helping someone else.')
('Renne', 'Elaine came by the guild earlier today.')
('Renne', 'She asked me to do a small favor for her.')
('Zin the Immovable', "What? I didn't hear about this. What'd she ask?")
('Renne', 'She gave me a flash drive and asked me to verify the<br/>authenticity of the data stored on it.')
('Quatre', 'Elaine came back here just to ask you to verify<br/>some data?')
('Risette', 'Ms. Auclair returned to the guild just to ask you to<br/>verify some data?')
('Renne', 'Yes, and she left as soon as she got her answer.')
('Renne', 'The data was genuine. That much is certain.')
('Van', 'So what kinda data was it?')
('Renne', "That I don't know. Not for certain, at least.")
('Renne', 'It was all incomplete, but I could tell it entailed<br/>multiple mira transactions—and large ones, at that.')
('Renne', "This is pure conjecture, but I believe the data outlines<br/>the financial operations of a criminal organization's<br/>primary sponsor.")
('Renne', 'And that criminal organization is almost certainly—')
('Van', 'Almata, right?')
('Renne', 'Yeah.')
('Fie', "So Elaine's going after Almata's pocketbook.")
('Bergard', "Well, I suppose that's one way to bring them down.")
('Bracer Alvis', 'But why would she need to leave the bracers to<br/>do that?')
('Van', "Shit. I've got a bad feeling about this one.")
('Van', 'I gotta find her fast!')
('Zin the Immovable', "Any idea where she might've gone?")
('Renne', "She's probably headed to—or has already arrived at—<br/>the site of Almata's largest investor.")
('Renne', "I'm fairly certain the investor in question is a<br/>company—but I don't know which one it is.")
('Renne', "Though I can imagine her target is the person who's<br/>at the top rung of their corporate ladder.")
('Renne', 'If you can find that person, you will likely find Elaine.')
('Risette', 'Naturally, they have to be someone who resides<br/>in Oración.')
('Judith', "Okay, that means we've got 280,000 suspects.<br/>Any way we can bring that number down?")
('Fie', "If they're directing multiple sponsors, they must be<br/>someone who's wealthy and in a position of power.")
('Aaron', "So we're probably looking for a celebrity or a bigwig.")
('Aaron', 'That narrows it down.')
('Quatre', "So we're likely looking for a celebrity or a<br/>company executive.")
('Quatre', 'That narrows it down a fair bit.')
('Bracer Alvis', "I've got a couple of ideas as to who it could be.")
('Fie', 'Oh?')
('Bracer Alvis', "I've been doing an investigation of my own over these<br/>last few days.")
('Bracer Alvis', "I figured I'd make myself useful while I was up here<br/>on the surface.")
('Bergard', "Well, don't keep us in suspense. Who do you think<br/>it is?")
('Bracer Alvis', "The way I see it, there's two possible suspects.<br/>The first is the owner of the opera house. Her name<br/>is Adeline Monange.")
('Bracer Alvis', "She's independently wealthy and has deep ties to<br/>Oración's upper crust.")
('Bracer Alvis', "Word is she's got one heck of a bone to pick with<br/>people in the film industry.")
('Bracer Alvis', "Considering Almata went after two film festivals, I<br/>think it's entirely possible that she's backing them.")
('Bracer Alvis', "The other one is Fernand Audran, Oración's mayor.")
('Bracer Alvis', "Mayor Audran is the head of the conservative faction<br/>here, and he's hard on immigrants. He also interacts<br/>with descendants of the old nobility.")
('Bracer Alvis', "He could be using Almata as a tool to strike<br/>at immigrants. The idea is unnerving, I know, but it's<br/>not out of the question.")
('Feri', 'Both sound like they could be the sponsor head.')
('Quatre', 'Both sound like viable suspects.')
('Fie', "Hey, Van. Who do you think's most suspicious?<br/>You're a local, technically, so I'm curious about<br/>your opinion.")
('Van', "I wouldn't put much stock in it. I was just a kid when<br/>I was livin' here.")
('Van', "I'll give my take, though. Based on Alvis'<br/>findings—as well as the situation over<br/>the last few years—the most suspicious one is...")
('Van', "You've got a good eye, Alvis, but the conditions we<br/>outlined could match a couple of other people, too.")
('Judith', "Oh, you're right.")
('Van', "And there's one person in particular...")
('Van', "Anyway, I can only think of one person who's leading<br/>Almata's sponsors.")
('Van', "I can only think of one person who's leading<br/>Almata's sponsors.")
('Van', 'And that person is...')
('Bracer Alvis', "Yeah, you're probably right. They have to be the one.")
('Zin the Immovable', "Let's go find 'em right now, then. We might not have<br/>much time.")
('Fie', 'Right.')
('Van', "(Did I pick the right person...? Agh, I can't waste<br/>time thinking about this. We gotta move!)")
('Van', "All right. Let's go!")
('Bracer Alvis', 'W-Wait a moment. Did you just say...?!')
('Renne', 'Ah. That would explain a lot, actually.')
('Risette', "Oh, no. That's horrible...")
('Bergard', 'I sympathize with her.')
('Fie', 'Well, now that we have our answer, I say we<br/>get moving.')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Yeah. Just in case, though, we should send people to<br/>the other suspects.')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Can you handle that for us, Alvis?')
('Bracer Alvis', 'Of course!')
('Renne', "I'll go help him with that. Good luck with the<br/>main target.")
('Van', 'Thanks.')
('Van', "(Wait for me, Elaine. I'm coming!)")
('System', 'Earned')
('Agnès', "Isn't Nelly the name of the waitress at our inn?")
('Quatre', "Yes, that's right.")
('Van', "Wonder what's goin' on with her.")
('Nelly', 'How may I help you all?')
('Nelly', "Oh, yeah, you're the group that came here yesterday.<br/>You want me to whip up a meal for you?")
('Agnès', "That's okay. Thank you, though. We're actually here<br/>about your request.")
('Nelly', 'Huh?!')
('Van', "You're Nelly, right? We saw your 4SPG on the<br/>bulletin board.")
('Nelly', "Wait, you're the famous spriggan? Wow!")
('Aaron', "We left the inn to check the bulletin board, and now<br/>we're right back where we started. That's funny.")
('Nelly', 'So, umm... Can I go ahead and talk about the threat<br/>letter I received?')
('Nelly', "Oh, you're back. So can I tell you about the threat<br/>letter now?")
('Van', "Actually, we gotta do somethin' real quick.")
('Van', 'Mind if we check back with you later?')
('Nelly', "Oh, of course. Take your time. I'll be right here when<br/>you're ready to listen.")
('Van', "Sure. What's it say?")
('Risette', 'Perhaps we should discuss this in our room. I have a<br/>feeling this could take a while.')
('Van', 'All right. Have you got the letter on hand?')
('Nelly', 'Yes. Right here.')
('System', "'Filthy, parasitic immigrants like you have no place in<br/>our magnificent opera house!'")
('System', "'Abandon your dream to take the stage—or the wrath<br/>of Aidios will descend upon you!'")
('Agnès', 'How could anyone write something so horrible...?')
('Bergard', "Invoking our Goddess' name in this way is nothing<br/>short of impiety.")
('Quatre', 'The person who wrote this is<br/>obviously anti-immigrant.')
('Aaron', "This is one of the most pathetic things I've ever read.")
('Van', "Guessin' you don't see a lot of this stuff, given that<br/>Heiyue's got such a stranglehold over Langport.")
('Van', "Oración's a different story, though.<br/>Anti-immigrant animosity's more likely to seep<br/>through here.")
('Van', 'Some people in this city are determined to carry the<br/>antiquated beliefs of the old nobility to the grave.')
('Van', "It's almost like their life's calling is to harass people<br/>like Nelly.")
('Nelly', "You aren't wrong there. Most of the people here are<br/>kind, but there's a handful of rotten apples, to be sure.")
('Nelly', "This isn't the first time I've faced discrimination in<br/>this city. I can count the number of times this kind of<br/>thing has happened on two hands.")
('Feri', 'Then why are you still living here?')
('Nelly', "Because I love Oración. It's every artist's dream to<br/>live here. We all call it the city of art and tradition.")
('Nelly', "I've wanted to be here ever since I was a little girl.")
('Nelly', "I worked day and night for so long to get to where I<br/>am, and now I've finally earned the right to attend the<br/>music academy here.")
('Nelly', "I can't just throw it all away now.")
('Judith', 'Mmm. I can understand that feeling.')
('Van', 'Okay, so the music academy and the opera house<br/>connection tracks.')
('Van', 'Is there something that sparked all this? Like an event<br/>of some kind?')
('Nelly', "Yes, actually. We're borrowing the opera house for a<br/>concert recital.")
('Nelly', "It's still a little ways away, but I'm totally stoked for it.<br/>And that's in part because I got the lead role.")
('Agnès', 'Wow! Congratulations!')
('Quatre', 'So the threat letter is calling on you to give up the<br/>leading role.')
('Quatre', "They'll probably resort to violence if you<br/>don't comply.")
('Nelly', "That's what I feared...")
('Van', 'The opera house has been around for over a<br/>hundred years.')
('Van', "And in all that time, I don't think there's ever been an<br/>immigrant who's been at the center of the stage.")
('Van', 'I could definitely see that ruffling more than a few<br/>feathers in the anti-immigrant crowd.')
('Van', "I'm sure they'll stoop to some serious lows to get you<br/>out of the spotlight.")
('Agnès', "That's terrible.")
('Quatre', "If you don't mind me asking, why didn't you take this<br/>to the police or the guild?")
('Nelly', 'I wanted to be discreet about all this. If word gets out,<br/>the entire recital could be canceled.')
('Nelly', "It's been a labor of love from everyone involved, and<br/>my classmates have been giving it their all<br/>during practice.")
('Nelly', "I don't want their efforts to go to waste.")
('Judith', 'This is just like the film festival—from the threat<br/>letter to the calling upon of a dubious spriggan to save<br/>the day.')
('Nelly', "I should just give up the lead role, shouldn't I?")
('Judith', 'What?! Heck no!')
('Judith', "You worked your butt off and studied like crazy to get<br/>this far. That role is rightfully yours, so don't give<br/>it up!")
('Nelly', "But I... I don't think I have any other choice.")
('Van', "You don't wanna fight this? Then why'd you send out<br/>a request?")
('Nelly', "I guess I just wanted to hear an expert's opinion<br/>before I came to a decision.")
('Nelly', "Now that I know I'm in real danger, I'd rather just let<br/>this one go.")
('Van', "Well, you're the client. If you wanna call it here, then<br/>we'll be on our way.")
('Van', 'But are you sure this is how you want things to end?')
('Van', "If you let this guy go, they'll be back for more.<br/>As long as you have the will to take to the skies,<br/>they'll do everything they can to chain you down.")
('Van', "Things'll only escalate from here if you don't take<br/>a stand.")
('Van', "I bet they won't stop until you've packed your bags<br/>and left.")
('Nelly', '...!')
('Van', "You still haven't given me the details of your request.")
('Van', "Tell me what you really want. I'm all ears.")
('Nelly', 'I...')
('Nelly', '...')
('Nelly', "I want to be a part of the recital! I don't want to give<br/>up here!")
('Van', "Got it. Then you can leave everything to us—'cause<br/>Arkride Solutions is on the case.")
('Nelly', 'But...')
('Aaron', "No buts. We're gonna help you out, and that's final.<br/>Whoever's behind this will think twice about<br/>hurting you once we're through with them.")
('Nelly', "I suppose I can't change your minds, then...")
('Agnès', "That's right. Once we're committed to helping<br/>someone, we always see it through.")
('Bergard', "Don't you worry, young lady. We'll catch this<br/>foul criminal.")
('Risette', 'I suggest we start by gathering a list of suspects.<br/>Is there anyone you can think of who could have sent<br/>that letter to you?')
('Nelly', 'Umm... No, not off the top of my head.')
('Van', "I know doubtin' people you know ain't any fun, but<br/>we need someplace to start.")
('Aaron', 'Can you think of anyone who might want to snipe<br/>the leading role if you gave it up?')
('Nelly', 'I...suppose one person comes to mind.')
('Nelly', "Her name's Amalie.")
('Nelly', "She's another student at the academy—and she's<br/>hyper competitive.")
('Nelly', 'We were both the top picks for the lead spot.')
('Quatre', 'So if you were to step down, she would assume the<br/>leading role.')
('Quatre', 'That certainly qualifies as a motive.')
('Feri', 'What kind of person is she? Do you know what she<br/>thinks about immigrants?')
('Nelly', "I know she's a descendant of the old Oración nobility,<br/>and, umm... Well, I don't think she likes me<br/>very much.")
('Nelly', "I've never heard her say anything discriminatory about<br/>immigrants, but I can't exactly read her mind.")
('Judith', 'She definitely sounds suspicious to me.')
('Van', "Yeah, I agree. We'll start by talking with her.")
('Nelly', "Oh, but I don't know for sure that it's Amalie.")
('Van', "I know. We're not gonna lay any accusations. We just<br/>wanna chat with her.")
('Van', "Any idea where she'd be around this time?")
('Nelly', "I think she's at the boutique in the department store<br/>over by the East District. She wanted to pick out a<br/>dress to wear to the recital.")
('Nelly', 'I overheard her saying that in our last rehearsal.')
('Quatre', 'So we need to go to the Quincy Department Store.')
('Risette', "Let's depart, then.")
('System', 'Quest Threatening Letter started!')
('Nelly', 'So, did you talk with Amalie?')
('Van', "Yeah, we did. Let's move this conversation back to<br/>our room.")
('System', 'Van relayed what they heard from Amalie.')
('Nelly', 'Amalie really said all that?')
('Van', "Sure did. It's doubtful that she penned that letter.")
('Agnès', 'Heehee. You look relieved.')
('Nelly', 'I am. I totally had the wrong idea about her this<br/>whole time.')
('Nelly', 'So she really thinks of me as a rival...')
('Van', 'Glad we got that sorted out, but that means the<br/>number of suspects has dropped down to zero.')
('Feri', "If Amalie didn't write it, then who in the world did?")
('Risette', "We're back to square one, it seems.")
('Van', "Actually, we might be one step closer to the truth.<br/>I'm thinkin' our perp was setting her up to take<br/>the blame.")
('Quatre', 'Wait, what?!')
('Aaron', 'You think they were trying to frame her?')
('Nelly', 'H-Huh? What do you mean?')
('Van', 'Look at it from this perspective: Amalie has the most<br/>to gain if you dropped out.')
('Van', "She's the type to be easily misunderstood, and like<br/>you said before, she's a descendant of the old<br/>Oración nobility.")
('Van', "Anyone would think she's suspicious with a capital S.")
('Bergard', "It's a plausible theory, especially if our perpetrator<br/>holds anti-immigrant views.")
('Bergard', "After all, she herself is an ally of immigrants. She's an<br/>ideal target for them.")
('Nelly', 'I...can see that.')
('Aaron', "And if you start pointing fingers and playing the<br/>blame game, then that's all the better for them.")
('Aaron', "They must think they're sooo clever. Can't wait to<br/>bust their heads.")
('Judith', 'Do we have any idea who they are?')
('Van', "I've got a hunch. We should look into whoever's<br/>behind that survey. That thing stinks to high heaven.")
('Feri', 'You think so? I thought Amalie said the person<br/>giving the surveys was pro-immigrant.')
('Van', 'Yeah, I doubt that.')
('Van', "While it's true that the number of people with<br/>pro-immigrant beliefs are on the rise...")
('Van', '...in Oración, those voices are drowned out by the<br/>choir of anti-immigrant sentiment.')
('Van', "So if the results of that survey got posted, what do<br/>you think it'd look like?")
('Agnès', "Well, it'd probably skew in favor of the people who<br/>hold those anti-immigrant beliefs.")
('Van', "Bingo. If you were conducting the survey in good<br/>faith, doin' it here would fly in the face of<br/>common sense.")
('Van', "And that's exactly why I think that whole thing<br/>is bogus.")
('Quatre', 'Do you think the person doing the survey could be<br/>connected to the anti-immigrant movement?')
('Van', "That's exactly what I think. Might be connected to a<br/>hate group or a racist asshole in a position of power.")
('Aaron', 'So their goal this whole time was to root out people<br/>who support immigrants.')
('Judith', "How dare they do something so vile! We can't let<br/>them get away with this!")
('Van', "And we won't. We'll make sure they get what's<br/>coming to them—and we don't have to be picky<br/>about how we go about it.")
('Van', "Personally, though, I wanna do something that'll<br/>really rile 'em up, and I know just how to do that.")
('Nelly', "Does this mean I'm safe?")
('Van', 'Yep. You can go into your concert worry-free.')
('Risette', "We foiled the perpetrator's plans before they went<br/>into motion. He hadn't even secured the manpower<br/>he needed to force you out.")
('Nelly', 'What a relief.')
('Nelly', 'Thank you so much, everyone.')
('Agnès', 'It was our pleasure. We wish you both the best of<br/>luck with your recital.')
('Feri', "I'm sure you'll blow everyone's socks off!")
('Amalie', 'I would also like to extend my gratitude. Had you not<br/>stepped in, this insidious plot might never have<br/>been unraveled.')
('Amalie', "Although, I might've been of some assistance earlier<br/>on had a certain someone kept me in the loop.")
('Nelly', 'Sorry...')
('Aaron', 'You gotta put a little more faith in your gal pals.')
('Amalie', "I-I am most certainly NOT a 'gal pal'!")
('Amalie', "I simply didn't want a worthy adversary to walk out<br/>on me—and especially not before I had the chance to<br/>even the score.")
('Nelly', "Thanks, Amalie. You're such a good friend.")
('Amalie', "I-I told you, I'm not... Argh...")
('Nelly', 'Oh, yeah. I still need to get an outfit for the recital.')
('Nelly', 'Wanna go to the boutique with me?')
('Amalie', "W-Well... I suppose I wouldn't mind<br/>accompanying you.")
('Van', '*sigh* Kids, am I right?')
('Quatre', "You do realize that's a phrase only elderly people<br/>use, yes?")
('Van', 'Can it.')
('System', 'Quest Threatening Letter completed!')
('System', 'Earned')
('System', 'Received')
('Risette', 'Pardon us, sir. Are you employed by the opera house?')
('Gustav', 'I am. Can I help you?')
('Agnès', "We had a question for you, if you don't mind.")
('Agnès', 'Do you know when the opera house was renovated?')
('Agnès', "We know it happened sometime in the Middle Ages,<br/>but we don't know when exactly.")
('Gustav', "Oh, that's an easy one.")
('Gustav', 'It was renovated sixteen years after the<br/>Calvardian Revolution.')
('Gustav', 'So that would be 1116.')
('Feri', "Whoa, that's like...a long time ago!")
('Gustav', "Ninety-two years to be exact. I'm sure we will host a<br/>big event eight years from now.")
('Gustav', 'That is, assuming the opera house lives to see<br/>that day. Ahaha...')
('Gustav', 'The burgeoning film industry is taking the world<br/>by storm...')
('Gustav', '...and all the while, opera will be left gasping for air in<br/>its wake.')
('Quatre', 'Do you really think that will happen?')
('Judith', "Well, I for one don't.")
('Gustav', 'Hmm?')
('Judith', "It's true that movies are getting more popular by the<br/>day—especially with our generation.")
('Judith', 'Both, however, are totally distinct forms of art.')
('Judith', "Opera's able to capture the magic of live<br/>performances—and it's been refined over decades of<br/>iteration and practice.")
('Judith', 'The film industry still has a lot of catching up to do if<br/>it ever hopes to be on par with it.')
('Gustav', "You're absolutely right! I shouldn't let my anxieties<br/>get the best of me.")
('Gustav', "To think that my faith in opera wavered for even<br/>a moment. It's thanks to you that I can lay all my<br/>doubts to rest.")
('Agnès', 'Think nothing of it, sir. And thank you for answering<br/>our question.')
('Van', 'Okay, so ninety-two years is the answer.')
('Van', "But wow, Judith. Who'd've thought you could be<br/>so nice?")
('Judith', 'And why exactly is that a surprise?!')
('Judith', "I'm a fan of opera, myself. I spent a lot of time<br/>studying it to strengthen my own acting ability.")
('Judith', 'I have a stage actress friend to thank for inspiring me<br/>to do that.')
('Judith', "Yet even after all that hard work, I didn't have much<br/>to show for it. Turns out, opera's tough.")
('Judith', 'I had to grit my teeth when I came to that realization.')
('Feri', 'Judith...')
('Agnès', 'Once our work here is done, we should come see an<br/>opera performance all together.')
('Judith', "Yeah, I'd like that.")
('Feri', "Aha! Here's the red tram.")
('Aaron', 'The color really makes it stick out.')
('Van', "Let's get the number!")
('Feri', "It's 3451.")
('Quatre', 'That matches the number FIO recorded.')
('Judith', 'Phew. Finding that thing was a real hassle.')
('Van', "Surprised that it was, given that it's the only tram in<br/>Oración with a red top. Sticks out like a sore thumb.")
('Agnès', "I wonder why it's the only one with that color.")
('Van', "There's a story behind that, actually. Decades ago, the<br/>painters who were workin' on that tram got mixed up<br/>about which color to use.")
('Van', "It was scheduled to get a repaint job a few days later,<br/>but while it was in operation, a string of miracles was<br/>bein' spun.")
('Van', "On that very tram, separated families reunited, and<br/>quarreling lovers kissed and made up. People were<br/>meetin' famous celebrities on it, too.")
('Van', "Soon enough, all the citizens were callin' it the Lucky<br/>Red Tram.")
('Feri', "That's a cute nickname.")
('Van', 'Yeah, and it really caught on. It was so popular, the<br/>tram company decided to leave the paint job as is.')
('Van', "Since then, they've always made sure to have one<br/>red-roofed tram in operation.")
('Agnès', 'What a lovely story.')
('Van', "It was marketing gold that fell right in the tram<br/>company's laps. Helped them get a shitton of butts<br/>in seats.")
('Judith', "Aaand it's ruined now.")
('Van', "Hey there. We're Arkride Solutions.")
('Van', 'Got a quick question for you.')
('Van', "We're lookin' for a man in a suit and a female<br/>police officer. Did you see anyone like that recently?")
('Boss Philibert', 'Hmm? Ah, yes, I did. They were here about ten<br/>minutes ago.')
('Boss Philibert', 'The officer appeared to be tailing the man.<br/>The tension in the air was quite palpable.')
('Risette', 'Did the gentleman happen to mention where he was<br/>headed next, by any chance?')
('Boss Philibert', 'Funny you say that. The officer asked me the<br/>same thing.')
('Boss Philibert', 'After the man finished his shopping, he left without<br/>a word.')
('Feri', 'What? For real?!')
('Bergard', "It may be that he's decided to finally put an end to<br/>this affair.")
('Van', 'Yeah. We gotta hurry.')
('Boss Philibert', 'Huh? What are you all talking about?')
('Judith', "Oh, it's nothing you need to worry about. Thanks for<br/>the help!")
('Agnès', "So he isn't drawing this out any further.")
('Agnès', 'It sounds like this will all come to a head soon.')
('Van', "Yeah. He's done playing games.")
('Van', "I'm afraid she's gonna be drawn in like a moth to<br/>a flame.")
('Van', "He's probably bringin' her to a place that's out<br/>of sight.")
('Quatre', "Wouldn't that be difficult, though?")
('Aaron', "The whole city's crawlin' with goons and buffoons.<br/>Even the back streets oughta be crowded right<br/>about now.")
('Feri', "This is a toughie. Where do you think he'd try to<br/>lure her?")
('Van', "Hmm... Let's say that, for instance, our guy's a player<br/>in the game.")
('Van', "He could take 'em someplace out of the public eye—<br/>and away from all the major players—without<br/>breakin' the rules.")
('Van', "I can think of one place that'd fit all the criteria.")
('Van', '(Has to be the labyrinth entrance near the<br/>guild, right?)')
('Van', "(Nah, there's no way. He wouldn't go near the guild<br/>with a ten-arge poll.)")
('Van', '(Must be Oración Station, right?)')
('Van', "(No, wait, that area's too populated.)")
('Van', '(He wants the police officer to follow him—not lose<br/>him in the crowd.)')
('Van', '(Has to be the labyrinth entrance near the<br/>tavern, right?)')
('Van', "(Wait, no, that's our turf. Doubt he'd wanna go<br/>near us.)")
('Van', "(Although, I guess it's possible that he'd<br/>underestimate us, but there's an easier place to<br/>lure her.)")
('Van', "The parking lot near the city entrance. That's gotta<br/>be where he's headed.")
('Agnès', "Oh! I hadn't even considered that!")
('Risette', 'Are you certain, Mr. Arkride?')
('Risette', "If he is a player as you suspect, I sincerely doubt he'd<br/>want to go near the entrance, given that one rule.")
('Van', "I know, but it's the best idea we've got. Some of the<br/>players ain't right in the head anyway.")
('Van', 'Also, for all we know, he could be connected to<br/>Almata, like the officer believes.')
('Van', "Anyhow, there's no time to dawdle. If they start a<br/>fight, she might need some backup.")
('Judith', "Then let's hurry!")
('Van', '(The police officer and the man in the suit should<br/>be here.)')
('Van', '(We need to be prepared for a fight. Should we head<br/>in now?)')
('Van', "Okay, we're goin' in. Get out your weapons, guys!")
('Agnès', 'Right!')
('System', 'A few minutes prior—near the fountain in the<br/>South District...')
('Officer Crema', "First an exchange shop, then the department store.<br/>He's making it look like he's just doing some<br/>shopping, but he can't fool me.")
('Officer Crema', 'Where is he going now?')
('Officer Crema', 'The highway, maybe? No, he must have a car in the<br/>parking lot.')
('Officer Crema', "He's clearly not one of A's leaders, but I can still get<br/>some information out of him.")
('Officer Crema', 'Just wait a little longer, Ewan. I WILL get revenge<br/>for you!')
('Officer Crema', '...!')
(40401, 'Disguised yourself as an officer lady, eh?<br/>Surprised you went to all that trouble.')
(40401, "Drop the gun and put your hands where I can<br/>see 'em. Unless you want a bullet in your brain.")
('Officer Crema', '...')
('Officer Crema', "That's my line.")
(40401, 'You got a death wish, woman?')
(40401, 'Does Almata only hire the crazies?')
(40401, "Well, lunatic or not, your plan's as predictable as<br/>they come. You're tryin' to pick us off one by one<br/>since we ain't protected by the rules no more.")
(40401, "Pity you didn't bring any backup. Bad<br/>move, sweetcheeks.")
('Officer Crema', 'So this was a trap.')
('Officer Crema', "I have no clue why you thought I was in disguise or<br/>what you mean by 'rules,' but one thing's crystal clear:")
('Officer Crema', "You're members of the Almata mafia.")
('Officer Crema', 'I know your executives are hiding here in Oración!')
(40401, '...')
('Officer Crema', 'I have no business with grunts like you. I want to<br/>speak with the man in the armor and the girl who<br/>controls the doll.')
('Officer Crema', 'If you want to live to see tomorrow, you will bring me<br/>to them at once!')
(40401, 'Seems we got a little misunderstanding here.')
(40401, "And here I was, getting all stressed thinkin' that<br/>Almata was coming after the losers.")
(40401, 'You caused me so much grief for no damn reason.')
('Officer Crema', 'What...?')
(40401, "*sigh* I can't be bothered to explain all this. I'd rather<br/>just off ya and go about my evening in peace.")
(40401, 'Tell Aidios the Dolor Family sends their regards.')
('Officer Crema', '...!')
(40401, 'The hell...?!')
('Feri', 'Phew. Barely made it.')
('Van', 'Sorry to drop in on ya.')
('Aaron', "Except we're totally not sorry.")
('Van', "We're not here to pick a fight, so why don't we all<br/>just walk away and pretend this never happened.")
(40401, "That's not gonna fly, pal. We're gonna send ya<br/>straight to Gehenna!")
('Agnès', 'Officer Crema! Please get behind us!')
('Officer Crema', 'H-How do you know my name?! Are you—')
('Van', "Save the chitchat for later. We've gotta deal with<br/>these idiots first!")
('Risette', 'Commencing suppression of enemy forces!')
(40401, "Damn... You guys're good. What's your aim here?!")
('Van', "Nothing. Like I said, we weren't here to pick a fight<br/>with you.")
('Aaron', 'We were just helping out our runaway client.')
('Officer Crema', 'So you really are the famous Arkride Solutions, then?')
('Risette', "That's correct. Officer Katarina requested that we<br/>follow you.")
(40401, "Ugh. Didn't think we'd get into any fights with<br/>players in the city.")
('Van', "That's your own damn fault. Anyway, we'll be leavin'<br/>with her.")
('Officer Crema', "Now, wait just a moment. I'm not finished<br/>with them!")
('Officer Crema', "These guys are clearly mafia scum—and the only<br/>mafia gang that'd be in this city is Almata!")
('Officer Crema', "I won't let them escape—not until I get revenge<br/>for Ewan!")
('Van', "Hate to tell you this, lady, but I don't think you<br/>understand what's goin' on here.")
('Van', "Almost every cockroach from Calvard's criminal<br/>underbelly is crawlin' around here.")
('Van', 'We even got mafias from the western regions of the<br/>Republic, for example.')
('Van', "Just calm down and think about it for a sec. You had<br/>to have realized somethin' was up, right?")
('Officer Crema', 'W-Well...')
('Officer Crema', '...')
('Officer Crema', 'Now that you mention it, I did find it strange that<br/>HQ told us to leave them to their devices.')
('Officer Crema', "I'm guessing something sinister is unfolding behind<br/>the scenes—and for whatever reason, we<br/>can't interfere.")
('Quatre', "That's more or less the situation, yes.")
('Bracer Gray', "Oh, there you are, Officer Crema! We've been<br/>looking all over for you!")
('Bracer Lahad', "Well, look what we have here. If it isn't the<br/>Dolor Family.")
('Van', "Oh, hey. Didn't expect to see you guys here.")
('Bracer Gray', "Same to you. I'd like to ask what's going on, but first,<br/>we need to arrest these guys.")
('Bracer Lahad', "You won't be causing trouble here any longer.")
('Bracer Lahad', "We'll be placing you under arrest for the time being.")
('Bracer Lahad', 'You can enjoy some quality time with the other<br/>detainees we picked up here.')
('Bracer Lahad', "You won't be causing trouble here any longer.")
('Bracer Lahad', "We'll be placing you under arrest for the time being.")
(40401, 'Damn you, bracer scum!')
('System', 'Everyone helped secure the Dolor Family.')
('Judith', 'Okay. Thanks for taking those guys off our hands.')
('Bracer Lahad', 'And thank you for making it so easy to round<br/>them up.')
('Van', "All righty. We got a client to report to, so we'll be on<br/>our way.")
('Officer Crema', 'One moment, spriggan.')
('Officer Crema', "You know where Almata's hiding, don't you?")
('Officer Crema', "Won't you tell me?")
('Van', "I can't, sorry. That's what I was plannin' on telling<br/>you before you ran off.")
('Officer Crema', "But...why? WHY?! Was the amount offered too low?<br/>I'll pay double if that's what it takes!")
('Bergard', "Calm yourself, officer. Almata isn't an enemy you can<br/>face on your own.")
('Bergard', 'If you throw yourself into the fires of revenge, you<br/>will only get burned by its flames.')
('Bergard', "Don't throw away your life. Your loved ones—<br/>including those who have gone to Aidios—would not<br/>want you to lose your way.")
('Officer Crema', "You... You think I don't know that already?!<br/>Of course I do!")
('Officer Crema', "But that doesn't matter! The man I loved was taken<br/>from me...so do you expect me to sit around and<br/>do nothing?!")
('Agnès', 'Officer Crema...')
('Bracer Gray', 'Please calm down, Crema.')
('Bracer Gray', 'While we did come here in part to apprehend the<br/>Dolor Family...')
('Bracer Gray', '...we also had something to tell you.')
('Officer Crema', 'And that is...?')
('Bracer Lahad', 'Kirchheim asked us to tell you...')
('Bracer Lahad', "...Ewan's final words.")
('Officer Crema', 'Wh-What?!')
('Officer Crema', 'So Kirchheim finally woke up.')
('Judith', 'Was he in coma or something?')
('Judith', 'Do you mind if I ask what happened?')
('Bracer Lahad', 'A few days ago, he and Ewan were exploring<br/>the labyrinth.')
('Bracer Lahad', 'They noticed something was out of the ordinary and<br/>ran into Almata, who was busy doing preparations<br/>for...uhh...you know what.')
('Bracer Lahad', 'As a result, Almata attacked them and Kirchheim was<br/>rendered unconscious and in critical condition.')
('Bracer Lahad', 'Though he would not be alive right now if not for<br/>Ewan—who gave his life to protect him.')
('Judith', 'Ah. Now I understand why Officer Crema was so<br/>hellbent on revenge.')
('Officer Crema', 'Please tell me. What did Ewan say?')
('Bracer Gray', 'He said he was so glad he met you...')
('Bracer Gray', '...and that he was satisfied with the life that he led—<br/>as a bracer and a protector of this city.')
('Officer Crema', '...!')
('Bracer Lahad', 'Kirchheim also had this to say.')
('Bracer Lahad', 'He fought till his last breath. For this city—and for<br/>his injured friend.')
('Bracer Lahad', 'He has my respect. Ewan was one of the finest<br/>bracers I have ever known.')
('Officer Crema', "That's not fair.")
('Officer Crema', 'Putting on airs, acting like some cool hero...<br/>Saying he was satisfied...')
('Officer Crema', 'We had a date to the movies planned... We were<br/>going to get married!')
('Officer Crema', 'So why...? Why did you leave me behind?!')
('Officer Crema', '*sob* Aaaaaah!')
('Van', '...')
('Bracer Gray', "(There's no way those of us left behind can ever<br/>accept it.)")
('Bracer Lahad', '...')
('System', "As Officer Crema's cries echoed through the streets,<br/>Van's group paid respects to the fallen bracer.")
('Officer Crema', "That... That was quite a shameful display, wasn't it?")
('Officer Crema', "I think I just needed to let it all out. I'm okay now.")
('Agnès', "All right. But remember, we're always here if you<br/>need a shoulder to cry on.")
('Judith', "Yeah, no need to hold it all in. It's always okay to cry<br/>when you need to.")
('Officer Crema', "Heehee. I think I'll be fine, but I appreciate the offer.")
('Officer Crema', 'And thank you both for passing on that message.')
('Bracer Gray', "Of course. I just wish we could've done more.")
('Bracer Lahad', 'You should thank Kirchheim as well.')
('Bracer Lahad', "Now, then. I think it's high time we send those goons<br/>up the river.")
('Van', "Y'all have a safe trip.")
('Van', "In the meantime, I'm gonna go report to our client.")
('System', 'Van got in touch with Officer Katarina.')
('System', 'After a brief discussion, they agreed to meet in front<br/>of the police station that Officer Crema was<br/>assigned to.')
