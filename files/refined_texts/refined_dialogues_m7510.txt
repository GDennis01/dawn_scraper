('Melchior', 'Welcome, friends! How good of you to come.')
('Melchior', "You sure took your sweet, sweet time. What's wrong?<br/>Lost your sense of urgency now that the countdown<br/>has stopped?")
('Van', 'Screw off.')
('Aaron', "I've been looking forward to beating your ass.")
('Feri', "You're going to pay for everything you've done.")
('Quatre', "You've hurt everyone here to some extent—Risette<br/>and Feri in particular.")
('Risette', 'Melchior is a criminal of the highest order.')
('Risette', 'He and Dantès have done much evil—and will likely<br/>go on to do more if we do not stop them in<br/>their tracks.')
('Agnès', '...I bet the destruction of Creil was your<br/>handiwork, too.')
('Agnès', "Even if you yourself didn't pull the trigger, you<br/>drafted the plan personally. Tell me. Am I wrong?")
('Melchior', "Heehee. So you've been going through that reporter's<br/>belongings, hmm? Well, you almost hit the bullseye.")
('Melchior', "I didn't merely draft the plan—I dotted the i's and<br/>crossed every t. Only I could've envisioned such a<br/>marvelously devious scheme!")
('Melchior', 'Much to my delight, that wonderful little village was<br/>a rare model of racial harmony as well.')
('Melchior', 'The boss was beside himself with joy when I told him<br/>of my plan. We had to deliver results to our<br/>investors—and we did so by wiping Creil off the map.')
('Feri', '...')
('Judith', 'You evil piece of...')
('Bergard', "You know full well that those investors wouldn't have<br/>expected you to go so far.")
('Melchior', 'Oh, they most certainly did not. In fact, they were<br/>terrified beyond belief. Their reactions were<br/>utterly priceless!')
('Melchior', "Auclair's in particular was gold. You should have<br/>seen him! He went as white as a sheet, and his voice<br/>was quavering like a little girl.")
('Melchior', "I can hardly believe the famous Beauty's Blade is<br/>his offspring. She's rather lucky she doesn't take<br/>after—")
('Van', 'Shut up.')
('Melchior', '...')
('Van', "In my line of business, I deal with so-called 'bad'<br/>people on the regular. I don't discriminate as long as<br/>they've got SOME sense of right and wrong.")
('Van', "I'm willing to take work from Heiyue, jaegers, thugs,<br/>and, hell, even the society. My door's open to 'em all.")
('Van', "Not you, though. You're a special kind of bad.")
('Van', "You didn't just cross the line—you obliterated it.<br/>Then you and your boss continued on your merry way<br/>like nothing ever happened.")
('Van', "I know the Oathbreaker is partly to blame for how<br/>you turned out since he abandoned you and all, but<br/>frankly, I don't give a single shit about that.")
('Van', "All I care about now is sending your ass on a one-way<br/>trip to hell. I've heard enough of your goddamn voice.")
('Van', 'Whaddaya say to a one-on-one brawl?')
('Feri', 'Huh?!')
('Aaron', 'Are you serious?!')
('Melchior', 'Haha! What an amusing proposition. I assume you<br/>are planning to rely on that Grendel of yours, no?')
('Melchior', 'But even with that tool at your disposal, defeating me<br/>alone is too great a task for an empty shell like you.')
('Van', 'You son of a...!')
('Agnès', "(What does he mean by 'empty shell'?)")
('Bergard', '(As I feared...)')
('Melchior', 'I may not be privy to the finer points of your<br/>relationship to the boss, but I stumbled upon a rather<br/>enlightening detail about that very subject:')
('Melchior', "You were once held in one of the D∴G cult's lodges.<br/>Couple that with the knowledge that the boss was<br/>one of its high priests...")
('Melchior', "...and it's easy to imagine what exactly went down<br/>between you two.")
('Van', '...!')
('Agnès', 'Ahh!')
('Judith', '...?!')
('Quatre', 'H-He stabbed himself?!')
('Van', "W-Wait... You aren't...")
(40301, 'Hahaha... *cough* Oh, but I am. ❤')
(40301, 'If you offer up your life within Pandemonium, you<br/>will be reborn as an undead.')
('Risette', 'This is eerily reminiscent of the Immortals and the<br/>Great Twilight!')
('Bergard', 'So that is how Dantès still lives!')
(40301, 'Hahaha... AHAHAHAHA! Exactamundo!')
('Agnès', 'What...in the world are those markings?')
('Aaron', "He's just like the others that were resurrected. No, he<br/>might be even worse!")
('Melchior', 'Indeed. Their revivals were incomplete. Unlike them,<br/>I have become one with Pandemonium itself, so my<br/>power far surpasses theirs.')
('Aaron', "It's like when I turned into the Tyrant... No, this<br/>might be even worse!")
('Melchior', "Oh, yes. I heard about that beast. If I'm not mistaken,<br/>it appeared in a similar manner forty years ago.")
('Melchior', "Though it would've been limited in what it could do.<br/>I have become one with Pandemonium itself, so I can<br/>run wild to my heart's content.")
('Melchior', 'Now, then. It is time for the event of the century!<br/>The prelude to the end of everything as we know it!')
('Melchior', "Before the world is devoured by darkness, I'll<br/>enjoy a most wondrous feast! I'm going to<br/>dine on your blood!")
('Feri', "He's about to attack!")
('Judith', 'You are NOT taking a bite out of me!')
('Van', 'You bastard.')
('Van', "Don't let him get the upper hand! We're<br/>gonna trounce this psycho!")
('Melchior', "Ugh... What's this? Ahaha...")
('Melchior', "Don't tell me...the fun's over already?")
('Aaron', 'Thank the Goddess for that.')
('Risette', 'I trust you understand what happens when an undead<br/>has been vanquished?')
('Feri', 'Time for you to accept your fate.')
('Melchior', 'Aww... But the party had only just gotten started.<br/>What a bummer...')
('Melchior', "Oh, well. The boss' plan will come to fruition all<br/>the same. He will make sure the whole world is<br/>engulfed in Pandemonium.")
('Melchior', 'Or perhaps you will spread it in his place?')
('Van', '...Hmph.')
('Quatre', 'What a ridiculous notion. Van would never do such<br/>a thing.')
('Agnès', "Exactly. Whatever happens, we'll overcome this<br/>ordeal together.")
('Judith', 'Yep. Just like we always have.')
('Van', 'Damn, guys...')
('Bergard', 'Haha.')
('Melchior', 'How boring. This is no fun at all...')
('Melchior', "Well, whatever. There's no telling what the future has<br/>in store...")
('Melchior', 'I hope it involves all of you suffering the most<br/>gruesome deaths imaginable. I want you all to<br/>succumb to fear...and despair...')
('Van', 'And I want you to shut up and go to hell already.<br/>Oh, and before you do, let me ask you one thing<br/>real quick.')
('Van', 'We got a message from someone by the name of C.<br/>Was that you?')
('Feri', '...Oh?')
('Risette', 'I had nearly forgotten about that.')
('Melchior', "What on earth are you blathering about now?<br/>I didn't—")
('Melchior', 'Wait. C... I wonder...')
('Van', "Wha...? You know somethin'?!")
('Melchior', "Ahaha! As if I'd tell you!")
('Melchior', "I wouldn't want to spoil someone else's surprise, but I<br/>will say that it's not the boss. I'll let your imaginations<br/>run wild from there.")
('Melchior', "Don't trouble your pretty little heads about it, though.<br/>After all, you'll be dead soon enough.")
('Aaron', 'Ugh. Creepy to the bitter end.')
('Aaron', "Wouldn't shock me if he was only pretending to<br/>know the answer. Y'know, just to get a rise out of us.")
('Quatre', "You really think he would do that? ...Actually, that's a<br/>silly question. Of course he would.")
('Judith', "It's very much in character for him.")
('Van', "Either way, we're gonna have to put a pin in the<br/>whole thing with C.")
('Van', "Now that everyone's least favorite nutcase is down, all<br/>we gotta do is take out the mastermind.")
('Van', "And once we've returned the city to normal, life will<br/>all go back to the way it was.")
('Van', "We're almost at the finish line, gang. We just gotta<br/>make one last sprint to the end.")
('Van', "I can see Mr. Prez slidin' us a big, fat paycheck under<br/>the table after all's said and done.")
('Van', "And that'll pay for all the sweets and sauna trips we<br/>could ever want!")
('Aaron', "My dude. Please get some new interests. I'm<br/>begging you.")
('Feri', 'Haha... Still, that sounds super fun!')
('Agnès', "It does. And I'm sure Dad will compensate us.<br/>After all, he did say we could consider this a job<br/>from him.")
('Risette', "Heehee. We're due a proper celebration when this<br/>comes to an end.")
('Bergard', 'Agreed. I suggest we go all out—and aim to make our<br/>gathering the other day look modest by comparison.')
('Judith', 'Yeah! Sounds like the perfect time to crack open<br/>some cold ones.')
('Quatre', "Oh? I didn't take you for a beer drinker. All the ones<br/>I know are old men.")
('Judith', 'Uhh... I mean, we can all get some wine and<br/>champagne together!')
('Feri', "But I'm a minor...")
('Agnès', '...?')
('Van', 'All right. Time for the final stretch.')
('Van', "We've got a Genesis to claim and a Dantès to thrash!")
('Agnès', 'Right!')
('Aaron', "Hell yeah. Let's rock!")
('Van', '...')
('Feri', "Isn't that the song from Dingo's recording?")
('Agnès', "That's right. It's called La Oraciónese. It was a<br/>popular song during the revolution a century ago.")
('Risette', 'I believe they once considered making it the official<br/>national anthem of Calvard.')
('Aaron', 'Yeah, but they decided against it. They went with<br/>Swear on the White Cloves instead.')
('Dantès', 'Mhm...')
('Dantès', 'It is a song about the fall of the nobility and the rise<br/>of the people. In theory, an ideal fit for the freshly<br/>minted revolutionary government.')
('Dantès', 'Alas, there was a hint of a lingering fondness for the<br/>old kingdom in the lyrics.')
('Dantès', "And they couldn't change them because the song was<br/>too well known at that point. So they went with a<br/>different tune.")
('Van', "Hmph. We didn't come here for a history lesson,<br/>you prick.")
('Dantès', 'Perhaps not, but I welcome you all the same, Arkride.<br/>And I will extend my warmest greetings to your<br/>employees and your concierge.')
('Dantès', "It's good to see you as well, Roaring Lion.")
('Bergard', 'I have cast that name aside. You would do well to<br/>forget it.')
('Dantès', "The past is a matter of great import on this particular<br/>occasion, so I'm afraid I can't do that.")
('Dantès', "And I can't forget yours, either...Agnès Gramheart.")
('Dantès', "You may hide under a false name, but you can't pull<br/>the wool over my eyes.")
('Agnès', '...')
('Feri', "Right. That would be your real name, wouldn't it?")
('Aaron', 'Huh. Guess I never really thought about it before.')
('Agnès', "Haha. Yes, I've been using my mother's maiden name<br/>ever since my father took up office.")
('Agnès', "It's what our protection service recommended two<br/>years ago. I've just gotten used to it at this point.")
('Dantès', "I was caught off guard by your father's intervention in<br/>this affair. Though I shouldn't have been surprised.")
('Dantès', "He has always been a man of action. He's quick to<br/>conduct blackmail and other self-serving<br/>political decisions.")
('Dantès', "Haha. That's part of why I believed there was room<br/>for negotiation between us, but that ship has sailed.")
('Judith', "I'm sorry. What?")
('Quatre', 'The president of the Republic would never cut a deal<br/>with a man who wiped out an entire village.')
('Agnès', "Especially when it's his people. My father wouldn't<br/>stoop to your level.")
('Dantès', "I wouldn't be so sure of that if I were you. I've heard<br/>rumors that he entered into an agreement with<br/>the society.")
('Dantès', "But let's put that aside. I shouldn't be driving a wedge<br/>between you and your father. Your relationship with<br/>him is fractured enough as it is.")
('Dantès', 'So we can leave it at that... Though I am curious as to<br/>how he merged the Epstein bloodline with his own.')
('Agnès', '...')
('Van', "Actually, he didn't, really. Her grandmother was<br/>adopted, so she's not a blood relative of Epstein.")
('Van', "You really like gettin' under people's skin,<br/>don'tcha, Dantès?")
('Van', 'Actually, what do we even call you now?<br/>Don Dantès? His Highness Prince Dantès?')
('Van', 'Or High Priest Dantès of the D∴G cult?')
('Dantès', '...')
('Van', "And while we're at it, let me ask you somethin' else.<br/>Back in Oración, it didn't seem like you knew for sure<br/>that I was your target.")
('Van', "But that's changed now, hasn't it? Have you been<br/>waitin' for me specifically all this time?")
('Van', "'Cause from where I'm standing, it looks like all of<br/>this Pandemonium nonsense was just a ploy to draw<br/>me in.")
('Agnès', '...What?')
('Risette', 'Really?')
('Dantès', 'Your arrogance truly astounds me, boy.')
('Dantès', 'Bringing you here was merely one part of my grand<br/>scheme—not the focal point.')
('Dantès', 'My primary goal is—and always was—to create and<br/>spread Pandemonium throughout the world.')
('Dantès', 'My ambitions lie beyond the ruined kingdom and the<br/>fallen cult. Even Almata was simply a means to<br/>an end!')
('Dantès', 'The day I stole this power from you, my very reason<br/>for being changed forever.')
('Dantès', 'I will expose the true form of this nation, as well as<br/>this continent—a world hinged on lies.')
('Dantès', 'And I will do so by taking the form of ultimate fear.')
('Van', '...!')
('Judith', "You're going to do what now? Wait... Hold up.")
('Feri', "What did you mean by, 'The day I stole this power<br/>from you'?")
('Aaron', "You saying you took something of Van's? What for...?")
('Quatre', 'N-No way. Is that what turned the capital into<br/>Pandemonium...with the Genesis as its conduit?!')
('Dantès', 'Hahaha! Precisely!')
('Dantès', 'It all began eleven years ago when I received a curious<br/>report from one of our lodges.')
('Dantès', 'They captured a boy who was born with a demonic<br/>element, and they were attempting to extract it—by<br/>any means necessary.')
('Dantès', "The members of the D∴G cult were out of<br/>their minds. Not that I'm in a position to judge,<br/>of course...")
('Dantès', '...but to them, no idea was taboo. Anything was fair<br/>game as long as it furthered their goal to reject the<br/>existence of the Goddess.')
('Dantès', 'Nevertheless, the vast majority of their misbegotten<br/>schemes came up empty, but on occasion, they would<br/>happen upon a goldmine.')
('Dantès', 'And their crowning achievement was finding the<br/>diabolic core that resided in the boy.')
('Dantès', 'That core possessed unspeakable power. It had no<br/>place within this realm of existence. It was a<br/>forbidden fruit that was ripe for the taking...')
('Dantès', "...so naturally, I seized it. I told them to hand it over,<br/>and they couldn't very well refuse the request of<br/>Calvardian royalty—and their high priest.")
('Dantès', 'Before that day, I had no dreams nor ambitions to<br/>speak of. I led a hollow existence.')
('Dantès', 'But the moment I laid eyes on that core, I instantly<br/>came alive. I was drawn to its radiant beauty, and I<br/>was sucked in by its blackened splendor.')
('Dantès', 'I welcomed it into my body. And then...I was reborn.')
('Dantès', 'Eventually, the cult came under fire by the society,<br/>and then it was nearly annihilated by a large-scale<br/>operation led by a famous bracer.')
('Dantès', 'But I avoided the fate that befell the cult. I escaped<br/>using my newly acquired demonic power.')
('Dantès', "After that, I began my life anew in the mafia.<br/>I deceived Almata's witless leader with ease and put<br/>him to the sword.")
('Dantès', 'Then I gathered minions who would do my bidding,<br/>including Melchior—who hailed from the group that<br/>was birthed by my former abode.')
('Van', '...')
('Agnès', 'Van...')
('Risette', 'I had no idea those lost seven years were filled with so<br/>much trauma...')
('Judith', 'You had a...diabolic core inside you? What even<br/>is that?')
('Aaron', "You knew about this all along, didn't you?")
('Bergard', 'Yes, I did. I assisted with the operation that<br/>eradicated the cult.')
('Bergard', 'During the mission, I chanced upon Van, who had<br/>miraculously survived—yet lost the will to live. I then<br/>treated his physical and mental wounds.')
('Bergard', 'Four years later, our paths crossed once more while he<br/>was wandering aimlessly after dropping out of<br/>school.')
('Van', "Heh. Bet you regret bumpin' into me after all the<br/>trouble I caused you from that point on.")
('Quatre', '...You went through all that, too, Van?')
('Feri', "Huh? 'Too'?")
('Van', "Sorry for not comin' clean about this sooner, Quatre.")
('Van', "You ain't like me, though. You picked yourself back<br/>up and started a new life.")
('Van', "You've even got a family. And a nice one, at that.")
('Quatre', '...')
('Quatre', "You're right. I've got the professor, Essy, and Yang—<br/>who have all helped me get back on my feet.")
('Quatre', 'And there are others in the institute, artisanal district,<br/>and Verne whose shoulders I can lean on. I have<br/>many people whom I treasure dearly.')
('Quatre', "But isn't that the same for you? You have many loved<br/>ones in your life who will support you however<br/>they can.")
('Van', "...Yeah. I'm thankful for all the people who've stuck<br/>by my side.")
('Van', "And I should thank you for the long-winded<br/>exposition, Dantès. Say, have you ever considered a<br/>career in film? You'd make a half-decent narrator.")
('Van', "You're lettin' those badass vocal chords go to waste.<br/>Why don't you ditch this mafia gig and shoot for a<br/>big debut on the big screen?")
('Van', "I'll even set you up with Gotti. Who knows?<br/>Maybe you'll land yourself a starring role in a sexy<br/>romance flick with Judith.")
('Judith', 'Oh, HELL no!')
('Dantès', 'Ridiculous. I can never return to an ordinary life in<br/>this world. Nor do I have any desire to.')
('Dantès', 'All I want is for this meaningless chapter of existence<br/>to draw to a close...')
('Dantès', '...and I will write its end myself. Come<br/>forth, Apeiron!')
('Van', '...!')
('Aaron', 'What the hell is that?!')
('Bergard', 'That sword is covered in ominous miasma...')
('Feri', "I-It's those glyphs again!")
('Judith', "So you've become an undead, too.")
('Risette', 'That can only mean one thing: you definitely<br/>perished that day in the palace.')
('Dantès', "Indeed. And of course, this is not the Empire's curse<br/>at work.")
('Dantès', "In order to unleash the full breadth of the diabolic<br/>core's power, I had to cast aside the shackles<br/>of mortality. So I put my plan into motion.")
('Dantès', 'First, I burned Creil to the ground so that I could set<br/>the stage for the game in Oración. That village made<br/>for the perfect sacrificial lamb.')
('Dantès', 'And like a lamb to the slaughter, you, Arkride—the<br/>owner of this core—heard my call, followed me into<br/>the city, and plunged your sword into my chest.')
('Dantès', 'Thanks to you, I have been reborn as an undead, and<br/>now I wield the power to use the Genesis to unfurl<br/>Pandemonium throughout the land!')
('Feri', "H-How could you?! People's lives aren't just toys for<br/>you to play around with!")
('Agnès', 'You... You killed all those people and crushed their<br/>hopes and dreams for such a stupid, selfish reason?!')
('Judith', 'I thought Melchior was the lowest of the low, but<br/>clearly, I was wrong!')
('Van', "...I'm sorry, Dantès.")
('Dantès', '...What?')
('Van', "I'm guessin' you weren't always quite this twisted.")
('Van', 'You lived a life bound by your birth, and after that,<br/>you were forced to rely on a cult of lunatics—who you<br/>wanted nothing to do with.')
('Van', "...Then your luck went up in smoke, 'cause you<br/>met me. The core inside me changed you forever.")
('Dantès', '...!')
('Van', 'What happened to Creil, Dingo, and those who died<br/>in Oración...')
('Van', '...and even Pandemonium itself...')
('Van', '...all comes back to one troublesome punk.')
('Agnès', "Van, that's not...")
('Aaron', "That's bullshit, and you know it...!")
('Quatre', "This isn't your fault, Van!")
('Dantès', 'The world does not revolve around you, Van Arkride!')
('Dantès', "I have walked this path of my own free will—and<br/>every choice I've made has been mine and mine alone.")
('Dantès', 'How DARE you imply otherwise?')
('Dantès', 'I will not stand to be pitied by the likes of you!')
('Dantès', 'Heheh. Once you finally breathe your last, the final<br/>factor will be unleashed...')
('Dantès', '...and then the diabolic core that dwells within me<br/>will become whole and return to its true form!')
('Dantès', 'At long last, you will finally be mine, empty husk!')
('Feri', 'Not if we have anything to say about it!')
('Aaron', "The crap that's coming outta your mouth is as dumb<br/>as your hair, asshole!")
('Risette', 'We cannot and will not overlook what you are saying<br/>about Mr. Arkride.')
('Agnès', 'You take those words back!')
('Agnès', "I won't stand for you calling Van an empty husk.<br/>He's a wonderful human being. And he's someone<br/>who is dear to us all!")
('Van', '...')
('Van', "Now that I know you're beyond saving, I can take<br/>comfort in finishing you off one last time.")
('Van', "And I'm not just doing that to get my core back. It's a<br/>spriggan's job to take out power-hungry bastards<br/>when no one else can!")
('Dantès', 'Hahaha! How amusing. I look forward to seeing<br/>you try!')
('Risette', 'Is he...resonating with Mr. Arkride...?')
('Bergard', 'So that is the diabolic core...')
('Dantès', 'Hahaha! Looks like my theory proved true! The core<br/>will soon be made whole once again!')
('Dantès', "Though I'm afraid my curiosity is getting the better<br/>of me. I think I will perform an early test run.")
('Van', 'Ugh!')
('Dantès', 'Heheh... Ahahahahahaha!')
('Agnès', '...')
('Feri', 'A malevolent god...')
('Aaron', "Just like the Tyrant... No, this thing's on a whole<br/>other level!")
('Quatre', 'Aaaaah!')
('Judith', 'Wh-What IS this?!')
('Bergard', "Ugh... It's overwhelming, is what it is!")
(61890, 'Not bad. Not bad at all.')
(61890, 'If this is merely a taste of the power I will soon wield,<br/>then I cannot wait to see what I can do once the core<br/>is whole.')
(61890, "Heheh... Even the society's strongest Enforcer will be<br/>nothing more than an ant at my feet.")
(61890, '...Hmm?')
('Van', 'Haaaaaaaaah!')
('Agnès', 'Van!')
('Aaron', 'Are you gonna call on the Grendel?!')
('Risette', 'B-But Mare is not here to assist...')
('Van', "Oh, I don't think she's gone anywhere. She's probably<br/>just slackin' off and takin' a nap.")
('Van', 'Get your ass outta bed, Mare-Bear!')
('Van', "Stop bein' a lazy bum and do your damn job!")
('Mare', "Ugh. You didn't have to make such a racket. And for<br/>the last stinkin' time, stop calling me Mare-Bear.")
('Feri', 'Mare!')
('Judith', 'Sh-She woke up...')
('Mare', "What're you talking about? I was awake this<br/>whole time. I've just been kinda out of it while I was<br/>repairing myself.")
('Mare', "So that's what you're up against. You've come a<br/>long way.")
('Van', "Still can't remember who you really are, but I do<br/>know the role you've always fulfilled.")
('Van', 'So like I said earlier, I need you to do your damn job.')
('Mare', 'Sure, I can do that...but is that really what you want?')
('Van', "Yeah. It's exactly what I want.")
('Agnès', "W-Wait a moment... What're you doing?")
('Quatre', "Did you say 'role'? What does that mean?")
('Judith', 'So pretty...')
('Agnès', 'Van... No...')
(61890, 'Hahaha... I see. It all makes sense now.')
(61890, "Admittedly, I cannot tell whether this is resonance or<br/>Gnosis at work, but either way, I'm quite surprised.")
('Van/Grendel', "Heh. So that's what kinda drug that was. Interesting.")
('Van/Grendel', "Well, whatever. It's about time we wrapped this up.")
('Van/Grendel', "I'm kinda curious to see which of us befits it the most.<br/>How about we go toe to toe and find out?")
(61890, 'Very well! Have it your way!')
(61890, 'I will gladly devour both you and your restraints.<br/>You have sealed your fate, Van Arkride!')
('Van/Grendel', "Nah. You sealed yours when you stole my shit.<br/>And I'm about to take it back!")
(40501, 'AAAAAAAAARGH!')
('Feri', 'D-Did we do it?!')
('Aaron', 'No! Not yet!')
(40511, 'GAAAAAH!')
('Van/Grendel', '*pant* *pant*')
('Agnès', 'Van!')
('Risette', "Thank goodness... It's finally over...")
(40511, 'Hahaha... I was so close...')
(40511, 'Now that I have been parted from that monstrosity, I<br/>finally understand just how abominable it truly is.')
('Van/Grendel', "I'll bet. No human should ever have this thing.")
('Van/Grendel', "But I'm not gonna apologize to you ever again.")
(40511, 'Rightfully so. I have always acted in accordance to my<br/>own way of living—just as you do.')
(40511, 'You may have won this fight, but my ultimate desire<br/>will still be realized—by your hands.')
('Quatre', 'Wha...?!')
('Bergard', 'Oh, no...')
(40511, 'I already know for a fact that Gehenna does not exist.')
(40511, "But I'll still leave you with these parting words:")
(40511, 'I will be watching you from its depths, Van Arkride.')
(40511, "It won't be long...until you become the living<br/>embodiment of fear itself.")
('Judith', 'Wait a second... What did he mean?!')
('Aaron', 'Van! Throw that damn thing away, NOW!')
('Van/Grendel', "Too late. I've got no choice but to return it to where<br/>it belongs.")
('Feri', 'It...vanished?')
('Risette', 'No. It simply returned to Mr. Arkride...')
('Agnès', '...')
('Agnès', '...')
('Van/Grendel', "\u3000 Sorry to spring this on you, Agnès,<br/>but I'm not gonna be able to finish your request.")
('Van/Grendel', " Though I doubt you'll need me. With all of you on the case,<br/>you'll find the last Genesis in no time.")
('Van/Grendel', "\u3000Just to be safe, though, I did draw up a list of<br/>places I think it might be. Hope that'll help.")
