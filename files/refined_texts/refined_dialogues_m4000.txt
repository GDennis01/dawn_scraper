('Feri', "I'm detecting multiple monsters farther inside!")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', 'Tch! Just where did they all come from?')
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "And the timing couldn't have been worse...")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', 'Arkride, was it? And the rest of you, too—you all<br/>strike me as a tough bunch.')
('Chief Engineer Giscard', 'I promise to reward you handsomely, so...save him.<br/>Please.')
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "I'll contact the guild and someone who can help in<br/>the meantime, though, so don't go crazy!")
('Van', "Lucky for us we've got him on our side, huh?<br/>All right, folks—let's get movin'.")
('Agnès', 'Right! We have to save Quatre!')
('Risette', 'Indeed. I heard the faint sound of gunfire<br/>moments ago.')
('Aaron', 'What, is he packing or something? Kinda dangerous<br/>for a kid like him, right?')
('Feri', "Either way, let's hurry!")
('Van', 'Found him!')
('Agnès', 'Qu-Quatre!')
('Feri', "What's that silver thing?")
('FIO', 'Detecting small-scale seismic shift.')
('Quatre', 'Ugh. That thing from before?')
('Quatre', 'Gah! ...Aaah!')
('Van', 'HAAAAAAH!')
('Quatre', '...!')
('Agnès', 'Are you all right?!')
('Quatre', "Agnès? ...You're ALL here...")
('Aaron', "Damn. What'd you just do to neutralize the tremors?")
('Risette', 'He paired the stun caliber and hollow style together<br/>most magnificently.')
('Van', "The timing just happened to work out. It ain't gonna<br/>be happenin' again.")
('Feri', 'A subspecies of the abyss worm! Watch out for their<br/>chain counterattacks!')
('Van', "Use solo skills or arts to take 'em down! Are you good<br/>to go?!")
('Quatre', 'Mgh... Yes, I can still fight!')
('Quatre', 'FIO, be sure to work with them!')
('FIO', 'Understood. Initiating interception protocol!')
('System', 'Found <br/>.')
('Van', 'Was that all of them?')
('Risette', 'I believe that to be the case, yes.')
('Agnès', 'Are you hurt at all, Quatre?')
('Quatre', "I'm fine... I didn't realize you would all come.")
('Quatre', 'Sorry for causing you so much trouble.')
('Aaron', "Ha! 'Trouble' is right. Least you weren't dumb<br/>enough to come here unarmed.")
('Van', 'An orbal pulse gun, eh? And you know your way<br/>around combat from what I saw.')
('Van', 'Same with this floating thing, too.')
('FIO', 'Floating thing?')
('Feri', 'Wow...')
('Agnès', "It's adorable...")
('Quatre', 'Haha, you think? This little guy is named FIO.')
('Van', "Much as I'd love to hear more, you mind if we shift<br/>to talking about what happened?")
('Van', "I'd heard there aren't supposed to be monsters<br/>in here. You were checkin' the lights, right?")
('Quatre', 'Well...')
('Aaron', "That's weird...")
('Feri', 'Were they damaged?')
('Quatre', 'No. They were just swapped out the other day.')
('Quatre', 'Plus...')
('Van', "It's not just that one that's gone bad. It's happening to<br/>all of 'em along the tunnel.")
('Agnès', "...You're right.")
('Risette', "These are self-sufficient lights, so they aren't on the<br/>orbal distribution network.")
('Quatre', 'Exactly—which means this kind of behavior should<br/>be impossible.')
('Quatre', 'So why—')
('Van', 'Get back here!')
('Quatre', 'Guh!')
('Aaron', "There's more of 'em?!")
('Risette', "This isn't good. Everyone, prepare for combat!")
('Van', 'Tch!')
('Feri', 'Van!')
('XEROS', 'RUFF!')
('Van', '...?!')
('Quatre', 'XEROS!')
('Bracer Regina', 'Now, Alvis!')
('Bracer Alvis', 'HAAAH!')
('Bracer Alvis', 'Does anyone here need medical attention?')
('Agnès', 'Did you come all the way from the capital?')
('Van', 'Heh. Nice heroic entrance there, junior-senior bracer.')
('Bracer Alvis', 'Hmph. Well, YOU seem fine.')
('Quatre', 'Thanks for rushing over here, XEROS.')
('XEROS', 'RUFF.')
('Feri', 'Whoa! A black wolf?!')
('Aaron', "It's starting to feel like just about anything could pop<br/>up around here.")
('Risette', "(I see. So that's what is being tested here...)")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', 'Are all of you okay?!')
('Quatre', 'Supervisor...')
('Van', 'Phew. Guess that wraps up this little adventure, then.')
('Quatre', "I-I'm okay now! You can let go!")
('Quatre', 'I believe this is the innermost depths of the<br/>sealed area.')
('Quatre', 'Take a look at the surface of that boulder in<br/>the back.')
('Agnès', "It's glowing... It must be Zemuria Moss.")
('Feri', 'It looks so mysterious...')
('Aaron', "All right, let's grab some!")
('Van', 'Actually, before that—')
('Risette', "It's approaching from above! Be careful!")
('Quatre', 'This pressure... We must be invading its territory.')
('Van', "Yeah. Stay focused, people! We're driving it back!")
('Quatre', "Phew. I'm glad that worked out.")
('Risette', 'Very nice work, everyone.')
('Van', 'Time to grab the goods.')
('System', 'Obtained Zemuria Moss.')
('Agnès', 'So this is Zemuria Moss? Its pale glow makes it quite<br/>the mysterious plant.')
('Aaron', "I bet this'd go for a shitton of mira if we grabbed 'em<br/>by the root.")
('Quatre', "They're important research materials, so please only<br/>take what you need.")
('Aaron', 'Heh. Just messing around.')
('Feri', 'Pretty sure you were at least half serious.')
('Van', "Eh, not like I don't get where he's comin' from.")
('Van', "Anyway, that's that job done. Let's get back to the<br/>research lab.")
('System', 'Obtained Zemuria Moss.')
('System', 'Unlocked the door to the sealed area.')
('Van', 'Great. Now we can keep moving.')
('Quatre', "Right. Let's make our way to the innermost depths<br/>for the Zemuria Moss!")
