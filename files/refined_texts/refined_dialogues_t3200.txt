('Heidi', "I wouldn't have made it out of there if not for you...<br/>I can't thank you enough.")
('Heidi', "I was really surprised to see how strong<br/>Quatre's gotten. He's really grown up, hasn't he?")
('Heidi', "I'm sure Professor Hamilton will be happy to see that,<br/>if and when she returns.")
('Heidi', 'Yesterday was just awful... They even went after old<br/>Stinson, from what I heard. Those machines nearly<br/>killed him...')
('Heidi', "We made it out in the nick of time, but...I just can't<br/>help worry about the future now. I don't feel<br/>safe anymore...")
('Heidi', "Professor Callaghan's undeniably smart, but all the<br/>same, he has a bad habit of panicking and rushing<br/>into bad decisions.")
('Heidi', "That's always been his weak point, really: he has<br/>trouble stepping back and clearing his head.")
('Heidi', "Professor Hamilton is an inspiration to us all, but...it's<br/>kind of strange. She doesn't feel distant or<br/>unapproachable at all.")
('Heidi', "She's kind and cheerful, despite her stature. Even the<br/>more crotchety artisans can't help but respect her.")
('Heidi', "I just worry about her sometimes. She's very<br/>determined, very headstrong, and that does<br/>sometimes put her at odds with others.")
('Heidi', 'Young Quatre looks up to her an awful lot. He may<br/>very well grow up to be just like her.')
('Heidi', "Quatre's been awfully busy these days, hasn't he? I do<br/>hope he's keeping well.")
('Heidi', "I know the professor isn't around anymore, but<br/>Giscard and plenty of others are still around to help<br/>him out.")
('Heidi', "But he's still feeling uneasy about things, regardless...")
('Heidi', 'Ah, are you showing those good people around the<br/>city, too?')
('Heidi', 'I thought I saw you with a different group of<br/>students earlier.')
('Quatre', "That's right. These guys have some business at the<br/>institute themselves.")
('Quatre', "They lent me a hand when I ran into some trouble<br/>earlier, so I figured I'd thank them.")
('Heidi', "I see, I see. Well, that sounds good. You just look so<br/>busy lately, it's hard not to worry about you.")
('Heidi', "I hear the whole institute is busier than ever.<br/>Everyone's been gray under the eyes as of late.")
('Quatre', "I appreciate your concern, but I'm fine, really. I know<br/>my limits, and I'm making sure not to overstep them.")
('Heidi', "Well, if you're sure... Just take care of yourself,<br/>all right?")
('Heidi', "You wouldn't want to burn yourself out, especially at<br/>your age. Professor Hamilton would hate to hear that.")
('Van', "(Huh. Quatre's really hot shit.)")
('Van', "(Makes me wonder all the more why the CEO's<br/>actin' like he is. And the institute's rubbin' me the<br/>wrong way, too.)")
('Heidi', "How time flies. You've really come into your<br/>own, Quatre.")
('Heidi', "I think the Professor will be quite shocked to see how<br/>much you've grown!")
('Boss Grover', "Well, I'll be damned... Guess my son really did care<br/>about the workshop.")
('Boss Grover', "I just never could figure out what he was thinking—<br/>he's got trouble opening up like that. He gets that<br/>from me...")
('Boss Grover', "Man. I sat down with my son last night, but we still<br/>couldn't really see eye to eye on things. I can't figure<br/>out kids worth a damn.")
('Boss Grover', 'I just wanna help him figure out what path he wants<br/>to take in life. The workshop will let him find what<br/>works for him.')
('Boss Grover', "But I can never get that through to him... Maybe I'm<br/>just not good at explaining it.")
('Boss Grover', "Long day... I've had my son on my mind. I wanna<br/>talk to him when I get home, but what do I even say?")
('Boss Grover', "He's studying over at the Institute of Science these<br/>days, but we couldn't disagree more on engineering.")
('Boss Grover', "He's big on innovating—finding the new big thing.<br/>But me, I'm a more traditional guy. I take pride in the<br/>family art I've inherited.")
('Boss Grover', "I'm not trying to pressure him into taking over the<br/>shop, but I think he's hearing me that way. It's a<br/>puzzle, I tell ya...")
('Boss Grover', 'I do remember hearing there was some falling-out<br/>between two professors over at the institute.')
('Boss Grover', "One of them was a disciple of Hamilton's, they<br/>were saying.")
('Boss Grover', "Wish I could tell you more, but that's all I remember.<br/>Sorry.")
('Boss Grover', 'Word on the street is, Giscard landed another<br/>big project.')
('Boss Grover', "Ol' Giscard heads up the Artisans' Guild. As a fellow<br/>member, I'm proud to have him as our ambassador.")
('Boss Grover', "I'm happy to be where I am, but Giscard didn't get<br/>where he is by settling. I gotta keep moving up in the<br/>world, just like him.")
('Boss Grover', "I specialize in pressure equipment, and that's a big<br/>niche nowadays. Only gonna get bigger, my gut says.")
('Boss Grover', "My son got into the institute, he's studying<br/>there now. I'm really proud of him for that... I just<br/>wish we could get along a little better.")
('Boss Grover', "He's really into the cutting-edge tech, like the stuff<br/>they're researching over there. And y'know, that's all<br/>well and good...")
('Boss Grover', "...but theoretical's tougher than applied, you get me?<br/>Funding is super cutthroat. He's gotta be careful, or<br/>he'll just be spinning his wheels.")
('Risette', "(He mentioned that he's a member of the Artisans'<br/>Guild—he might have some dealings with the<br/>institute himself.)")
('Van', "(Yeah. Guessin' it'll be easier to get info out of him<br/>than somebody higher up the food chain.)")
('Lucas', "I really am glad the workshop's okay, but I'm happier<br/>to see you safe. We can replace parts, but...I can't<br/>replace my dad.")
('Boss Grover', "You, too. We got each other, and that's<br/>what's important. Didn't expect you to care that<br/>much about the shop, though!")
('Boss Grover', "Honestly thought you were gonna come by and say,<br/>'Now's the perfect chance to revamp the shop floor!'<br/>Heh.")
('Lucas', 'I... Seriously, would I do that...?')
('Lucas', "I don't hate you like that, c'mon. You're my dad.")
('Boss Grover', "Haha. Yeah, sorry, that was a bit mean of me. I know<br/>you're not like that.")
('Boss Grover', "I'm really happy that you're all right—especially since<br/>I hear the institute got all torn up.")
('Lucas', "I... Admittedly, I didn't think you would care much<br/>for the institute yourself.")
('Boss Grover', "Of course I do, bud. You've got every right to choose<br/>your path in life—doesn't matter if I agree with it<br/>or not.")
('Boss Grover', "If you're gonna be out of class for a while, though, it<br/>might be worth it to stop by and shadow us at the<br/>shop for a bit.")
('Boss Grover', 'Gotta learn algebra before you do calculus—gotta learn<br/>the old stuff before you do the new, right?')
('Lucas', "I mean, I guess I could... Wait a minute, you're<br/>tricking me.")
('Deliveryman Jason', "Whew... Feels like a weight's off my chest, now that<br/>I've told you about the truck.")
('Deliveryman Jason', 'Just saying it out loud made me realize how silly<br/>it was. A car with no driver? Yeah, right.')
('Deliveryman Jason', "Maybe it's just my old noggin playing tricks on me.<br/>I think I'mma clock out and hit the hay early!")
('Deliveryman Jason', 'I just did a delivery run to get some repair materials<br/>where they were needed in the city.')
('Deliveryman Jason', "I'm really glad my truck didn't get dinged up. I can<br/>use it to help everybody out here.")
('Deliveryman Jason', 'Whatever folks need, I can load it up and haul it over.')
('Deliveryman Jason', 'I just got back from a delivery to the institute, but it<br/>sounds like something big went down there now.<br/>The heck did I miss?')
('Deliveryman Jason', "It was in the special research building, I heard.<br/>Average Joes aren't even allowed in there...")
('Deliveryman Jason', "I don't wanna be a thorn in their side while they're<br/>dealing with all that. What's a delivery boy to do?")
('Deliveryman Jason', "Guess I'll just have to sit tight for now, maybe get the<br/>supplies to someone in charge.")
('Deliveryman Jason', "I'm finally done for the day! Gonna grab a bite to eat<br/>and then veg out for the evening.")
('Deliveryman Jason', 'The machinery I see these days is absolutely nuts.<br/>How do they manage it all?')
('Deliveryman Jason', "Transmitters, processors, storage devices—you name<br/>it, I've seen it, they've got it.")
('Deliveryman Jason', "I can feel myself getting older just looking at them.<br/>The world's moving too fast for me, I swear.")
('Deliveryman Jason', 'Whew! Technology, huh? We have to handle all<br/>kinds of gizmos and doodads these days.')
('Deliveryman Jason', "I couldn't tell you what half of these even do, but we<br/>make sure to treat 'em with care all the same.")
('Deliveryman Jason', "Usually we end up delivering them by hand—when<br/>you put 'em in a truck, they slide and they bang<br/>around, and that's not good.")
('Barnaby', 'Hey, thanks for the help yesterday. I never imagined<br/>something like that would happen on the job...<br/>Goddess almighty.')
('Barnaby', 'And I was in such a good mood, too. I was getting<br/>along with the artisans, job was going smooth... Man.')
('Barnaby', 'Trouble really strikes when you least expect it, huh?')
('Barnaby', "I'm just happy I was able to help that lady. It helps<br/>me sleep at night, knowing I did what I could.")
('Barnaby', "I was just starting to get along with those artisans...<br/>Some of 'em didn't make it out. I feel sick...")
('Barnaby', 'I wanna at least help get the Artisanal District back<br/>on its feet. There has to be something I can do...')
('Barnaby', "We've got fires to put out at our company, but maybe<br/>I could convince the higher ups to chip in with the<br/>repairs around town.")
('Barnaby', 'Bleh. I had way too much to drink last night...but it<br/>was a decent chance to shoot the shit with the<br/>artisans, at least.')
('Barnaby', "They're a lot more relatable than I first thought.<br/>They take a lot of pride in doing their job right, just<br/>like I do.")
('Barnaby', "I'm supposed to be the middleman between them and<br/>the higher ups, but looking back, I've just been<br/>pushing the higher ups' agenda onto them...")
('Barnaby', "I gotta start listening to their side of the<br/>story, y'know? Maybe they can do their job better<br/>that way.")
('Barnaby', "Mrrgh... I get it's a tough job, I really do!")
('Barnaby', "But damn it, what am I supposed to tell my bosses?<br/>It's THEIR deadlines and production quotas we're<br/>working with!")
(15291, "Oh, we've seen you around once or twice. You're that<br/>project owner, right?")
(15291, "You've got it rough, too, huh? Y'know, I'm thinking<br/>maybe we could vent a bit tonight.")
(15292, "Maybe it'll be easier for you to talk about your stuff<br/>outside your usual crowd.")
('Barnaby', "You guys're...")
('Barnaby', "...Yeah. Look, I hate how I'm always forcing you to<br/>do this and stick to that. I hate telling you how to do<br/>your job.")
('Barnaby', "I don't wanna make you bend over backward any<br/>more than you wanna hear it...")
('Barnaby', "...but I can't say no to the higher ups, you know that.<br/>What they say goes.")
(15292, "Nah, we hear ya. It's not like we have free rein over<br/>our work either.")
(15292, 'I remember getting earfuls from my supervisor all the<br/>time when I started out, always telling me to do this<br/>differently or do that better.')
(15291, "We've all been there, bud. We don't hold it<br/>against you.")
(15291, "You're just trying to put food on the table like<br/>everybody else.")
(15292, "Bureaucracy is just part of the business. The bigger<br/>you try to be, the more it'll drag you down.")
('Barnaby', '*sniffle* You... You really mean it?')
('Barnaby', "I... I had you guys wrong this whole time. I'm<br/>sorry, man...")
('Barnaby', 'You mind...having a few more rounds with me?')
(15291, 'Sure thing, buddy. Nothing calms me down like a<br/>glass of the cold stuff!')
('Barnaby', 'All this time, I thought the artisans had a one-track<br/>mind—just stubborn old mules going on and on<br/>about their craft.')
('Barnaby', "But...my bosses are the same, thinking about it. It's all<br/>profit margins and productivity quotas with them.")
('Barnaby', 'Verne works real closely with the Institute of Science.')
('Barnaby', 'So yeah, it makes sense that squabbles between the<br/>two would trickle down to the professors like that.')
('Barnaby', "Whew... It's not easy working in product, let me<br/>tell you. Mediating between factories and artisans is<br/>stressful work.")
('Barnaby', 'Now the artisans are saying they want to delay<br/>everything so they can do just these tiiiny tweaks to<br/>the product before it goes on the line.')
('Barnaby', "I don't get it. Why do they care so much about that<br/>extra 1%? It's good enough as is.")
('Van', '(This guy works in product procurement, huh?)')
('Van', "(Don't think he's workin' for the institute, but he<br/>might know a thing or two about 'em. Wouldn't hurt<br/>to ask.)")
('Researcher Ray', "Right, now that I've got my luggage squared away, I<br/>might want to pay a visit to Verne's HQ on behalf of<br/>the tech union...")
('Researcher Ray', "...but, I dunno. It's a bit late to just drop<br/>by unannounced. I could've gotten here earlier if they<br/>actually had direct trains to Basel...")
('Researcher Ray', "But, ehh, not a big deal. I'm here for botany first and<br/>business second. Verne can wait.")
('Researcher Ray', "I'll have to tour the city while I'm here, too—I mean,<br/>I'm in the scientific melting pot of the country!<br/>You don't get that chance every day.")
('Van', "(Guessin' he's some scientist from abroad?<br/>'Tech union' rings a bell... Where've I heard<br/>that before?)")
('Researcher Ray', "It's a touch disappointing to see my one and only<br/>vegetable recipe hasn't really caught on here<br/>in Calvard.")
('Researcher Ray', "It's all over Crossbell and Erebonia, but it's yet to<br/>track east, I see.")
('Researcher Ray', 'Maybe I can spread the good word at the<br/>institute, though.')
('Researcher Ray', "Those science-y types know good work when they<br/>see it. They're sure to see its greatness!")
('Boss Gowland', "We're gonna have our hands full for a while with<br/>cleanup and rebuilding.")
('Boss Gowland', "Voyager's really impressed me. He's always rushing<br/>into things, but he really had a good grasp on things<br/>this time.")
('Boss Gowland', "Maybe it's about time I gave him a little more<br/>freedom at the shop. I'll have to think about that once<br/>all this is over.")
('Boss Gowland', "Voyager's optimism is probably his biggest strength.<br/>He always looks on the bright side of things.")
('Boss Gowland', 'He just has a habit of rushing headfirst into<br/>everything—makes for sloppy work sometimes.')
('Boss Gowland', "I wouldn't be so opposed to letting him work on his<br/>own if he could show me that he actually knows what<br/>he's doing.")
('Boss Gowland', "These grid issues are getting even worse... It's really<br/>starting to bug me.")
('Boss Gowland', "I took a look around the city, just to make sure it<br/>wasn't some kinda wiring issue.")
('Boss Gowland', "Sure enough, it isn't. No fraying, no deformation,<br/>no nothing. Whatever the problem is, it's not<br/>something new parts would fix.")
('Boss Gowland', 'Orbments have developed a lot, but at the end of the<br/>day, they still run on mechanical gears and hinges,<br/>just like any other machine.')
('Boss Gowland', "That's good news for us metalworkers—we're the<br/>backbone of the whole orbment industry. We'll have<br/>steady work for decades, I'm thinking.")
('Boss Gowland', "The more moving parts you've got in a machine, the<br/>more likely one of them will break.")
('Voyager', "You really got to work with Giscard as a<br/>parts supplier?! That's amazing!")
('Voyager', "Oh, man, I can't believe I get to be your student!")
('Boss Gowland', 'Hah. Yup, sure did. They had me working on the<br/>joints—they needed parts precise down to<br/>the microrege.')
('Boss Gowland', "Our factory's already famous for casting and lathing,<br/>but I'm still honored that they picked us for the task<br/>over the other shops.")
('Voyager', "I'll say! That's so cool! Just, I'm kinda bummed that<br/>I'm only hearing about it now.")
('Voyager', "I hope I get to work on big projects like<br/>that someday! When's my big chance gonna<br/>come around?")
('Boss Gowland', "Y'know, that's a good goal, but I don't think you're<br/>ready for that just yet. You have this habit of ditching<br/>your work before it's polished.")
('Boss Gowland', "You gotta look where you're walking, y'know?<br/>You look too far ahead and you'll trip over yourself.")
('Voyager', 'Thanks so much for letting me come along on<br/>this delivery!')
('Voyager', "Ooh, whoa! Is that the top secret project over there?!<br/>That's so cool...!")
('Boss Gowland', "Easy, boy. You're like a big ol' puppy.")
('Boss Gowland', "Even the small stuff on this job is serious<br/>business, y'know? We gotta make sure we do every<br/>step right.")
('Boss Gowland', "I'd just feel nervous slottin' you in on a big project like<br/>that already.")
('Voyager', "So, if I can stop making you nervous, you'll let me on?<br/>I just gotta get better, right?!")
('Boss Gowland', "*sigh* I guess that's not the WRONG way to take<br/>what I said.")
('Boss Gowland', 'Just, start looking before you leap. You gotta stop<br/>charging blindly into things, bud.')
('Boss Gowland', 'I was looking around the workshop for spare bolts for<br/>the generator, and I stumbled upon this.')
('Boss Gowland', 'Voyager, did you make this?')
('Voyager', "Uh-huh! Everyone's working their butts off, so it<br/>didn't feel fair for me to just sit around.")
('Voyager', "So I had a go at making one of these while you<br/>were out. I...didn't screw it up, did I?")
('Boss Gowland', 'Well, actually, no. This is pretty well polished<br/>compared to your other stuff. I can tell you actually<br/>took your time on it.')
('Boss Gowland', 'You really can do it if you try, huh? Guess the<br/>circumstances brought that out in you, heh.')
('Voyager', 'He... He COMPLIMENTED me! YES! Oh, yeah!')
('Voyager', 'See, yeah, I CAN do it when I try! Maybe if you<br/>could let those project managers know, I can—')
('Boss Gowland', 'Make thirty more of these by EOD.')
('Boss Gowland', "It's good practice, and hey, it'll really help us out if we<br/>can get some more of these.")
('Voyager', 'Aaaaagh! *sigh* I knew it was too good to be true...!')
('Voyager', 'The road to artisanship is long indeed...')
('Voyager', "But now I've got a goal, and I'm sticking to it!<br/>Nothing's gonna stop me!")
('Voyager', 'I feel like it really helped that I was doing it on my<br/>own, though...')
('Voyager', "I'm not sure I can make them as well if I've got him<br/>yelling in my ears.")
('Voyager', "*sigh* I'm really dying to take part in that project.<br/>I gotta hurry up and get smithing.")
('Voyager', "The boss really doesn't like my work, though...")
('Voyager', "I do kinda feel like I'm rushing things, but...how<br/>can't I? He's always yelling in the background. It puts<br/>me on edge.")
('Voyager', "Maybe there's a time or place where it's nice<br/>and quiet. I'll try and make some stuff then.")
('Voyager', "We've been having some power issues lately, so my<br/>boss told me to look into it.")
('Voyager', 'I thought it might be a problem with the wiring here<br/>at the shop, but nope, everything looks fine on<br/>our end.')
('Voyager', "It's really stumping me. What's going on...?")
('Voyager', "My boss' strength is precision—he can cast metal<br/>parts even more precisely than machine<br/>metalworks can.")
('Voyager', 'I really hope I can make stuff as good as he<br/>does, someday.')
('Voyager', "And man, have you heard about the projects he's on?<br/>He gets to work on these awesome machines! It's<br/>so cool!")
('Stinson', "Oh, you're the youngsters from yesterday—and I see<br/>Quatre's with you, too. I can't thank you enough for<br/>helping me.")
('Stinson', "I'd gotten word of people using those kinds of<br/>machine monsters to attack people...but I never<br/>expected to run afoul of one here.")
('Stinson', "But I'm not gonna sit around and mope. Long as I've<br/>still got my arms and legs, I'm gonna do what I can to<br/>help clean up.")
('Stinson', "I may be retired, but I was a damn fine artisan in<br/>my heyday. I'll make myself useful somehow.")
('Stinson', "I'm lucky to be alive after all that...")
('Stinson', "I might not've made it, if those students from the<br/>capital didn't help me out. I owe them my life.")
('Stinson', "Long as my heart's still beatin', I'm gonna do what I<br/>can to help. I owe it to them and the city.")
('Stinson', "I may be an old dog, but I've still got my old tricks<br/>from my artisan career. I can handle a repair job<br/>or three.")
('Stinson', "Technology's really takin' off...but it's always because<br/>of violence that it leaps like that. The road to progress<br/>is paved in blood.")
('Stinson', 'Crossbell last year was proof of that. Never seen<br/>anything like it in all my years...')
('Stinson', "I heard Callaghan was workin' like a man possessed<br/>in the days before he went missing. I can only wonder<br/>what he was workin' on.")
('Stinson', "There's just somethin' about his disappearance that<br/>gives me déjà vu. I got a real bad feeling...")
('Stinson', 'I was an artisan here up until about 10 years ago, and<br/>in that time, I saw the whole world evolve around me.')
('Stinson', "From big machines to tiny little orbments, life has<br/>changed a ton—for the better, I'd say. We live a lot<br/>easier than we used to...")
('Stinson', '...but we fight harder, too. Warships, railway guns,<br/>those Panzer Soldats...')
('Stinson', "I worry that one of these days, we'll make somethin'<br/>truly terrible—somethin' that'll doom us all.")
('Stinson', "Are you showin' these folks around, Quatre?")
('Quatre', "That's right. They're conducting an<br/>investigation here.")
('Quatre', 'One of them is also a student here on an<br/>educational visitation.')
('Stinson', "An investigation, you say? Wouldn't have anything to<br/>do with these orbment issues as of late, would it?")
('Stinson', "They weren't contracted by a Verne company or a<br/>workshop, were they? I can't imagine Tausend asking<br/>for outside help.")
('Stinson', "I'm guessing it was either one of those, or maybe a<br/>Verne shareholder acting alone.")
('Van', '(Smart cookie. Used to be an artisan, if I had<br/>to guess.)')
('Van', "(Sounds like he's learned a lot about the inner<br/>workings from his years on the job.)")
('Stinson', "Well, if there's anything I can help with, don't be<br/>afraid to ask. The Artisanal District's always happy to<br/>lend you a hand.")
('Stinson', "We know how much you go through, and how much<br/>responsibility you've got on your shoulders—and<br/>you're only fifteen, to boot.")
('Stinson', "I've been hearin' that a lot of places in town are havin'<br/>problems with the grid.")
('Stinson', "Never had that back in my day—'cause there WAS<br/>no grid, of course. Goes to show, the more you rely<br/>on tech, the more it can let you down.")
('Millia', "Dad says he's heading out to help with the repairs.<br/>Everyone here in the workshop is really busy now...")
('Millia', "There's gotta be something I can do to help... Oh!<br/>Maybe there's some computer work that needs doing?<br/>I'm good with those.")
('Millia', "I can't do backend stuff, but I might be able to help<br/>with like, setup, diagnosing network problems...<br/>It's worth a shot!")
('Millia', "I'm really glad I was able to help out Dad today.<br/>I wanna start pulling my own weight!")
('Millia', "I used to just do grocery runs when people would<br/>need it, but now they're busier than ever. They really<br/>appreciate it now!")
('Millia', "They really look busy today, too. Hmm... Oh, maybe<br/>I should try making them lunch someday! I think<br/>they'd like that.")
('Millia', "You're a really great driver! You handled my Ingert<br/>like it was nothing.")
('Millia', "I wish I could drive like you... I'll just have to keep<br/>at it!")
('Millia', "I gotta keep practicing against Dick. I can't let my<br/>driving skills get rusty!")
('Millia', 'Phew... Those errands took a lot longer than I<br/>thought they would.')
('Millia', "I think I'll rest up a bit before I go see Dad—he<br/>works at a shop floor here in the Artisanal District.<br/>I'd say I've earned the break!")
('Willy', 'I love taking in the breeze here at night... Calms<br/>me down.')
('Willy', "I don't make a point of coming out here regularly,<br/>though—I just make the trip whenever my heart<br/>wants to.")
('Willy', "There's this professor at the institute who comes by<br/>here—and I swear, he's always a step ahead of me.")
('Willy', "I sorta wander around a lot, without really thinking<br/>about where I'm going...so how does he always know<br/>where I end up?")
('Dick', "Hmph. Well, good to see Millia's okay. I wouldn't<br/>want my rival getting injured.")
('Dick', "There's no point in kicking someone while they're<br/>down, you know? I wanna beat her at her best!")
('Dick', "Once the town's back to normal, you bet your butt<br/>I'm challenging her to another race. One-on-one<br/>this time!")
('Dick', 'Thanks so much for the help earlier! Racing is just<br/>the best.')
('Dick', 'I picked up a lotta good pointers, so I should level up<br/>as a racer soon.')
('Dick', "Next time, I'm taking Millia down all on my own!<br/>Just you watch!")
('Lucas', "I thought my dad was against my career path all this<br/>time, but...evidently not. He sounds like he's<br/>accepted it.")
('Lucas', "I swear, it's so hard to tell what's on his mind...")
('Lucas', "Still, I guess it's better to have it sorted out later<br/>than never. Maybe some good came out of this<br/>after all.")
('Odette', "The Artisanal District has this unique vibe to it—it's<br/>so unlike the rest of the city. It's really charming!")
('Odette', "I just wish there weren't so many stairs here...")
('Odette', "It's fine when you can use the aerotram to get around,<br/>but when you can't? Ugh... It's a nightmare.")
('Odette', 'I get why, but still! Could they NOT have built this<br/>city in the middle of a ravine?')
('Agnès', 'Ah, haha... I imagine getting around town was even<br/>more difficult before cars and trams.')
('Albert', "Hmm... Yeah, I can see how this workshop ended up<br/>the flagbearer for the whole Artisans' Guild.")
('Albert', "Each of the other workshops we've visited specializes<br/>in their own little niche instead of covering all<br/>the bases.")
('Albert', "It's all of them working together that makes Verne<br/>the powerhouse that it is—and the city along with it.")
('Aaron', "(Real big on tech, isn't he? Heh, nerd.)")
('Agnès', "(Yeah, he's always had an eye for these things.)")
('Quatre', "(As a native of Basel, I'm happy to see people learn<br/>about what makes this place so nice.)")
('Aaron', "Well, I guess staying home and taking the job off isn't<br/>so bad. Lets me do what I want without a certain<br/>killjoy breathing down my neck.")
('Aaron', 'Might be nice to crack open a cold one downstairs.')
('Aaron', 'If you need me for anything, just gimme a call.')
('Feri', "It's kind of a bummer I can't explore the city at night<br/>with you, because that sounds really cool...")
('Feri', "...but I'll stay here and leave it to you guys.<br/>Lemme know if you find anything, okay?")
('Grani', 'Man alive... We had enough problems to deal with<br/>BEFORE the whole city came under attack.')
('Grani', "I heard that a lot of tourists are stranded here since<br/>they closed all the roads out. They can't get<br/>back home.")
('Grani', 'We have to figure something out for them.<br/>They need a place to stay and food to eat!')
('Grani', 'Some of our guests have been talking about Giscard<br/>landing some big new project.')
('Grani', "It's a common story nowadays. There's lots of<br/>demand for research now, and that's good for spirits<br/>and business both.")
('Grani', "I like to think we've been helping them along in our<br/>own way. Now we've gotta step up our game, with<br/>their projects ramping up. They gotta eat!")
('Grani', "It makes me all the more glad I got my brother to<br/>develop that online ordering system. It's a<br/>real life-saver.")
('Grani', "As you can see, this place is popular with artisans<br/>once they're off the clock.")
('Grani', 'They all come in looking exhausted. No wonder they<br/>need pick-me-ups for tomorrow.')
('Grani', 'The previous owner would always take care of them<br/>really well. He always knew what they needed.')
('Grani', "I hope I'm doing the same for them.")
('Grani', 'Thanks for stopping by earlier! I hope you enjoyed<br/>that engadin—I really put my all into it!')
('Grani', 'My brother works the register and handles the inn<br/>guests, so I get to focus on the food.')
('Grani', "I'm really glad it worked out like that. I can't stand<br/>that clerical stuff, but cooking? That's what I like!")
('Grani', "I mean, we all have things we're good at and things<br/>we're not. It's plain to see here in the<br/>Artisanal District.")
('Grani', "Working here in the bar just happens to be my niche.<br/>I'm happy I'm getting better as a cook because of it!")
('Gillies', "My sister's really fired up—she's been coordinating<br/>food and shelter for those stranded tourists. I can't<br/>blame her.")
('Gillies', "Normally I'd be worried about chewing through our<br/>budget and ingredients, but desperate times, and all.")
('Gillies', "Our phones and stuff are back online, at least, so I'm<br/>gonna need to send out some calls to get everything<br/>squared away.")
('Gillies', "Everyone's just doing what they can right now—and<br/>so should I.")
('Gillies', 'One of our guests was saying that our network issues<br/>have gotten even worse over the last day or so.')
('Gillies', 'Some people are just going off the grid altogether and<br/>staying offline until it all blows over.')
('Gillies', "Ironically, our online ordering system is a bit more<br/>stable now. I guess there's less demand on the grid<br/>or something?")
('Gillies', "The whole city's been having these weird network<br/>issues lately.")
('Gillies', 'Our online ordering system is bugging out, too. I was<br/>in a panic the first time it happened, heh.')
('Gillies', "I thought I'd messed up a line of code or<br/>something—and if I DID, my sister would've had<br/>my head.")
('Gillies', "Thankfully it wasn't me, but it's still a problem.<br/>I'll have to see if I can reduce the server load at all,<br/>maybe that'd help.")
('Gillies', "My sister told me that she'll hold down the bar, and I<br/>can do all the other stuff in exchange.")
('Gillies', "Honestly, though, I feel like I'm doing the lion's share<br/>of the work. She dumps everything on me.")
('Gillies', 'And now I have to manage this delivery system she<br/>just cooked up on a whim last month.')
('Gillies', "I'm in charge of helping out guests outside the bar, so<br/>lemme know if there's anything I can help you with.")
('Gillies', "I just wasn't figuring I'd have to do all the online<br/>order work, too...")
('Gillies', "We have a dedicated delivery guy now, at least—and<br/>the online ordering system is up and running, too, so<br/>it's a lot more manageable now.")
('Deliveryman Marco', "The whole city's fallen on hard times, so we gotta<br/>help however we can.")
('Deliveryman Marco', "I'm just a part-timer, but I feel like I really am<br/>making a difference. I like seeing people's faces light<br/>up when their food arrives.")
('Deliveryman Marco', 'The food here is really good, so it should be a nice<br/>pick-me-up for the people out there who need it.')
('Deliveryman Marco', "Whew... Even on a slow day, I'm running all<br/>across town. Crazy to think this isn't even close<br/>to peak.")
('Deliveryman Marco', "Gillies says the online service is glitching out for some<br/>reason, so we're not getting as many delivery<br/>orders today.")
('Deliveryman Marco', "Just goes to show how many people are using it.<br/>Now that it's bugging out, the whole system's<br/>backed up.")
('Deliveryman Marco', "I'm almost done with today's deliveries. Looks like I'll<br/>be putting in overtime, though—lotta late dinner<br/>orders today.")
('Deliveryman Marco', "Once I'm done with work, I can finally get my OWN<br/>dinner...and then it's off to bed to get ready<br/>for tomorrow. Lather, rinse, repeat, eh?")
('Deliveryman Marco', "Grani always cooks for me at the end of the day.<br/>I really appreciate it... She's such a good person, man.")
('Deliveryman Marco', "All right, I've picked up all the lunch orders—now to<br/>deliver them!")
('Deliveryman Marco', 'A lot of the artisans have this habit of getting so<br/>caught up in work that they forget to eat.')
('Deliveryman Marco', "So the inn decided to start up this delivery service<br/>last month. That way, they don't accidentally<br/>go hungry!")
('Deliveryman Marco', 'It was just the right time for me, actually—I was<br/>trying to find a job, and then the inn<br/>came a-knocking. Worked out perfectly!')
('Lawrence', 'I never dreamed a disaster like this would befall our<br/>fair city... I need to make sure all the workshops are<br/>holding up.')
('Lawrence', "I work closely with them for my job. If they're out of<br/>commission, it could throw a wrench in our<br/>whole pipeline.")
('Lawrence', "But more than that, I want to make sure the<br/>PEOPLE are okay. I'll have to make the most of my<br/>connections here.")
('Lawrence', 'Those two siblings are like a whole routine in and<br/>of themselves. It never gets old watching them work<br/>the floor.')
('Lawrence', "The network issues here have messed up my itinerary<br/>today, so I'm just standing by here.")
('Lawrence', "But I'm not complaining—there's hardly a boring<br/>moment here with those two around.")
('Lawrence', 'Basel is home to many a skilled artisan, and that<br/>draws demand from all around the globe.')
('Lawrence', 'But in some ways, we actually have TOO many—it<br/>can make picking the right one difficult, especially for<br/>the uninitiated client.')
('Lawrence', "That's where I come in. I act as a consultant to help<br/>clients pick the workshop that's right for them.")
('Lawrence', "It's funny, really: I used to be an engineer, but I<br/>hardly do any engineering myself anymore.")
('Lawrence', "I'm an engineering consultant who works with clients<br/>and workshops both, so that they can work together<br/>at peak efficiency.")
('Lawrence', "So my travels often bring me to Basel, naturally.<br/>I'm something of a regular here at the inn.")
('Lawrence', "Basel's artisans speak for themselves in terms<br/>of quality. Clients everywhere want their work, and<br/>my job is to help them get it.")
('Lawrence', "Just the other day, I hooked up a prestigious<br/>watchmaking firm with Gowland's Workshop to<br/>make their custom gears.")
('Melise', "I was sitting down for business talks with Verne when<br/>everything just...fell to chaos! I couldn't believe my<br/>eyes...!")
('Melise', 'We were safe inside that building, thankfully, but<br/>everybody was shaken—and understandably so.')
('Melise', "I hear they attacked some other town, too... And now<br/>that the roads are closed in response, I'm<br/>stranded here.")
('Melise', "Mmgh... There's just nothing I can do. I guess, well...<br/>I might as well make the most of it, if I'm gonna be<br/>stuck here!")
('Melise', "I've got a big meeting with a representative from<br/>Verne today.")
('Melise', "I really can't be bothered, if I'm being honest.<br/>I agreed to the trip for pleasure first and<br/>business second.")
('Melise', "But I need to at least ACT like I care, or I can kiss<br/>any future business trips goodbye. And I can't have<br/>that, now can I?")
('Melise', "I've gotta suck it up and nail this meeting—if for<br/>nothing else, for securing cushy trips like these in<br/>the future!")
('Melise', "This cafeteria's a bit on the noisy side...but then, so<br/>is Basel. It fits the city, no? So maybe it's not so bad.")
('Melise', "And I can't complain when the beer tastes this good.")
('Melise', "It really does taste better when you're just drinking for<br/>yourself instead of having to schmooze with clients.")
('Melise', "And since my company's paying the tab... Heh<br/>heh heh! I can drink as much as I want!<br/>Guilt-free drinks are the best drinks!")
('Melise', "Ahh...! Now I'm all checked in here, and I can take it<br/>easy for the rest of the day. This is the life!")
('Melise', 'What am I here for? Well, I work for a wholesale<br/>company that deals with industrial orbments.')
('Melise', "They shipped me out here to check out what's hot on<br/>the market and bring some samples back, plus talk to<br/>some of the manufacturers.")
('Melise', "But all of that can wait for tomorrow! Today, I've got<br/>dinner for one and a bottomless wallet!<br/>Thank Goddess for company funds!")
('Receptionist Alex', "Zin had told me that Renne was capable, and<br/>goodness, he wasn't kidding. 'Capable' is almost<br/>underselling her.")
('Receptionist Alex', 'She had our issues diagnosed in a flash—and she even<br/>pointed out the potential link between the network<br/>and the septium veins, too.')
('Receptionist Alex', "She's wise beyond her years, for certain. It's a shame<br/>that experience had to come from the sort of 'trouble'<br/>she referenced.")
('Receptionist Alex', "While she's an excellent mind, we can't push all the<br/>work onto her—she is still a child, after all. We adults<br/>need to pull our own weight.")
('Receptionist Alex', "Blanca was badly injured in the assault, but the<br/>doctors are saying she's in stable condition now.<br/>That's a huge relief...")
('Receptionist Alex', "I didn't think Almata would wreak this much havoc.<br/>Have they no mercy?")
('Receptionist Alex', "We need to do everything we can to stop them, and<br/>we won't rest until they're brought to justice. You all<br/>stay safe out there!")
('Receptionist Alex', "I've reported all this to the Edith branch and brought<br/>Zin up to speed.")
('Receptionist Alex', "They said they're gonna try looking into the<br/>Anchorville Company for us, too.")
('Receptionist Alex', "I investigated them myself, and I learned that they've<br/>been bringing this suspicious freight truck into the<br/>city lately...")
('Receptionist Alex', "I'll have to look into that more. Could it be related to<br/>Almata's dealings with Professor Callaghan...?")
('Receptionist Alex', "We need to be proactive here, or we'll have another<br/>Tharbad on our hands.")
('Receptionist Alex', 'Stay sharp, everyone!')
('Receptionist Alex', 'Oh, I was just wondering about you, Van.')
('Receptionist Alex', 'I take it you got called out here to investigate all these<br/>events yourself? Those suspicious sightings did garner<br/>a lot of attention.')
('Van', 'Pretty much, yeah.')
('Van', "You sound like you're well up on the issue yourself.")
('Receptionist Alex', "Indeed. That's partly why I called Alvis and<br/>Regina here.")
('Receptionist Alex', "It could all just be a big load of nothing, so we can't<br/>set aside too many men for it, but better safe<br/>than sorry.")
('Receptionist Alex', "I did want to ask for your opinion on all this, given<br/>you've had your fair share of run-ins with<br/>Almata yourself.")
('Van', 'Heh. Tell me about it.')
('Van', "My take: it's just too early to tell. Not enough to<br/>go on, here.")
('Receptionist Alex', 'I get that... Thanks for your input. If anything does<br/>happen, please let us know.')
('Receptionist Alex', "I've told the others to cut you some slack, at any rate.")
('Receptionist Alex', "I don't exactly have the intuition for this yet, but even<br/>I can tell something isn't right here...")
('Receptionist Alex', "With everything that's happened these last few<br/>months, we can't just write off leads and<br/>oddities anymore.")
('Receptionist Alex', 'I might have to loop back with Blanca and get her<br/>perspective on things.')
('Receptionist Alex', "Word is you've been busy yourself, Van. I keep<br/>hearing about all these jobs you're taking on.")
('Receptionist Alex', "Seems like all of Calvard's running into trouble...and<br/>I can't deny that worries me. It makes these reports<br/>here all the more alarming.")
('Van', "Guild's on alert, too, huh? I dunno much about what's<br/>goin' on here in Basel yet, but hopefully we'll get to<br/>the bottom of it soon.")
('Receptionist Alex', "I hope so, too... We're not technically working<br/>together, but it would be best for us to cooperate on<br/>this nonetheless.")
('Van', 'Agreed. Good luck out there, Alex.')
('Receptionist Alex', "I've gotten word about how the power grid and orbal<br/>network have been acting up lately, too.")
('Receptionist Alex', "It's only been minor blips so far—I didn't notice until<br/>somebody pointed it out.")
('Receptionist Alex', "But we shouldn't just ignore it...and that's all the<br/>more reason we need a tech-savvy bracer out here to<br/>help us out.")
('Receptionist Alex', "Regina's even able to use the generalized Aeon<br/>system, so she should be just what the doctor ordered.")
('Receptionist Alex', "So there was trouble down in that mine, was there?<br/>I'm glad you all came out of there unscathed—<br/>Quatre, too.")
('Receptionist Alex', "Still, something just seems...off. I've never heard of<br/>monsters getting aggressive like that.")
('Receptionist Alex', "We'll look into it on our end—we might be able to<br/>find a lead or two.")
('Bracer Blanca', "I'm ashamed that you had to see me like<br/>that yesterday. I have no excuses—they overpowered<br/>me, plain and simple.")
('Van', "Don't beat yourself up over it—they got one of my<br/>guys, too. Happens to the best of us.")
('Aaron', 'Just getting out of there alive is reason enough<br/>to celebrate.')
('Agnès', 'I agree—and the fact that you were able to hold them<br/>off that long bought us valuable time.')
('Bracer Blanca', "Heh... Guess you're right, yeah. Look on the bright<br/>side, huh?")
('Bracer Blanca', "We'll need your help and a whole lot more if we're to<br/>even stand a chance against Almata and the Gardens.")
('Bracer Blanca', "We're counting on you. Don't let them get away<br/>with this...")
('Feri', "We won't!")
('Van', "That goes without sayin'. You bet your ass we'll bring<br/>'em to justice.")
('Bracer Blanca', "We'll need your help and a whole lot more if we're to<br/>even stand a chance against Almata and the Gardens.")
('Bracer Blanca', "We're counting on you. Don't let them get away<br/>with this...")
('Bracer Blanca', 'Did Alvis head off on patrol?')
('Bracer Regina', "Yeah, he went out earlier. Once he's done, I'll start<br/>my rounds.")
('Bracer Blanca', "It's a shame he couldn't have let you do your rounds<br/>first so you could hit the hay earlier.")
('Bracer Blanca', "How inconsiderate. He'd have scored brownie points<br/>with you if he said 'ladies first'.")
('Bracer Regina', 'I, erm... I guess? Haha...')
('Bracer Blanca', 'First the fire at that plant, and then that car was<br/>having trouble...')
('Bracer Blanca', "*sigh* I'm beat, and it's only the afternoon. I really<br/>can't do all this on my own.")
('Bracer Blanca', 'Thank the Goddess that Regina and the others are<br/>here to help.')
('Bracer Blanca', "Maybe we can finally clear out that backlog I've<br/>built up.")
('Bracer Blanca', "Alex was telling me all about you. You're awfully<br/>interesting folks, from the sounds of it!")
('Bracer Blanca', "Hopefully we don't have to tackle any big cases<br/>together, but if we do, I'll have your back.")
('Bracer Blanca', "Basel's deceptively big, is the thing. I like to set a<br/>quota of ten cases a day, just to maintain a<br/>steady pace.")
('Bracer Regina', "Man, you're really on top of things.")
('Bracer Regina', "Come to think of it, you used to be in the fire<br/>department, didn't you?")
('Bracer Blanca', 'I did. I learned some valuable skills on the job—they<br/>still come in handy today.')
('Bracer Blanca', "It's a tough job. Basel's full of factories and other<br/>heavy industry—fire hazards are abundant.")
('Bracer Blanca', "Every second counts with those places. A moment's<br/>hesitation could mean the difference between saving a<br/>life and losing one.")
('Bracer Blanca', "That's how I learned to be swift and decisive on<br/>the job. Sometimes you don't have the luxury<br/>of second-guessing.")
('Bracer Regina', "I... I see! I'll bear that in mind!")
('Bracer Alvis', "We're gonna head out pretty shortly ourselves.")
('Bracer Alvis', 'Alex should be able to hold down the fort, especially<br/>with Renne helping out.')
('Bracer Alvis', "If Almata does want Basel, there's no way this was<br/>their only planned attack. They're gonna be back for<br/>more someday.")
('Bracer Alvis', "That's all the more reason why we've gotta stop them<br/>in their tracks!")
('Bracer Alvis', "I really shouldn't have gotten so carried away over<br/>RC cars...")
('Bracer Alvis', "Especially when I have bigger jobs to worry about.<br/>There are a lot of questions we still can't answer.")
('Bracer Alvis', "If you learn anything on your end, let the guild know<br/>ASAP, 'kay?")
('Bracer Alvis', 'Hmph. Of course you guys got here first. We had to<br/>stop by a bunch of small towns on the way here.')
('Bracer Alvis', "But that's the tradeoff with being a public servant<br/>instead of a private eye.")
('Bracer Alvis', "As soon as we're all checked in, we're heading right<br/>out into the field. Don't go making more work for us!")
('Bracer Blanca', "I might have broken a bone or two, but I'll be okay.<br/>This shouldn't slow me down all that much.")
('Bracer Blanca', "I just can't believe what they did to<br/>Professor Callaghan... They really are dangerous.")
('Bracer Regina', "I agree, but please, don't push yourself. Just leave this<br/>to us, all right?")
('Bracer Regina', "We'll sort all this out—promise!")
('Bracer Blanca', "I'm sure you will. Heh, we can't have Marduk<br/>showing us up more than they already have.")
('Bracer Regina', "This is gonna be really sketchy with Blanca out of<br/>commission, but we can't let that get to us.<br/>We've gotta cover for her!")
('Bracer Regina', "We're counting on you, too! Let us know if you learn<br/>anything out there.")
('Bracer Regina', "Blanca's just so skilled as a bracer–and she's a<br/>wonderful person, too. I hope to be like her one day.")
('Bracer Regina', "I've got a long way to go before I compare to her...")
('Bracer Regina', "We ran into Blanca not long after we arrived.<br/>Man, she's fast as ever!")
('Bracer Regina', "We'll really have to get cracking if we wanna keep up<br/>with her.")
('Bracer Regina', "If you come across anything, just let us know—you're<br/>doing work for the guild anyway, so we might as well<br/>share intel.")
('Renne', "I'll keep looking on my end, of course.")
('Renne', "A certain factory is counting on me, among other<br/>people and groups. I can't exactly turn a blind eye to<br/>all of this.")
('Renne', "I've left Sasha in charge of the other students.<br/>I'm sure she'll be able to handle things for the rest of<br/>the day.")
('Renne', "I'd like to have another chat with Professor Cronkite,<br/>too, if I get the chance.")
('Renne', "I hope my hunch is off, but if it isn't, I'll have lots of<br/>things to look into.")
('Renne', "We're browsing the Artisanal District at the moment.<br/>These workshops are quite impressive.")
('Renne', "Basel reminds me a lot of Zeiss–it's this factory city<br/>over in Liberl.")
('Renne', 'And all these engineering types remind me of a<br/>certain old fellow, too...')
('Agnès', 'Hmm? Who would that be?')
('Renne', 'Oh, nobody. Heehee.')
('Renne', "(You've gotten yourselves wrapped up in yet more<br/>trouble, haven't you?)")
('Renne', '(Do be careful—that goes for all of you.)')
('Agnès', "(We will, don't worry.)")
('Van', "(If we need your help, we'll let'cha know.)")
('Aaron', '(Okay, who is this chick, anyway? Suspicious with a<br/>capital S.)')
('Renne', "I'm glad I was able to chat with Giscard while I<br/>was here. It would've been such a wasted<br/>opportunity otherwise.")
('Renne', "There's something else on my mind, too...<br/>Something worrying.")
('Renne', "But it could just be nothing, of course. I'll have to<br/>poke around a little, just in case.")
('Vicar Flictam', "Professor Callaghan's passing is most tragic, indeed.<br/>May Aidios guide his wayward soul.")
('Vicar Flictam', "His actions and yesterday's events have left many<br/>uneasy and confused. The future is deeply uncertain...")
('Vicar Flictam', "...but as a servant of the Goddess, I have faith in Her<br/>mercy and compassion. I must do what I can to ease<br/>the people's hearts.")
('Vicar Flictam', "I have heard about Professor Callaghan's<br/>disappearance as well.")
('Vicar Flictam', "We have asked the congregation to share any hints<br/>toward his whereabouts, but we haven't learned<br/>anything so far.")
('Vicar Flictam', 'I did also hear that he had been mistreating<br/>his assistants...')
('Vicar Flictam', 'I hoped it was only coincidence that his assistants<br/>looked exhausted whenever I would see them...but I<br/>was wrong, I see.')
('Vicar Flictam', "Sister Paula seemed very nervous when she first<br/>arrived, but I can see that she's settling into her<br/>role well.")
('Vicar Flictam', 'I do plan to help teach her some more, if and when I<br/>get the chance.')
('Vicar Flictam', "Well, what a pleasant surprise. It's not often we greet<br/>travelers from afar in our humble church.")
('Vicar Flictam', 'We tend to only see locals here—artisans, students,<br/>researchers, and the like.')
('Vicar Flictam', 'We see some rather famous faces here, even. Big or<br/>small, we welcome everyone all the same.')
('Vicar Flictam', 'To worry is human. Those anxious or disconcerted<br/>may turn to open doors.')
('Sister Paula', 'I see! So astronomy originated in the Central East?')
('Vicar Flictam', 'That it did. To our understanding, astronomy came<br/>westward in the Middle Ages as trade and cultural<br/>exchange began to blossom.')
('Vicar Flictam', 'The University of Elsaim can trace itself back to that<br/>age, too—and that cultural exchange gave rise to the<br/>natural sciences as well.')
('Sister Paula', "I see... I've never had much interest in hard sciences,<br/>but that's interesting to hear.")
('Sister Paula', 'It feels...relatable, I guess, to hear that they were<br/>human inventions, too.')
('Vicar Flictam', "That's good to hear. If you're curious about anything<br/>else, I would be happy to help.")
('Sister Paula', "We've been awfully busy today. Yesterday's events<br/>have taken a toll on everyone...")
('Sister Paula', "I still can't believe it happened at all. Why here...<br/>and how?")
('Sister Paula', 'But I... I have to do something. The people here need<br/>our help.')
('Sister Paula', "I'm still feeling uneasy myself, but as a woman of the<br/>cloth, I have to stay strong.")
('Sister Paula', 'I need to help out however I can, like Father<br/>Flictam does!')
('Sister Paula', 'I heard that a professor from the institute<br/>went missing... I can only pray that Aidios extends<br/>Her guiding hand to them.')
('Sister Paula', "I'm far from an expert on this city and its customs...")
('Sister Paula', "...but I believe the Goddess' light shines brightly here,<br/>all the same.")
('Sister Paula', "I will pray for the professor's safety today.")
('Sister Paula', "I've never held much interest in the sciences, but they<br/>do seem more relatable to me, now.")
('Sister Paula', "Maybe it won't feel so foreign anymore, when the<br/>congregation talks about them.")
('Sister Paula', "Oh, hello there. My name is Sister Paula. I'm new to<br/>Basel and this church.")
('Sister Paula', "Admittedly, it's quite daunting... I grew up in<br/>the country. These fancy machines and technology<br/>are so far beyond me.")
('Sister Paula', 'I can hardly wrap my head around what the artisans<br/>and students discuss with me...')
('Sister Paula', "Still, er... I-I'll do my best! I'm still knowledgeable<br/>about matters of the heart—if anything has you<br/>nervous, I'll help however I can.")
('Sister Paula', "I hardly ever saw machines in my hometown, and<br/>now I'm surrounded by them.")
('Sister Paula', "I want to help the townsfolk here just as Father<br/>Flictam does, but I've definitely got my work cut out<br/>for me.")
('Professor Aurelie', "I'm planning to call in a specialist to help, but for<br/>now, I need to focus on calming her down first.")
('Professor Aurelie', 'The church has helped me through my problems an<br/>awful lot over the years. I know they can help<br/>her, too.')
('Professor Aurelie', 'I just hope Cindy takes this opportunity to start on a<br/>healthier path.')
('Researcher Cindy', 'I could just feel my mind going blank at first.')
('Researcher Cindy', "But Professor Aurelie and Father Flictam did help me<br/>calm down a bit... I think I'm feeling better now.")
('Researcher Cindy', "I'm still awfully nervous, but I'm not<br/>panicking anymore. I think now I have to start<br/>figuring out where to go from here.")
('Researcher Cindy', "I'm not sure I ever would've asked for help if<br/>Professor Aurelie hadn't came and talked about it<br/>with me...")
('Researcher Cindy', "It felt like my head was gonna explode...but it's<br/>over now. I can start putting it behind me.")
('Researcher Cindy', "She's right: I can't change what happened, but I<br/>CAN start over.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "As if we didn't have enough on our plate...<br/>Now we've got this. We look real bad right now.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "How'd we screw up the math on this? The numbers<br/>don't add up, so we must've made a mistake<br/>somewhere and compounded on it...")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "We'll look into this, but we've got our hands full with<br/>Callaghan, too. You guys learn anything, let us know,<br/>all right?!")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Damn it all! The Artisanal District's all on fire, but<br/>we can't give up our position or WE'RE screwed...!")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Keep an eye out for anybody caught in the crossfire!<br/>There's people trapped everywhere!")
('Quatre', 'Right!')
('Quatre', "We've been around already! We think everyone's<br/>safely out!")
('Van', "We're gonna head over to the institute now.<br/>Anybody we find on the way, we'll help 'em out.")
('Van', 'You and your guys hold down the workshop, all right?')
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Got'cha!")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "They've crossed the line now, the bastards...")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "...but we're not gonna sit here and take it!<br/>We're taking our Basel back! I'm counting on<br/>you, youngsters!")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Tch. Tausend... If he wanted to do what's best for<br/>Verne, he'd grow a damn spine.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "No, he can't know about every little under-the-table<br/>deal those billion subsidiaries are doing...")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "...but it's still his job to keep everything above board.<br/>He's gotta stamp that crap out when he sees it.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "We at the Artisans' Guild're gonna try and crack<br/>down on Callaghan. If Tausend won't do it, we'll<br/>bring that blockhead down ourselves.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "We're starting with his supply chains—he might've<br/>shacked up in some abandoned warehouse somewhere.<br/>We're tracking his purchases, too.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "I thought you'd have called it for the day.<br/>Hard workers you lot are, huh?")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', 'Just between you and me: keep an eye on Quatre,<br/>will ya?')
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "He shouldn't have to take on all that responsibility at<br/>his age, if you ask me. It's like he never got to be<br/>a kid.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Seeing him all stressed out and overworked just<br/>makes me sad, as an ol' geezer with none of that<br/>youth left.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "What's Quatre crunching for? He shouldn't have to<br/>stay so late at the institute...")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "I get it's important to him—he wants to follow in the<br/>professor's footsteps with all his research there. Just...<br/>*sigh*")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Y'know, I don't take kindly to outsiders, but a friend<br/>of Quatre's is a friend of mine. I owe you that much<br/>for saving his life.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Might hafta ask you wear a blindfold here on the<br/>floor, though. Top secret stuff goin' on here.")
('Agnès', 'That might be a bit dangerous. Uhh, haha...')
('Van', "Hey, you're not so crotchety after all. Nice to have a<br/>friend in you, ol' bud.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Same here. Of course, you cause any trouble and<br/>you'll be right back out the door. Wahaha!")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "You're showing 'em around, Quatre? Just be careful<br/>with that.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "You know the drill: Eugen's got you covered if your<br/>drones need a fixin'.")
('Quatre', 'Thank you! I really do appreciate you always looking<br/>out for me.')
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Quatre's like a grandson to me—I'd walk through<br/>Gehenna for that kid. This stuff's the least I can do.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "I'm sure you'll be just fine out there, lad, but<br/>be careful!")
('Chief Manager Eugen', "I feel awful... I'm the chief on site here, so this<br/>responsibility falls onto me.")
('Chief Manager Eugen', "We'll investigate however we can, at any rate. It still<br/>feels really ominous here...")
('Chief Manager Eugen', 'We really do owe you one, though. I can see why our<br/>supervisor trusts you.')
('Chief Manager Eugen', "I'm not sure how I feel about Quatre going with you,<br/>but...that's his choice. Please take care of him.")
('Van', "We will. Don't do anything reckless yourself,<br/>you hear?")
('Quatre', 'I agree. Please stay safe, Eugen!')
('Chief Manager Eugen', 'We have our doors open to anyone who needs shelter.')
('Chief Manager Eugen', 'Stay safe out there, everyone. Aidios watch over you!')
('Chief Manager Eugen', 'That researcher said those metals were the last things<br/>she needed.')
('Chief Manager Eugen', "Then she said she was off to Liberl next, so I'm<br/>guessing she made for Auge Canyon?")
('Chief Manager Eugen', 'Some students from Aramis came by to visit earlier.')
('Chief Manager Eugen', "I wasn't able to tell them much, but I did give them a<br/>general overview of what we do here.")
('Chief Manager Eugen', 'They were smart cookies, but one of them was leaps<br/>and bounds above the others... Hard to believe she<br/>was just a student.')
('Chief Manager Eugen', 'Even the supervisor was impressed!')
('Chief Manager Eugen', 'I hate making the kids wait, but this deadline<br/>is non-negotiable.')
('Chief Manager Eugen', 'Speaking of kids, I hear Millia was up to something<br/>earlier today.')
('Chief Manager Eugen', "Most of the time, she's a model daughter. She helps<br/>me with the shopping, the cooking, and<br/>the cleaning...")
('Chief Manager Eugen', "...but every now and then, I hear just the strangest<br/>things about what she's up to. I can't deny it worries<br/>me sometimes.")
('Chief Manager Eugen', "I'm really sorry for how hostile we were earlier.<br/>It's just, our work here is extremely confidential.")
('Chief Manager Eugen', 'After saving Quatre, though? We owe you the keys to<br/>the whole damn town.')
('Chief Manager Eugen', "So if you need any work done on your orbments, just<br/>let us know. We're happy to help.")
('Feri', "Whoa, really? Isn't this the best workshop in Basel<br/>or something?")
('Quatre', "That it is. Eugen here is Supervisor Giscard's<br/>righthand man.")
('Quatre', "He's one of the most skilled engineers in the whole<br/>country—I can personally vouch for that.")
('Agnès', "Wow... I'm honored!")
('Aaron', "Damn, sick deal. Hey, you couldn't give us a<br/>friend-of-an-employee discount, could you?")
('Chief Manager Eugen', "I can't go quite that far, I'm afraid...")
('Chief Manager Eugen', "And really, I'm not THAT good...am I? Haha...")
('Chief Manager Eugen', "Quatre's a familiar face here. We helped develop his<br/>orbal drones.")
('Chief Manager Eugen', 'Though really, he did most of the work. We just<br/>helped manufacture the parts themselves.')
('Quatre', "Oh, don't sell yourself short. You were an immense<br/>help with testing and debugging.")
('Quatre', "It was a team effort—I couldn't have finished them<br/>without all of your help.")
('Chief Manager Eugen', "Don't sell YOUR self short, haha.")
('Chief Manager Eugen', "At any rate, Quatre's like family to all of us here.<br/>FIO and XEROS, too.")
('Engineer Riel', "This is just a disaster...! We can't let those weapon<br/>parts out into the field!")
('Engineer Riel', "It'd be difficult to actually reverse-engineer them, but<br/>it's not completely off the table, and that really<br/>unnerves me...")
('Engineer Riel', "This project is supposed to be absolutely<br/>confidential, too. We just CAN'T let this happen...")
('Engineer Riel', 'I gotta get to the bottom of this, and fast...!')
('Engineer Riel', "Thank you so much for your help. You've really<br/>grown up into a strong young man, haven't<br/>you, Quatre?")
('Engineer Riel', "Just don't go rushing into trouble, all right? If things<br/>look bad, get out!")
('Quatre', "I-I'm fine, honestly. I've got FIO and XEROS here<br/>with me.")
('Quatre', "It wouldn't feel right to just sit idly by. What would I<br/>say to Gran if I just let them overrun the city?")
('Engineer Riel', "I... I guess you're right. Just please be careful!")
('Engineer Riel', "I'm sure you're in good hands with these friends of<br/>yours...and FIO and XEROS, too...")
('Engineer Riel', "...but just, I'm such a worrywart with these things!<br/>Promise me you'll come back safely...!")
('Engineer Riel', "I heard about what happened over at the institute.<br/>It sounds like the Artisans' Guild is helping out<br/>however they can.")
('Engineer Riel', "I'm really worried for Quatre, though...")
('Engineer Riel', "And the institute... We can't just let those goons take<br/>it over, or all of Professor Hamilton's work will go<br/>to waste!")
('Engineer Riel', "Whew... I think we're almost done for the day. I hate<br/>making Nat wait like this.")
('Engineer Riel', 'I really am glad I started working here, though.')
('Engineer Riel', "I remember being scared half to death over how I'd<br/>handle the pressure. It's been really tough work,<br/>for sure...")
('Engineer Riel', "...but it's so rewarding! And I can feel myself getting<br/>better day by day. Plus I've made friends with Quatre<br/>and so many others!")
('Engineer Riel', "Thank you so much for rescuing Quatre. I was really<br/>worried when I heard he'd gone down to the mine all<br/>by himself.")
('Van', 'Hey, we got a card rank upgrade out of it. I think it<br/>worked out pretty well for us.')
('Engineer Riel', "I really wish you'd just turned back when things got<br/>ugly, though... Your drones can't do everything<br/>out there.")
('Engineer Riel', "We were all worried to death... What if you'd<br/>gotten hurt?")
('Quatre', "You're right... I'm not sure what I was thinking.<br/>I'm really sorry for worrying you.")
('Quatre', "I just... I felt like I had to act. It didn't feel right to sit<br/>back and do nothing.")
('Engineer Riel', "I know, and that's really admirable of you.<br/>You're such a big help to everyone here...")
('Engineer Riel', "...but don't risk yourself for other people like<br/>that, okay? We're here to help you when you need<br/>it, too.")
('Engineer Riel', 'Most of the people who work here are on the older<br/>side, so I really like having someone my age as<br/>a friend.')
('Nat', 'Riel let me come along like usual, but she said today,<br/>she was scared to leave me at home.')
('Nat', "And everybody's kinda sad today, for some reason...")
('Nat', 'I wonder what happened?')
('Nat', 'Careful up there, Riel!')
('Nat', "I really wanna see the machines from up there, too!<br/>But everyone says it's too dangerous, so I gotta wait...")
('Nat', "When I'm older, I'm gonna work here like Riel does,<br/>and then I can see all the cool stuff I want!")
('Nat', "I'm so glad Quatre's okay!")
('Nat', 'You were the ones who helped him, right? Are you<br/>his friends?')
('Van', "Eh, more like acquaintances. He's been helpin' us out<br/>a bit.")
('Van', 'What about you, kid? Your mom or pop work here?')
('Quatre', "His name's Nat. He's Riel's younger brother.")
('Quatre', "He just can't keep himself out of the factory, so he<br/>tags along with her a lot. Vehicles especially pique<br/>his interest.")
('Nat', "Yeah! They're making a big robot here now, right?")
('Nat', "I wanna see it! C'mon, lemme see!")
('Quatre', "We've all warned Riel that Nat shouldn't be walking<br/>around the shop floor, but she just can't say no<br/>to him...")
('Quatre', "And they do a lot of top-secret work here. They turn<br/>a blind eye to him because he's family, but still...")
('Quatre', "Hey, Nat, just don't get too close to anything, okay?<br/>You don't want to make people worried.")
('Nat', 'Okay!')
('Nat', 'I really like this workshop! My sister works here, and<br/>they make these cool cars sometimes, too!')
('Nat', "Sometimes they tell me it's dangerous and I shouldn't<br/>walk around, but everyone's really cool here!")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'Thank you sooo much for helping us out there!')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "We'll try and get in touch with everyone we can.<br/>Just leave that to me—I'm one of Professor<br/>Hamilton's students for a reason!")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "Please do be careful if you're headed for the institute,<br/>all right?")
('Quatre', "Same to you, Essy. Just stay inside, we'll handle this!")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "I'm worried sick about the institute... I hope all the<br/>students managed to get out of there safely.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'The whole place is full of priceless equipment,<br/>to boot... Is that their aim?')
('Feri', "Agnès says she'll be here in about fifteen minutes!")
('Van', "That's surprisingly quick. I was about to suggest we<br/>get started if she was gonna be much longer.")
('Van', "All right, then. While we're waiting, it's<br/>engadin time!")
('Feri', '...Right now?')
('Van', 'Umm... Yeah! Gotta order ahead of time so we can<br/>dig in as soon as Agnès gets here, of course!')
('Feri', 'I thought so.')
('Aaron', 'Real slick.')
('Risette', 'Shall we order one along with some coffee, then?')
('Quatre', 'Here we are. This is the Artisanal District.')
('Agnès', "Now I just need to find the hotel they're staying at.")
('Agnès', "Oh! There's Van's pickup truck.")
('Quatre', "So he drives an Ingert? He's even customized<br/>the frame.")
('Quatre', 'Wait! That material was only just developed!<br/>How did he get his hands on it?')
('Agnès', "I didn't realize you were an expert.")
('Quatre', 'You pick this kind of thing up if you work with Verne<br/>long enough, I suppose.')
('Quatre', 'So how did you get to know people like them?')
('Agnès', 'What do you mean?')
('Quatre', 'The spriggan—whatever you call him—and that<br/>red-haired guy both seemed really shady to me.')
('Quatre', 'Though the girl and the...maid, I think? They looked<br/>like good people, at least.')
('Quatre', "I'm just having a hard time picturing what kind of<br/>group it actually is if you're involved with them, too.")
('Agnès', "(Well, I can't blame him for thinking that way<br/>about them...)")
('Agnès', "Umm... Van runs a problem-solving agency, in short.<br/>I work there as a part-time assistant for reasons I can't<br/>get into.")
('Agnès', 'And both work and my duties as a student happened<br/>to bring me here at the same time.')
('Quatre', "Sounds like you've got a lot on your plate...")
('Quatre', "Are you sure it's okay to be working with<br/>them, though? Verne's CEO didn't seem very happy<br/>about them sniffing around.")
('Agnès', "O-Our work is complicated, I'll admit, but we don't<br/>do anything illegal!")
('Agnès', '(...Technically.)')
('Quatre', "*sigh* His willingness to hire an upstanding young<br/>lady like you does reflect well on him, I'll give<br/>him that.")
('Quatre', "...Even if I don't think highly of his choice to involve<br/>someone like you in a business like his.")
('Agnès', 'Ahaha... People say that about him a lot.')
('Agnès', 'You have nothing to worry about, though, really.<br/>He might skirt the rules here and there...')
('Agnès', "...but he's still a man I can genuinely respect.")
('Quatre', 'Well, if you say so.')
('Quatre', 'He feels like one of those guys who takes some<br/>getting used to. The way he treated me was just...')
('Quatre', 'Ugh. I was so close to forgetting, too...')
('Agnès', 'Did...something happen?')
('Quatre', "N-Nothing worth bringing up! Anyway, we shouldn't<br/>keep your friends waiting.")
('Feri', "Agnès! We're over here!")
('Van', 'You came quick.')
('Aaron', "Oh, wait a sec. Isn't that...?")
('Agnès', 'Sorry for keeping you.')
('Agnès', 'Quatre was good enough to guide me here.')
('Van', "Huh. Thanks for helpin' her out.")
('Van', 'We ordered an engadin for the group. You wanna<br/>join us?')
('Quatre', "Hmm? No, I'm fine. I'm not hungry right now.")
('Van', "Your loss. That taste is downright divine. I'll make it<br/>up to you some other time, then.")
('Quatre', "...You don't owe me anything. It's not like I did<br/>anything special.")
('Quatre', "I suggest you don't pull any funny business while<br/>you're in the city, though.")
('Quatre', 'No causing trouble for the women in your<br/>group, either.')
('Risette', '...Oh?')
('Feri', 'Umm...')
('Quatre', "I'll get going now, Agnès. Let me know if you need<br/>my help with anything.")
('Agnès', 'Oh! I will. Thank you!')
('Van', "Man, would've been nice if he gave me the chance to<br/>thank him somehow.")
('Aaron', "Heh. Puberty's rough.")
('Aaron', 'He sure had a soft spot for you, though.')
('Agnès', 'Do you think? He just struck me as the very friendly<br/>sort in general. We got along right away.')
('Feri', 'I hope I can be friends with him, too.')
('Agnès', "Oh, I'm sure that won't be a problem one bit. I'll be<br/>happy to introduce you if we get the chance.")
('Aaron', 'How old are you, five?')
('Risette', "There's nothing wrong with wanting to make friends.")
('Van', 'Yeah, no need to rain on her parade.')
('Grani', "Here's your order! One of our famed engadins.")
('Van', "Now THIS is what I'm talkin' about!")
('Feri', 'Come and have a seat, Agnès!')
('Risette', "I'll get to cutting it right away.")
('Quatre', 'She always used to make engadins for me back in<br/>the day...')
('Quatre', "I've finished, Quatre. I'm quite confident in<br/>today's dessert.")
('Quatre', 'The more worried you are about something, the more<br/>important it is to take a break and relax. No need to<br/>push through.')
('Quatre', "(I think I can trust Agnès, but I'd better keep a close<br/>eye on the rest of them.)")
('Quatre', "(I don't want anything threatening a place so special<br/>to me.)")
('Quatre', "Hmm... I suppose it wouldn't hurt to say hello to the<br/>supervisor and take care of my usual work while<br/>I'm here.")
('Van', "Mmm! THAT'S the stuff!")
('Van', "You won't find a better marriage of flavors than these<br/>bitter walnuts with sweet caramel nougat. It's so<br/>mouthwateringly rich!")
('Van', "And you wouldn't believe how well it pairs with<br/>strong coffee! I swear, I was born just to savor<br/>moments like these...")
('Aaron', 'No one wants to hear this every time, you know.<br/>Just eat the damn thing.')
('Agnès', "Ahaha. He's describing it to a T, though. I can't get<br/>enough of that buttery flavor.")
('Feri', "*munch* If Van says it's good, then you know you're<br/>in for a treat.")
('Van', "Heh. My nose is good for more than just sniffin' out<br/>trouble, you know!")
('Aaron', "I feel like you're joking, but I could buy it working for<br/>stuff like this easy.")
('Risette', "Indeed. Now, I think we've rested for long enough.<br/>Perhaps we should get to work.")
('Risette', 'Do you think we should prioritize<br/>investigating Verne?')
('Van', "Nah, I think we should hold off doing that. I can't<br/>imagine we'd find anything major this fast even if<br/>we tried.")
('Van', "I'm thinkin' we should start with wandering around<br/>Basel and takin' care of 4SPGs. That'll give us a<br/>decent idea of the situation here.")
('Agnès', 'The same pattern as usual, then? But how can you be<br/>so sure that word of our work has spread to here?')
('Feri', "Good question... Verne's boss sure didn't seem like he<br/>wanted to help us any more than he had to.")
('Van', "Oh, I don't think we gotta worry about that.<br/>Not after my headache of a friend slapped this job<br/>on us.")
('Agnès', 'Right...')
('Feri', 'That man from the CID?')
('Risette', "He did seem like a highly capable person—though<br/>that's the least to be expected of their chief analyst.")
('Risette', 'You and he go back quite some time, I believe?')
('Van', 'Unfortunately, yeah.')
('Van', "I doubt he's here in person, though. More than likely<br/>he sent someone in his place.")
('Aaron', "Between this and that other project he teased, I'm<br/>sure there's a ton of scheming going on in that head<br/>of his.")
('Aaron', "Guess we should go find out what kinda 4SPGs we've<br/>got waiting for us, then.")
('Agnès', '...')
('Van', 'So, when do you need to be back at the hotel?')
('Van', "And what're you gonna do about your uniform?")
('Agnès', 'Renne said to be back by 6:30PM.')
('Agnès', "I brought some clothes besides my uniform,<br/>don't worry! Let me go and get changed.")
('Feri', "I'll take you to our room, then!")
('Risette', 'We will handle paying the bill in the meantime.')
('System', "Feri took Agnès to the girls' room so that she could<br/>get changed.")
('System', 'After she was done, they reunited with the rest of the<br/>group and began their first day of work in Basel.')
('Feri', 'Oh!')
('Aaron', 'Get a load of that...')
(500, 'Giscard Workshop')
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Come on, we ain't got all day! Get that work done!")
(40301, 'Yes, sir!')
('Agnès', "Are those from one of the Empire's Panzer Soldats?<br/>...No, they seem a little different.")
('Van', "Yeah. Word about these things has gotten out in<br/>certain circles, but most people still don't know about<br/>'em yet.")
('Van', "Guessin' you do, though. Your company's involved in<br/>their development, right?")
('Risette', 'Yes—though not that much. We have only been<br/>assisting in trials.')
(40301, "Who're you guys? I haven't seen you around before...<br/>This is a restricted area, y'know.")
(40302, "I totally get why you'd wanna gawk at these beauties,<br/>but they're technically not public knowledge yet.")
(40302, 'Go ahead and move along, now.')
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "...Hmm? Wonder if they're the guys...")
('Feri', "I didn't know machines like that were being made<br/>here in Calvard, too.")
('Van', "Sure are. I've heard the concept behind their design is<br/>different from the Soldats over in Erebonia, though.")
('Van', "They're gonna be revealed to the public along with<br/>their name sometime soon.")
('Aaron', "Hmph. Sure feels like we saw something we weren't<br/>supposed to, even if it was just the legs.")
('Agnès', "I imagine that while they're being kept a secret from<br/>the public, most major groups and organizations have<br/>already been told about them.")
('Agnès', 'That includes those abroad, our international allies...<br/>maybe even the Empire.')
('Risette', "I believe you're correct in your assumptions.")
('Van', "Think that's true for all the weaponry that's gonna be<br/>rolled out soon, too. Not just our Soldat-lookalikes.")
('Van', "Either way, this looks like the biggest workshop in<br/>the Artisanal District. We'll have to come back<br/>another time if we get a chance.")
('Agnès', 'Hmm... I wonder who lives here.')
('Feri', "Yeah. It's really high up.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "Oooh! There they aaare! I'm so glad I finally<br/>found them.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'Hmm? Hello. Is there something you need<br/>from here?')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "The owner of this house hasn't been home in a while,<br/>I'm afraid.")
('Van', "We were just walkin' around and happened to end<br/>up here. So you know who owns this place, then?")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "Yeah. You could say we're acquaintances—well, that<br/>might sound a little too cold, actually.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "Hmm... I don't know if I could really call us family?<br/>But we are clooose... Just not as close as he is...")
('Aaron', "(Girl's IQ points've all gone into her face and tits.<br/>Total Ditz with a capital D.)")
('Agnès', '(A-Aaron!)')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'You know, you guys are all just adorable!<br/>Especially you, you tiny thing.')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'Where are you from? Do you want me to show<br/>you around?')
('Agnès', 'Umm...')
('Feri', "I'm not that tiny...")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'Oh! Silly me. I forgot I have somewhere else to be!')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "You won't be able to meet this house's owner, buuut<br/>the boy looking after it in her absence should be<br/>back tonight. Goodbye nooow!")
('Van', "She was dressed like she's a researcher at the institute<br/>or somethin'. Wish we could've talked to her a bit<br/>more about that.")
('Feri', "I wanted to make her understand my size isn't all<br/>there is to me! I'm strong, too!")
('Aaron', "Late twenties, huge tits, kind of an airhead,<br/>freckles, glasses... Yeah, I'd hit it.")
('Agnès', 'Are you going to start behaving like an adult, Aaron,<br/>or am I going to have to force you to?')
('Risette', '(I wonder if that could be...)')
('Van', "Sorry, guys. We're back.")
(40301, 'Wh-Who are you?')
(40302, "Oh, you're the group from earlier. I thought we told<br/>you that this was a restricted area?")
('Agnès', "Umm... Sorry, but Quatre hasn't been past here,<br/>has he?")
(40301, 'Wait, what?')
(40302, 'How do you know about—')
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "I'll handle this.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "I'm the supervisor of this here workshop, Giscard.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "I had a feeling when I saw you kids here earlier, but<br/>are you the ones Quatre's been showing around town?")
('Feri', '...!')
('Aaron', 'He told you about us?')
('Van', "That's right. We're from Arkride Solutions over in<br/>the capital.")
('Van', "I'll get right to the point: we have reason to believe<br/>he's in danger.")
('Van', "We think he might be in a mine or somethin'<br/>like one. If that rings any bells, can you take us there?")
(40301, 'What?!')
(40302, "Qu-Quatre's in danger?!")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Come with me. I'll hear your story while we're on<br/>the move.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', 'You two, contact the guild just in case! Get on it!')
('Risette', "So there's a mine shaft in the vicinity after all.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Yeah. It's used to extract a minor metal called linium.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "The signal's not great down there, which explains<br/>all the noise on your call.")
('Agnès', 'So this is where Quatre likely is?')
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Most likely, I'd wager. He goes to check all the lights<br/>and such're working every so often. He just went in<br/>earlier to do it again.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "It ain't all that big of a shaft, though, and there aren't<br/>usually any monsters down here.")
('Bracer Alvis', "Hmph. You should've just waited for us to arrive<br/>instead of going ahead on your own.")
('Bracer Alvis', '...Though I suppose I can commend you for rescuing<br/>him, at least.')
('Van', 'Haha. You did a bang-up job down there yourself.')
('Van', 'You got no chill every time we bump into you, but<br/>you pulled your weight back in Creil, too.')
('Bracer Alvis', "Hmph. I'm this close to being promoted to B-rank,<br/>so I would hope I could handle this much.")
('Bracer Alvis', "As for your snide little comment, you can mind your<br/>own damn business! I'm PERFECTLY chill,<br/>thank you!")
('Bracer Regina', "You're just proving his point, you know...")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "As for you, Quatre, why didn't you call us to let us<br/>know somethin' was off?!")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Everything worked out all right in the end this time,<br/>but that could've easily ended worse than it did.")
('Quatre', "I'm really sorry for worrying you...")
('Quatre', 'I thought I could handle it without any help since I<br/>had FIO with me.')
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Cheese 'n' crackers... Well, s'long as you're all right.<br/>That's all that matters.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "It's real worrying that monsters that big're showin' up<br/>down there, though. That shouldn't be happening.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', 'Course, orbment lights work to keep monsters away.<br/>Makes me wonder if them acting up is the cause...')
('Bracer Regina', '...Hmm?')
('Feri', 'Is something on your mind, Quatre?')
('Quatre', "Well, we saw them doing just that earlier, right?<br/>That's not the first time, either. It's been happening<br/>every so often lately.")
('Quatre', "They've gone out even when there was nothing wrong<br/>with the lights themselves, or they've done things they<br/>shouldn't be able to technically do.")
('Quatre', "There have been times when they've been<br/>malfunctioning one minute, then totally fine the next.")
('Aaron', 'So you went down there because it was<br/>bothering you?')
('Bracer Alvis', "...That's more or less in line with what we've been<br/>hearing back at the guild.")
('Risette', "I don't think we can rule out a connection with what<br/>we're here to investigate, either.")
('Van', "Yeah. Wish you'd told us that back when we were<br/>at Verne's HQ.")
('Quatre', "I'm sorry. I couldn't really mention it in front of<br/>the CEO...")
('Bracer Alvis', 'Thanks for this. This is all great to know, so the guild<br/>will keep it in mind, too.')
('Bracer Alvis', 'If anything else happens, could you let us know<br/>right away?')
('Chief Engineer Giscard', 'Can do. Thanks for coming all the way over here.')
('Bracer Alvis', "I know you're here due to business with the Verne<br/>Company, but you should avoid any suspicious moves<br/>while you're at it.")
('Van', "Got it, milord. We'll be sure to follow your lead and<br/>be on our best behavior.")
('Bracer Alvis', 'You can start with axing the snark!')
('Bracer Regina', '*sigh* Here we go again... Well, see you<br/>later, everyone.')
('Agnès', '*sigh* Did you have to pick a fight with them when<br/>they just helped us out?')
('Van', "It's fine. We're better off keepin' the guild at arm's<br/>length while we're here.")
('Quatre', 'Well, let me just say again that I really do appreciate<br/>you coming to my rescue.')
('Quatre', 'But was there something you needed me for when<br/>you called me earlier?')
('Van', 'Oh, yeah. Almost forgot.')
('Agnès', 'There was something we wanted to discuss with<br/>you, actually...')
('Quatre', "So you want to go inside the Institute of Science,<br/>do you? You're right that only Agnès has the<br/>authority to do that.")
('Quatre', "And I wish I could help all of you get through with<br/>her, but I can't upgrade your card. You'd need to<br/>speak to—")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', 'This guy right here! Lemme see your card.')
(40000, 'Received C-rank ID certification.')
('Feri', 'Oh! The writing on it changed!')
('Agnès', "You're C-rank just like me now...which means you<br/>can go inside the institute!")
('Van', "We really owe you one. You sure it's okay to do stuff<br/>like this without runnin' it by that CEO first, though?")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Basel's run by three groups: the Verne Company, the<br/>Institute of Science, and the Artisans' Guild.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "I'm the head of the third one, so I don't need<br/>anyone's approval but my own for stuff like this.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "'Sides, you saved the professor's favorite youngin'.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "I wouldn't be fit to call myself an artisan of Basel if I<br/>didn't find some way to thank you.")
('Quatre', 'Supervisor...')
('Van', "Can't argue with that. Thanks a lot.")
('Van', 'Just outta curiosity, is C as far as you can upgrade<br/>our card?')
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Hahaha! You got guts on you, kid! You call yourself a<br/>'spriggan,' right?")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Can't say I'd peg you as the squeaky-clean type, but<br/>I've got a feelin' you can do some good work where<br/>the guild can't.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "I can bump your card's rank up to a B if I feel like<br/>you've earned it. So keep up the good work.")
('Aaron', "I thought he'd be more of a stubborn old mule, but<br/>he's more lax than I gave him credit for.")
('Feri', "Aww. I think it's more he just trusts us a little.")
('Quatre', 'Well, his trust in you makes me feel better about<br/>helping you, too.')
('Quatre', "That card's all you need to get into the institute, but<br/>how about I show you the way there?")
('Quatre', 'Think of it as my way of saying thank you for<br/>saving me.')
('FIO', 'Are you leaving, Quatre?')
('Quatre', "I am, but you're coming with.")
('Quatre', "Thanks for the help earlier, XEROS. Could you take<br/>care of things here while I'm gone?")
('XEROS', 'RUFF.')
('Agnès', "So their names are FIO and XEROS?<br/>They're amazing...")
('Feri', "Yeah. They're like loyal animal friends straight out of<br/>a fairy tale!")
('Aaron', 'The black one looks rad, in my opinion.')
('Quatre', "I'm glad you can appreciate their brilliance.")
('Risette', "They are autonomous orbal drones based on holo<br/>AIs, if I recall? I've heard about the technology<br/>involved to create them.")
('Risette', "I didn't expect to see both a floating support type and<br/>a ground-based offensive type while in the<br/>field, however.")
('Quatre', "You're...very well informed.")
('Risette', "My apologies for not introducing myself sooner. I am<br/>Risette Twinings, and I'm a concierge for Marduk<br/>Total Security Company.")
('Risette', "I'm currently supporting Arkride Solutions in<br/>their endeavors.")
('Quatre', 'Well, that explains how you know so much.')
('Quatre', "But hold on. Didn't you say this request was from...?")
('Quatre', "I thought Marduk's sponsors were covertly at odds<br/>with the principality...")
('Quatre', '...so how did you end up establishing such a bizarre<br/>group like this?')
('Van', 'I ask myself the same thing every day...')
('Agnès', 'Ahaha...')
('Aaron', 'Might as well resign yourself to your fate.')
('Feri', "It was clearly Arusha's guidance that brought<br/>us together!")
('Risette', "That and Mr. Arkride's personal magnetism.")
('Van', 'How am I getting bundled with the Goddess here?!')
('Quatre', "(I guess I'll just have to let it go for now...)")
('Quatre', "Anyway, the aerotram boarding platform is this way.<br/>You'll be able to use it now that your card's<br/>been upgraded.")
('Feri', "Wow! We're so high up!")
('Aaron', 'Heh. This is kinda nice.')
('Van', "It's the kinda thing you'd only find here.<br/>Professor Hamilton designed this, right?")
('Quatre', "Oh! I'm impressed you knew!")
('Agnès', 'Is something wrong?')
('Risette', "Not at all. It's just that while I've heard about<br/>everything here...")
('Risette', '...seeing the whole world with your own eyes for the<br/>first time is without doubt an unparalleled experience.')
('Agnès', '...? I know what you mean. I feel the same way<br/>after diving into the world of a good book for<br/>the first time.')
('Agnès', "Well, we'll be going back to our hotel now.")
('Van', "Sure thing. Try not to stay up too late just 'cause no<br/>one's keepin' an eye on you.")
('Odette', "That telescope was AMAZING though, wasn't it?<br/>I wish we could've had another look through it before<br/>we left!")
('Odette', "How about you come and walk around with us some<br/>on the last day, Feri? We'd love to have you!")
('Feri', "Really? Your work sounds amazing, so I'd like that<br/>a lot!")
('Aaron', "I'll just leave playtime to the kids, then.")
('Aaron', "I'm more in the market for a place catered to adults.<br/>Hell, you wanna join in on the fun, four-eyes?")
('Albert', '*gulp* I-I would never want to go to such a place!')
('Odette', "Haha! That sounds like it'd be kinda fun in its<br/>own way.")
('Odette', 'It was nice to finally meet the famous Risette, too.<br/>Maybe we could talk some more another... Hmm?')
('Risette', 'Oh, yes. I would like that very much indeed.')
('Odette', "Yay! Then it's happening!")
('Renne', '(...Did you notice?)')
('Van', '(Yeah. You manage to learn anything on your end?)')
('Renne', "(I'm afraid not. We heard something interesting from<br/>that genius professor, but that's about it.)")
('Renne', "(I'm not going to have much free time here, however,<br/>so I'm going to have to leave it to that nose of yours<br/>this time. ♪)")
('Van', "(Dumpin' all the work on me, huh? Great.)")
('Renne', "Ah, here's the tram. Then we bid you all farewell.")
('Agnès', "I should be able to meet you tomorrow morning at<br/>around eight o'clock.")
('Agnès', "I know it's a little early for good nights, but I hope you<br/>all have one regardless.")
('Van', 'Same to you. See ya tomorrow.')
('Feri', 'Sleep tight!')
('Aaron', "So what's eating away at you, phony maid?")
('Risette', '...Huh?')
('Feri', 'Hmm? Is something up?')
('Van', "(...Can't hide a thing from him.)")
('Risette', "...Haha. I should have realized I wouldn't be able to<br/>keep my concerns a secret.")
('Risette', "To tell you the truth, I'm getting a peculiar sense of<br/>déjà vu from what's happening here in Basel.")
('Feri', 'Déjà vu?')
('Van', "Your main job's being a concierge, but you also<br/>handle crisis management all over the country, right?")
('Van', 'So which does this orbal net and distribution network<br/>issue make you think of more:')
('Van', 'Liberl six years ago, or Crossbell four years ago?')
('Risette', "...You're proving perceptive and knowledgeable<br/>beyond belief.")
('Feri', "Hmm? I'm sure I've heard both of those things<br/>before, but...")
('Aaron', "Yeah, I think Cao's mentioned them at some<br/>point, too.")
('Van', 'The former was when all orbal power was shut off by<br/>the appearance of an ancient floating city.')
('Van', 'The latter was when the orbal network was used to<br/>perform a manmade miracle.')
('Van', "I never witnessed 'em firsthand, so there's a lot of<br/>gaps in what I know...")
('Van', "...but both were caused by things you wouldn't think<br/>could exist.")
('Aaron', "Man, I'd think you'd made both events up if I didn't<br/>know better.")
('Aaron', "I know what happened a year and a half ago in<br/>Crossbell, and that's just as batshit crazy on paper.")
('Feri', 'Oh, when the whole continent was...hacked, or<br/>whatever the word is?')
('Risette', "I'm afraid I can't answer most of your questions<br/>because they would contain classified information.")
('Risette', 'However, I believe this may end with a crisis different<br/>from the ones that Mr. Arkride mentioned.')
('Feri', 'Huh...')
('Aaron', "Well, Miss Perfect's Genesis started glowing again.<br/>There's bound to be something.")
('Aaron', 'No way this ends without giving us a headache.')
('Van', "Yeah. We're gonna need to be ready for trouble.")
('Van', "You gotta head out somewhere now, right? I'll come<br/>with you if you want.")
('Risette', 'Again, you are perceptive beyond belief.')
('Van', "We might've only met in person recently, but I've<br/>known you for a real long time now.")
('Van', "Whenever you stumble on a major problem brewin',<br/>you gotta report it to HQ, right?")
('Risette', 'Correct. What is happening here certainly falls under<br/>Code E of our regulations—but I see no harm in<br/>having someone with me during my report.')
('Risette', 'We could also patrol the area at the same time.<br/>Does that sound all right?')
('Van', "More than all right. Let's get goin'.")
('Feri', 'W-Wait!')
('Aaron', "It's not just you two here, y'know. Don't even think<br/>of leaving us out.")
('Van', "I don't mind takin' one of you, but the other's gonna<br/>have to stay behind.")
('Van', "Someone'll need to be available if Agnès or that boy<br/>we met decide to call.")
('Feri', 'Right. That makes sense...')
('Aaron', "Fine. Then c'mon: who are you taking?")
('System', 'Select one additional member to accompany Van<br/>and Risette. They can be swapped out later using the<br/>computer in the hotel room.')
('Feri', 'So where do you have to go to give your report?')
('Feri', "Your company's headquarters isn't even in Calvard,<br/>is it?")
('Aaron', 'So where do we have to go to even give this report?')
('Aaron', "Your company HQ's so far away, I would've thought<br/>you'd just call them.")
('Risette', "There's a bit of a process involved for security reasons.<br/>For starters, we need to leave the city toward<br/>the canyon.")
('Risette', "This needn't take priority over any other work you<br/>would like to do, however.")
('Van', '(I see now...)')
('Van', "Got it. We'll head over once we've walked around a<br/>little, then.")
('Quatre', 'Wow...')
('Professor Cronkite', '...I see now.')
('Professor Cronkite', 'Analyze this device for us, Quatre.')
('Quatre', 'Can I touch it?')
('Agnès', 'Yes, of course.')
('Quatre', "Judging by the way it's aged, I wouldn't even say it's<br/>anywhere close to being a century old—so definitely<br/>not an artifact.")
('Quatre', "All these buttons and indicators make the front look<br/>obtuse at first, but it's all organized and looks to serve<br/>a clear purpose.")
('Quatre', 'From my perspective, it resembles more the original<br/>generation of orbments back when they were based<br/>off of clocks.')
('Quatre', "It's significantly more complex than any of<br/>those, however. This here is the work of a genius.")
('Quatre', 'W-Wait... Could this have been made by...?')
('Professor Cronkite', 'A commendable effort.')
('Professor Cronkite', 'It is one of the experimental devices that my own<br/>master was involved in developing, leading to the<br/>establishment of orbment technology.')
('Professor Cronkite', 'One of the eight orbment prototypes developed by<br/>Professor C. Epstein.')
('Professor Cronkite', 'They are called the Eight Geneses.')
('Professor Cronkite', 'I was not aware they were still in existence.')
('Quatre', "I can't believe I'm touching an orbment designed by<br/>Professor Epstein...")
('Quatre', 'How did you come to have something like<br/>this, Agnès?')
('Agnès', 'I...')
('Van', "Sorry, but we're gonna have to stay tight-lipped on<br/>that one—even if you are connected to one of the<br/>three disciples.")
('Van', "Like we said before showing it to you, we're countin'<br/>on you guys to keep their existence a secret.")
('Professor Cronkite', 'I will be true to my word.')
('Professor Cronkite', "And it does help me understand what you're doing<br/>here in Basel now.")
('Professor Cronkite', "Now, it's time I compensated you for what you have<br/>shown us.")
('Professor Cronkite', "You wanted to know about Professor Callaghan's<br/>research, correct?")
('Van', "Yeah. We've heard he was the one who developed the<br/>weaponry that's being used by Calvard at<br/>the moment.")
('Van', "So whatever he's trying to develop right now has to<br/>do with military tech, too?")
('Professor Cronkite', 'You are indeed correct regarding what he achieved,<br/>but he is a researcher of engineering science first<br/>and foremost.')
('Professor Cronkite', "In a sense, he is currently grappling with one of that<br/>field's most difficult challenges:")
('Professor Cronkite', 'The realization of a certain thought experiment...and<br/>the use of the physical phenomena involved<br/>as weapons.')
('Quatre', '...!')
('Feri', "What's a thought experiment?")
('Aaron', 'Oh?')
('Risette', "(It couldn't be...)")
('Professor Cronkite', "Ah, yes. It doesn't surprise me in the least that<br/>someone from Marduk would have heard of that to<br/>which I am referring.")
('Professor Cronkite', 'Of course, the existence of such weapons is<br/>purely theoretical. It is impossible to create them<br/>using modern technology.')
('Professor Cronkite', 'Not without a discovery so groundbreaking that it<br/>fundamentally upends what is possible.')
('Professor Cronkite', 'Well, then, I have said all I intend to. Now I must<br/>return to work.')
('Aaron', 'Hey!')
('Feri', "I'm not following any of this...")
('Professor Cronkite', "I don't believe in discussing the research of others at<br/>length publicly until it has been published.")
('Professor Cronkite', "I've given you all of the information that the antique<br/>you showed me justifies.")
('Professor Cronkite', "Quatre will enlighten you on the rest, I'm sure.")
('Van', "So that's where he draws the line as a researcher, huh?")
('Quatre', 'This is very like him.')
('Agnès', 'So are you able to pick up where he left off?')
('Aaron', "Yeah. What's this thought experiment he was<br/>talking about?")
('Quatre', 'Well...')
('Quatre', 'I remember hearing about this from Professors<br/>Callaghan and Hamilton a long time ago.')
('Quatre', 'About a theoretical form of tech in which the smallest<br/>units of matter would create a fusion reaction,<br/>producing a massive amount of energy.')
('Quatre', 'Such diabolical weapons cannot be created—but if<br/>they could, the consequences could be unthinkable.')
('Quatre', 'They are often referred to as nuclear weapons.')
('Feri', 'What an ominous idea...')
('Agnès', 'I could barely understand your explanation, but just<br/>hearing it sent a chill down my spine.')
('Aaron', 'Yeah, you can say that again.')
('Van', '...')
('Risette', 'Their existence is purely theoretical. No one has ever<br/>come close to creating such a thing.')
('Risette', 'The predictive simulations that Marduk has run rate<br/>their probability of being realized anytime soon as<br/>extremely low.')
('Risette', "Parallel-distributed computing alone isn't going to be<br/>enough to get over the insurmountable hurdles that<br/>stand in its way.")
('Quatre', 'Agreed. Even if whatever was at work behind the<br/>scenes in Crossbell a year and a half ago was the<br/>one involved.')
('Quatre', 'Professor Callaghan would know all of this, too, so if<br/>he really is still trying...')
('Van', 'That makes it even harder to guess where he<br/>could be.')
('Agnès', 'But we still have to find him! Whatever it takes!')
('Van', "The aerotrams are all at a stop. We'll have to take the<br/>road instead.")
('Aaron', "Then let's get to it!")
('Agnès', "We'll have to keep a close eye out as we go.<br/>There might still be people who need our help!")
('Aaron', "This is cinnamon coffee, huh? Kinda has a different<br/>fragrance to it, but it's not bad.")
('Quatre', "The professor's a big fan of it, so I've had it a lot.<br/>I've heard it's pretty popular over in the Central East.")
('Feri', 'Yeah! I drank it a lot back at home. Always with<br/>milk, though.')
('Agnès', 'I could see myself getting addicted to this fragrance.')
('Van', "It pairs perfectly with the chocolate, too! We've got<br/>ourselves a little slice of heaven here. ♪")
('Aaron', 'Will someone put a sock in this guy already?')
('Quatre', "You're a big fan of sweet things, huh? You seemed to<br/>like the engadin, too.")
('Agnès', "He can't help himself, I'm afraid.")
('Quatre', "It feels so strange to have this place be so lively again.<br/>I've been the only one here for so long now.")
('Quatre', 'Yang and Essy are so busy with their work that they<br/>can only afford to drop by every once in a blue moon<br/>these days.')
('Agnès', "That's too bad...")
('Van', 'So you were still really young when you were adopted<br/>by the professor?')
('Quatre', "That's right—though I'd rather skip how it<br/>came about.")
('Quatre', "Even though we're not related by blood, she's treated<br/>me like a real grandchild.")
('Quatre', 'As soon as I started taking an interest in technology<br/>and absorbing anything I could, she would always<br/>find time in her busy schedule to teach me.')
('Quatre', 'After that, I started visiting the observatory a lot<br/>because that was where she did her research.')
('Quatre', 'My interest in astronomy then led to Yang and Essy<br/>teaching me all kinds of things along with her.')
('Quatre', 'I was a complete nobody...and yet they chose to make<br/>me part of their family.')
('Agnès', 'They seem like absolutely lovely people.')
('Feri', "I can see why you're so desperate to protect<br/>everything they left behind in their absence.")
('Quatre', "...But I've failed. The Aurora was destroyed, Risette<br/>suffered just to keep me safe...")
('Quatre', "I don't know how I'm going to be able to face the<br/>professor when she comes home.")
('Van', "Like Risette said, there's a lot of people around who<br/>love you.")
('Van', 'This might be a good time to learn to lean on them a<br/>little more.')
('FIO', 'You are not alone, Quatre.')
('XEROS', 'RUFF.')
('Quatre', "Yeah... I'm coming to realize that, too.")
('Quatre', "I thought I'd learned that lesson when we all came<br/>together to finish FIO and XEROS, but apparently I<br/>was a few steps away.")
('Quatre', "I could never have done that on my own. It took<br/>Gran's help, Yang and Essy's help...")
('Quatre', 'Even Professor Callaghan played a pivotal role in<br/>getting the job done.')
('Feri', 'Really?')
('Agnès', 'Professor Callaghan helped make your orbal drones?')
('Aaron', "I remember hearing that he used to stop by here<br/>despite being Hamilton's rival, but it's still hard<br/>to imagine.")
('Quatre', "You all only know him as he is now, but like I said<br/>yesterday, he wasn't always like that.")
('Quatre', "He was the leading figure in the field of<br/>engineering science. He even designed a whole lot of<br/>the current Republican Army's weaponry.")
('Quatre', 'He used to be something of a rival to Professor<br/>Hamilton and us, but both sides fully respected one<br/>another and took it as a way for all of us to grow.')
('Quatre', 'It was because Professor Callaghan and Professor<br/>Hamilton joined forces that they were able to create<br/>the Aurora, too—')
('Quatre', 'Actually...')
('Agnès', 'Wh-What is it?')
('Feri', 'Why did he run off?')
('Quatre', 'I found it!')
('Feri', 'Hmm? That looks a lot like the Aurora.')
('Van', 'Yeah. Not exactly the same, but pretty damn close.')
('Quatre', "It is. It's part of another idea that was considered<br/>during the planning stages for the Aurora.")
('Quatre', 'It was to be one half of a twin-core system that was<br/>modeled after the left and right sides of the<br/>human brain.')
('Quatre', 'The two systems would perform totally different<br/>calculations in tandem with one another, much like<br/>our brains do.')
('Quatre', 'In the end, budgetary constraints meant that only the<br/>Aurora was completed, but a prototype version of the<br/>other system was made!')
('Aaron', 'So then...')
('Agnès', "Then there's effectively a prototype of the central<br/>computer from yesterday out there somewhere?")
('Van', "...I did think it was weird that they'd destroy the<br/>Aurora, considerin' their endgame.")
('Van', "But if Professor Callaghan was one of the developers<br/>behind the whole project, it'd make sense if he gave<br/>'em that prototype, too.")
('Quatre', "If we assume that is the case, that'll significantly help<br/>in narrowing down where it could be now!")
('Quatre', 'Could you give me a hand finding the other<br/>documents we have on it here?')
('Feri', 'Of course!')
('Agnès', 'Just tell us what you want us to do!')
('Aaron', 'I GUESS I can put the work in.')
('Aaron', "But if you can't pinpoint where the thing is after we<br/>find all the stuff you want, we're gonna force you to<br/>run butt-naked through Basel.")
('Quatre', 'Yeah, yeah. Whatever.')
('Quatre', 'Agnès, I need you to find a map of the septium veins<br/>in this area—')
('Aaron', 'Tch. He sure picked himself up fast.')
('Van', "He's a hell of a lot more grown up than you are, that's<br/>for sure.")
('Quatre', "Oort Abandoned Factory. I think that's our place.")
('Van', "That's the place where a lot of the research leadin' to<br/>the last generation of gunships was done, right?")
('Van', "The area was sealed off a while ago because it was so<br/>worn down, but you really think we're gonna find our<br/>target there?")
('Quatre', "I'd say the odds are about 87%—no, 90%.")
('Quatre', 'I tried taking the waveforms of the distortions in the<br/>orbal and energy supply networks, then combining<br/>them with that map of the septium veins.')
('Quatre', "The only place that matches that data, is big and<br/>quiet enough to hide a device of the Aurora's size...")
('Quatre', '...and is still close enough to Basel to interfere with<br/>the orbal network. Nowhere else is as good a match<br/>as this.')
('Aaron', "That's some confidence.")
('Agnès', "But I don't think it's misplaced. This area matches<br/>everything we know so far!")
('Feri', 'An abandoned factory far from civilization seems like<br/>the perfect place for Almata to use as a hideout.')
('Quatre', 'Wh-What are you doing?')
('Van', "Congratulatin' you on a job well done.")
('Van', "I'm sure even that genius professor would be<br/>impressed by your efforts here.")
('Quatre', "Haha... I wouldn't be so sure about that.")
('Quatre', "It's just a guess right now. We won't know for sure<br/>until we make our way over there.")
('Aaron', "Well, we've come this far. Time to finish this leg of<br/>the race.")
('Feri', "I agree! It's 2PM already, so we don't have<br/>much time.")
('Agnès', "I think we should let Renne, the guild, and the CID<br/>know what we're doing.")
('Quatre', 'The abandoned road leading to the factory is on the<br/>bottom level of New Town—on the other side of a<br/>locked gate.')
('Quatre', "My certification card will get us through it. I'm ready<br/>to leave as soon as you all are.")
('Van', "Got it. We'll head on over as soon as we're<br/>ready, then.")
('System', 'They informed Renne, the guild, and the CID that<br/>they were going to make their way to Oort<br/>Abandoned Road.')
('Receptionist Alex', "Well, if it isn't Van! Surprised to see you taking a<br/>business trip this time of year.")
('Van', "Yeah. Client came in with a big job, so we're out here<br/>takin' care of that.")
('Van', "Looks like you're movin' on up in the world, too.<br/>Last I saw, you were a part-timer still in school, and<br/>now you're the receptionist?")
('Receptionist Alex', 'Yup, yup. They hired me here fresh out of college.')
('Aaron', "He another acquaintance of yours? You've got friends<br/>in all sorts of places.")
('Receptionist Alex', "Oh, we're just in the same field. We worked together<br/>on a job a while back.")
('Receptionist Alex', 'Zin was actually telling me about you the other day!<br/>He said that we should be fine contracting you for<br/>help if we need to.')
('Receptionist Alex', 'I heard the same from a friend of mine outside<br/>the guild.')
('Receptionist Alex', "If something serious goes down, there's no shame in<br/>us working together.")
('Feri', 'Oh? Who?')
('Van', "(René or Kilika, I'm guessin'...)")
('Van', "I swear, I can't walk five arge without people draggin'<br/>me into their business. I ain't a bracer, y'know?")
('Receptionist Alex', 'Oh, speaking of which...')
('Bracer Alvis', "Y-You're...!")
('Agnès', 'Alvis! Regina!')
('Receptionist Alex', 'Haha. Speak of the devils.')
('Risette', 'These two bracers work in Edith, correct?')
('Bracer Regina', "Hey there. I didn't think I'd run into you guys here.")
('Aaron', "Oh, man. Don't tell me we all got shipped out here<br/>on behalf of the same guy?")
('Bracer Alvis', "*sigh* Obviously not. I have no idea why you're even<br/>here, but we're here on official orders from the guild,<br/>not an individual client.")
('Bracer Alvis', "And wherever you guys go, trouble seems to follow...<br/>I think it's making me superstitious, not gonna lie.")
('Bracer Alvis', "Hopefully that's not the case here.")
('Van', "Man, I don't enjoy it any more than you do.<br/>Stop framin' it like I'm the one at fault.")
('Van', "I'm just doin' my job and puttin' food on the table.")
('Van', "Surely a C-rank bracer's got better things to worry<br/>about than some spriggan, so stop lettin' me live rent<br/>free in your head, yeah?")
('Bracer Alvis', "...Smartass. I swear, this is why I can't stand you.<br/>You're always just...")
('Bracer Alvis', "Bah, forget it! Just don't get up in our business,<br/>got it?!")
('Bracer Regina', "E-Erm, I know he's a bit abrasive with you, but I do<br/>think he respects your abilities.")
('Bracer Regina', "If you come across anything, just let us know—you're<br/>doing work for the guild anyway, so we might as well<br/>share intel.")
('Aaron', "Funny way for him to show 'respect,' but well, you do<br/>you, bracer boy.")
('Van', "I'm not too worried about him. If we need the guild<br/>to lend a hand, we'll ask for it. For now, we got our<br/>own business to focus on.")
('Feri', "This must be the aerotram station. I can't believe<br/>it goes all the way up in the sky...!")
('Agnès', "That's right. This'll take us to New Town in no time.")
('Agnès', 'All you need to do is hold your certification card over<br/>the ticket gate.')
('Van', "Oh. Guess we're not takin' this one after all.")
('Risette', "Our D-rank card isn't accepted on this<br/>aerotram, apparently. We need a C-rank card<br/>or higher.")
('Agnès', "Are you sure? I could've sworn we had a C...")
('Aaron', "Way to roll out the welcome mat when we're here<br/>for Elsaim. Would it kill them to throw one of their<br/>biggest stakeholders a bone?")
('Feri', 'I was really looking forward to it, too...')
('Van', "Well, no use cryin' over spilled milk.")
('Van', "You can head on up if you want, Agnès. We'll just<br/>take the long way.")
('Agnès', "No, it's all right. I'd rather stick together.")
('Agnès', "I'm sure we'll get to ride the tram another day, Feri.<br/>Don't let it get you down!")
('Feri', "You're right, yeah.")
('Van', 'Well, this was where we saw Willy last night...')
('Van', "...but sure enough, he's long gone.")
('Agnès', "Nadir said that Willy was here until late last night,<br/>but there's no trace of him left.")
('Agnès', "I guess it only makes sense that he'd have moved<br/>by now.")
('Deliveryman Jason', "Hey there. You guys looking for Willy's café?")
('Van', 'You could say that, yeah.')
('Deliveryman Jason', 'I was eating at his place when he was here last night.')
('Deliveryman Jason', 'After I finished my meal, he closed up shop and went<br/>off toward New Town.')
('Deliveryman Jason', "If I had to guess, he's probably over there today, or<br/>close to it.")
('Deliveryman Jason', "You can never be sure with him, guy's a real free bird.<br/>But that's as good a guess as any.")
('Van', "Got'cha... Now that you mention it, he was over there<br/>this time yesterday, too.")
('Aaron', "Sucks he doesn't stick to a schedule...but maybe he<br/>does have a pattern.")
('Risette', 'We might also find people there who have seen the<br/>café more recently.')
('Risette', 'This is our most probable lead, so I recommend we<br/>take a look.')
('Van', "Sounds good. Let's head on over to that hotel where<br/>we saw him yesterday, and then we can go from there.")
('Van', 'Thanks for the help, man.')
('Deliveryman Jason', "No problem! Not sure what you're tracking him down<br/>for, but best of luck regardless!")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "Th-They're inside the building! Chief, whatever do<br/>we do?")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Bastards... Fight 'em back! Pick up anything that'd<br/>put a dent in 'em! Pipes, wrenches, just<br/>find something!")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "We'll show 'em why you don't pick a bone<br/>with engineers!")
(40301, "Y-You can't be serious! We don't stand a chance!")
('Van', "The man's right! Leave the fightin' to us!")
('Quatre', 'Chief...and Essy?! Why are you here, too?!')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "Quatre! Oh, I'm so glad you're all saaafe!")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', 'Boy, am I glad to see you guys!')
('Feri', "We'll take down the archaisms!")
('Risette', 'Initiating combat!')
('Agnès', 'Is anybody hurt?')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "Oh, nooo, we're all okay.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', 'Whew... We really owe ya one.')
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "There's a ton of uber-expensive testing<br/>equipment here. We'd have had hell to pay if they'd<br/>broken any of it.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "How's it looking outside?")
('Aaron', 'Same as here: cloudy with a chance of robots.')
('Risette', 'The police and Bracer Guild are undoubtedly sending<br/>reinforcements. They should have most areas under<br/>control soon enough.')
('Quatre', "The problem is communication: they're jamming the<br/>entire city. We can't get the word out anywhere...")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Then I've got just the thing.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "We got this emergency line here, and it's completely<br/>off the grid. We run it through our own system.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', 'That should let us call in help, and then we can start<br/>pushing these bastards back!')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "I'll give you a hand, too!")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "I probably can't dispel it entirely, but I should be able<br/>to counter the interference enough to get some<br/>messages out.")
('Quatre', "I mean...maybe, but I'd really rather you get yourself<br/>to safety.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "She's safe here, don't worry. Our front door's a<br/>goddamn bulwark.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "We'll lower it and hunker down if we need to.<br/>That'll buy us all the time we could want.")
('Quatre', 'If you insist... Just please be careful.')
('Quatre', "We're headed for the observatory—that's what they<br/>seem to be after.")
('Quatre', "The professor cared deeply for the place... I won't let<br/>them ruin it!")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Made up your mind, huh? I can see it on your face—<br/>there's no way I'm talking you outta that.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', 'Just be careful. You guys take care of him, all right?')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'We leave Quatre and the observatory in your hands!')
('Van', 'You got it.')
('System', 'Earned')
('Heidi', 'Wh-Where did all of these things COME from?!<br/>Someone, help!')
('Barnaby', "We're so close to the church, too...!")
('Barnaby', 'What are monsters doing here, of all places...?!<br/>How many of them are there?!')
('Agnès', 'Those people need help over there!')
('Quatre', "It's Heidi and Barnaby!")
('Heidi', 'Quatre?! I-Is that you?')
('Quatre', "We'll distract them! Please, get yourselves to safety<br/>while we cover you!")
('Van', 'Get her out of here, bud!')
('Barnaby', 'A-All right. Come on, quick!')
('Feri', 'Good, it looks like they made it to the church.')
('Agnès', "That's a relief. But that means there are still people<br/>outside caught in the crossfire...")
('Aaron', "They're going after the kids and elderly, too...<br/>Chickenshit rust buckets.")
('Van', "It was bad enough inside Giscard's building. Anybody<br/>outside is up shit creek without a paddle here.")
('Van', "If we find anybody else out there, we'll help 'em to<br/>the church or the inn, whichever's closer.")
('Van', 'That should be safer than the workshop, at least—no<br/>heavy equipment for the archaisms to target there.')
('Van', "I doubt those two are the only ones we'll find.")
('Van', 'Gang, keep an eye out for anyone else who<br/>needs help.')
('System', 'Earned')
('Sasha', "W-We're cornered...!")
('Millia', "They're coming from the institute, too...?!")
('Stinson', "This isn't looking good...")
('Julian', "If only I'd brought my sword... Damn this! Sasha, I'm<br/>going to have to take a risk here.")
('Sasha', "Wait, no! Julian, don't do it! I know you're trained,<br/>but—")
('Van', "No need for the heroics! We got'cha!")
('Quatre', 'There are people there! Quick!')
('Agnès', 'Julian! Sasha! Are you okay?!')
('Sasha', "A-Agnès! We're fine, but...")
('Julian', "You're her work colleagues from yesterday!")
('Van', 'Leave these things to us!')
('Agnès', 'Keep those two safe for us while we fend them off!')
('Sasha', 'G-Got it!')
('Julian', 'Be careful!')
('Stinson', 'We owe you our lives... Thank you so much.')
('Julian', "I don't want to even think about what would've<br/>happened had you not been there. It was looking<br/>awfully dire.")
('Agnès', 'Were you two helping them out?')
('Sasha', 'Trying to, at least. We were rounding people up<br/>inside the inn, but then we heard screaming from<br/>outside, so we went back out again.')
('Julian', 'We picked up those two...and that was when those<br/>monsters jumped us.')
('Julian', "I should have been able to fend them off myself,<br/>but I... Damn it, I'm pathetic!")
('Millia', "Don't blame yourself! We wouldn't have made it<br/>this far without you.")
('Agnès', 'I agree. We only made it in time because you held<br/>them off.')
('Sasha', "Either way, now's not the time to think about all that!<br/>We've gotta keep doing what we can now.")
('Sasha', "Oh, we got in touch with Renne, too. We've kept her<br/>in the loop and gathered all the students we<br/>could here.")
('Agnès', 'Ah! Yeah, we saw her earlier, too.')
('Agnès', 'New Town is in good hands with her helping there.<br/>You two take care of yourselves!')
('Sasha', "We will! We just don't wanna leave anybody behind!")
('Quatre', "We're directing everyone to the inn or the<br/>church, right?")
('Quatre', 'We were just in that area ourselves.')
('Van', 'Yeah. Managed to thin out their numbers a lot, too.<br/>Those two places should be safe for the time being.')
('Julian', "All right. Then let's make our way back ASAP!")
('Julian', "I'm sure Lyle and Chignon are worried about us both.")
('Sasha', 'Take care, everyone!')
('Millia', 'Thanks again for your help!')
('Quatre', "Phew... I'm glad we decided to stop by when we did.<br/>I dread to imagine what would've<br/>happened otherwise...")
('Risette', 'They mentioned that archaisms are spreading from<br/>the institute, though... That concerns me.')
('Van', "Yeah. By now, the place is probably crawlin' with 'em.")
('Van', "Hell, probably even worse there than it is outside.<br/>Whatever Almata wants, it's in the institute.")
('Quatre', "I really hope everyone's okay... Please be safe, Yang!")
('System', 'Earned')
('Feri', 'Oh! There he is!')
('Quatre', "I'm glad we didn't have to go on a wild goose chase to<br/>find you today.")
('Professor Cronkite', "Ah, if it isn't the spriggan. You look like you have<br/>something more to discuss with me.")
('Van', 'Damn right, we do.')
('Quatre', "I imagine you're already privy to the situation, so we<br/>don't need to bring you up to speed.")
('Quatre', "Right now, we're trying to get everything under<br/>control ourselves before the government intervenes<br/>any further.")
('Quatre', "So that's why we wanted to ask you about—")
('Professor Cronkite', 'Me? What exactly do I have to do with all this?')
('Quatre', 'Erm...')
('Professor Cronkite', 'I will admit my curiosity is piqued by the<br/>developments here.')
('Professor Cronkite', "Marduk is an interesting wrinkle in the story, as are<br/>Professor Callaghan's...shall we say,<br/>inadvisable efforts.")
('Professor Cronkite', 'I do plan to stay and watch how this all pans out, but<br/>as I said yesterday—')
('Quatre', '*sigh* Can you at least let me finish before<br/>dismissing me?')
('Quatre', "I've had to face a lot of hard truths over the past<br/>few days.")
('Quatre', "I've been made to realize just how lacking I am and<br/>how much I still have to learn.")
('Quatre', "I know that it's impossible to rectify all of that<br/>overnight, but there are still things I want to protect<br/>no matter the cost.")
('Quatre', "All I want is for your feedback on a hypothesis<br/>of mine. I won't ask for any more of your help<br/>than that.")
('Professor Cronkite', '...Go on.')
('Quatre', 'Professor Callaghan all but lives on the network now.')
('Quatre', "But that goal of his contradicts the actions he took.<br/>One thing doesn't add up to me.")
('Quatre', 'Why did he simply let the mafia destroy the Aurora?')
('Van', '...!')
('Agnès', "That's a good question...")
('Professor Cronkite', '...I agree. That is an obvious contradiction.')
('Professor Cronkite', "If they intend to use weapons of mass destruction,<br/>they must figure out how to invent and produce<br/>them—they simply don't exist yet.")
('Professor Cronkite', "Professor Callaghan's AI only solves one part of the<br/>problem. Even with functional blueprints, there are no<br/>means to produce them.")
('Professor Cronkite', 'The AI is essential in their research efforts—it holds<br/>more computational power than any other machine<br/>in Basel.')
('Professor Cronkite', 'And if they no longer have it, that begs<br/>another question...')
('Quatre', 'How will they produce these nuclear weapons<br/>without the means to invent them?')
('Professor Cronkite', 'An astute observation.')
('Aaron', "Can't say no, can you? Something tells me you<br/>wanted to help him out all along, in spite of your<br/>crotchety old man act.")
('Professor Cronkite', 'I am simply giving him the feedback he requested.')
('Professor Cronkite', "It will be up to him to prove his theory—though<br/>judging from what I've heard so far, he'll find the<br/>answers soon enough.")
('Quatre', 'Yang...')
('Professor Cronkite', "You are correct: people do not grow and<br/>change overnight. But having watched you, I can see<br/>how you've matured over the years.")
('Professor Cronkite', 'I look forward to seeing you grow into a well-rounded<br/>scientist, just as Professor Hamilton did.')
('Quatre', '...Thank you. I will.')
('Feri', 'He really is like a brother to you, huh?')
('Van', "He's more helpful than he wants to admit.<br/>Curious where he's goin' after he leaves Basel, but I<br/>guess that ain't my business.")
('Quatre', "I agree...and besides, it's not our place to tell him how<br/>to live his life.")
('Quatre', 'We need to focus on our own work right now.')
('Agnès', "You're right.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', 'Give it another look! Comb it real thorough<br/>this time!')
(40301, 'Y-Yes, chief!')
('Quatre', 'Is something wrong?')
('Van', 'Anything we can help with?')
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "I wish it was that simple, but nope. Ain't nothin' you<br/>folks can help with.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Guess it wouldn't hurt to fill you in, though...")
('Quatre', 'What?! Parts for that weapon prototype<br/>went missing?!')
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Yup. We found it out when we were looking into<br/>Callaghan's disappearance.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Most of the parts are still here—it's not like the<br/>whole thing up 'n' vanished.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "But there're little bits and pieces of our<br/>inventory missing. Our order sheets don't add up.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "And we haven't been able to find the missing<br/>parts anywhere.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "It's not just a few of 'em, either—we're missing huge<br/>chunks of inventory. Too much stuff to count.")
('Aaron', "Well, that's a bit alarming.")
('Feri', "You're talking about that weapon you showed us<br/>earlier, right?")
('Van', "Yeah, that definitely ain't good—and you're right, I<br/>dunno how we could help with that.")
('Van', 'Smells like an inside job to me. No way the<br/>world-famous Giscard Workshop just loses track of<br/>inventory like that.')
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Damn straight. A lot of us here know about the<br/>weapon, but it's still a highly confidential project.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "We've taken extra steps to make sure nothing<br/>gets out.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', 'And of all the times, this had to happen right after I<br/>went and mouthed off at Tausend. Shameful, I<br/>tell ya.')
('Quatre', "You order parts online, don't you? I remember you<br/>showing me how that system worked.")
('Quatre', "Do you think this inventory shortfall might be related<br/>to the network problems the city's been having?")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Our youngsters suggested the same thing. It's not<br/>entirely off the table, no.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', 'I just like to think we were being more careful<br/>than that. How could we not be, given everything<br/>going on?')
('Agnès', "That's understandable, yeah... I find it hard to believe<br/>it was just an accident, with how careful<br/>everyone's been. This feels premeditated.")
('Van', "Yeah. With all the weird shit goin' on, it's hard to<br/>chalk anything up to coincidence right now.")
('Feri', "There's just so much going on... We'll keep an eye<br/>out for any leads about your parts, though.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Thanks... Man, I'm sorry, folks. You've got enough<br/>on your plate without us and our stupid<br/>supply hiccups.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "We're still trying to find Callaghan, but we haven't<br/>got any good leads yet.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Our best guess is that he's somewhere off the<br/>beaten path. Mighta holed himself up somewhere on<br/>purpose, even.")
('Quatre', 'That does sound like a good guess.')
('Van', 'Well, if you learn anything, let us know.')
('Renne', "You couldn't have timed your arrival better.")
('Agnès', "Renne! We weren't expecting to find you here.")
('Van', "You want somethin' from us?")
('Renne', 'The opposite—I have something for you. A little<br/>piece of intel.')
('Bracer Alvis', '*sigh* Do you HAVE to go blabbing to them<br/>about it?')
('Aaron', "Hey, don't spoil her fun, killjoy. Ladies don't like<br/>a hardass.")
('Bracer Alvis', 'Excuse me?!')
('Bracer Regina', "*sigh* All right, boys, simmer down. Now's not the<br/>time for mouthing off.")
('Van', "So, what's this info about?")
('Renne', 'To the surprise of no one, Almata was behind the<br/>explosion in Anchorville.')
('Renne', "It sounds like it's a mess out there right now, after<br/>word got out that Almata had corporate help.")
('Bracer Alvis', 'Yeah. A lot of high-ranking bracers are stuck there<br/>right now trying to sort everything out.')
('Bracer Alvis', "Honestly, I'd really rather be out there right now, but<br/>we're tied up here.")
('Bracer Regina', "Yeah. After yesterday, we're not leaving<br/>anytime soon.")
('Renne', "Indeed. I'm still positive that the attack in<br/>Anchorville was just a diversion. Basel has to be their<br/>main target.")
('Renne', 'In fact, we know a little more about the agents who<br/>unleashed the archaisms in the city yesterday.')
('Renne', 'I strongly believe it was the same duo you met<br/>in Langport.')
('Aaron', 'Them again?!')
('Feri', 'Viola and Alexandre... They caused a ton of trouble<br/>back in Langport, too.')
('Quatre', "That's certainly not good...")
('Renne', "That said, we shouldn't have to worry about them<br/>here now that Marduk is in town.")
('Aaron', 'How many men have they got? We talking just one<br/>area or the whole city?')
('Renne', 'They have enough people on the ground to rival a<br/>large jaeger corps—and with vastly better equipment.')
('Renne', "Their chief of security in particular, he's a real force<br/>of nature.")
('Renne', 'Of course, I imagine you all know that pretty<br/>well already.')
('Feri', 'Kasim...')
('Aaron', 'Yup. Gramps here described him as one of the<br/>strongest jaegers to walk the earth.')
('Aaron', "It's funny. Guy's got this baby face—he doesn't even<br/>look thirty—but he gives off this vibe like he could<br/>kick your ass into next week.")
('Van', "At any rate, the city's in good hands with him<br/>patrollin' around.")
('Van', "We still gotta figure out what Almata's plotting<br/>next, though.")
('Renne', 'Speaking of, you confirmed those two you<br/>encountered yesterday were connected to the<br/>Gardens, correct?')
('Van', 'Yeah. Said they were overseers.')
('Van', "That checks out—they've got four units, and an<br/>overseer in charge of each one.")
('Agnès', 'The two of them seemed to be connected to Almata<br/>differently, though.')
('Agnès', 'Melchior is both an overseer and a high-ranking<br/>executive in Almata.')
('Agnès', 'But his cohort said that she was only a contractor.')
('Bracer Alvis', 'Talk about complicated... I wonder what the story<br/>there is?')
('Van', "We're not much the wiser than you guys<br/>there, unfortunately.")
('Van', "What we do know is that the most monstrous mafia<br/>and most vile assassins to ever live have joined<br/>hands—and that ain't good.")
('Renne', "Indeed. After we have Basel taken care of, we'll need<br/>to devise a strategy for dealing with them.")
('Renne', "Have you managed to learn anything more about<br/>what Almata's up to here?")
('Agnès', 'Unfortunately not...')
('Agnès', 'If anything, we were hoping you might have a lead on<br/>where Professor Callaghan might be.')
('Renne', "I wish I did, but I'm not too familiar with the<br/>geography of this area.")
('Renne', 'I tried to see if I could find anything on the net, but<br/>they covered their tracks, unfortunately.')
('Renne', 'Sorry for coming up empty handed.')
('Agnès', "Don't worry about it. It really wasn't going to be<br/>that easy.")
('Renne', "Aside from that, my only other advice is to keep the<br/>septium veins in mind. They're more relevant than<br/>you might think.")
('Feri', 'The septium veins...?')
('Agnès', 'I recall Risette mentioning those recently, actually.')
('Renne', 'They do have a tendency to affect the orbal network,<br/>in particular.')
('Renne', 'At first glance, they appear unrelated. We had no way<br/>to prove they were at all related...')
('Renne', '...until a certain phenomenon in Crossbell<br/>demonstrated that the two CAN affect each other<br/>under the right conditions.')
('Renne', "This incident here is eerily reminiscent of what<br/>happened a year and a half ago. It's just my<br/>hunch, though.")
('Quatre', 'Well, that does make a lot of sense.')
('Van', 'Yeah. Thanks for the pointer.')
('Van', "Well, we're gonna get back to trackin'<br/>down Callaghan. What are you three up to?")
('Bracer Regina', "We'll be doing the rounds to keep the city<br/>under control. We can't just leave it all to Marduk.")
('Bracer Alvis', "Yeah. They're good, don't get me wrong, but they're<br/>even shadier than you guys are. I don't trust 'em.")
('Renne', "I'll be helping out, too, until there's some other<br/>development that demands my attention.")
('Renne', 'I need to keep an eye on all the other students as well.')
('Renne', "We're all waiting here for you, Agnès—Odette and<br/>Albert, too. Don't forget that, okay?")
('Agnès', "I won't. Please be careful, Renne.")
('Agnès', "The aerotrams aren't moving!")
('Aaron', 'Well, great. To the bridge, then! Haul ass!')
('System', 'Where would you like to go?')
('Van', 'Authentication Rank error.')
('Van', 'Joy.')
('Risette', "It's locked.")
('Van', "Yeah. Guess we'll have to come back another time.")
('System', 'Head to the Institute of Science?')
('Quatre', 'Your card would let you ride to the institute yourself<br/>if you wanted to. That said...')
('Feri', 'I wanna try riding the aerotram!')
('Risette', 'I agree with Ms. Al-Fayed. It does sound like fun.')
('Van', 'Authentication Rank error.')
('Van', "Bah. We ain't allowed.")
('Agnès', "Our card rank just isn't high enough...")
('System', 'HP and EP were fully restored!')
('Van', "Huh. This one's real serious soundin'.")
('Agnès', "Yeah...and I understand why they don't want to go to<br/>the guild or the police about it.")
('Agnès', "I really hope we can help them while we're here.")
('Feri', "We might learn more about what's going on in the<br/>institute while we're working on it, too. That'd be two<br/>birds with one stone!")
('Aaron', "Makes sense. Sounds harmless to me, but what's<br/>your take?")
('Van', 'Feri brought up a good point. We can get some info<br/>on the institute while we work this case.')
('Van', "Pretty vague, though. They didn't give their name<br/>OR the professor they're accusin'.")
('Van', "Really goin' outta their way to make our job difficult.")
('Risette', 'Naming names in this case may result in the professor<br/>or other parties threatening the whistleblower.')
('Risette', 'I believe our client just prefers to err on the side<br/>of caution.')
('Aaron', 'Yeah, that tracks.')
('Van', 'Fair enough. Risette, can you handle recording<br/>our convos?')
('Risette', 'Certainly.')
('Van', "We gotta be careful who we talk to about<br/>this, though. Client doesn't want word of this<br/>gettin' out.")
('Van', "Let's start with people unrelated to the institute—that<br/>way, we don't accidentally hit a nerve.")
('Agnès', 'That makes sense to me. I imagine there will be<br/>plenty of those here in the Artisanal District.')
('Agnès', "Let's get started!")
('System', 'Quest School of Hard Knocks started!')
('Barnaby', 'A professor abusing their assistants? Hmm...')
('Barnaby', "Well, I'm not sure why you're asking me specifically<br/>about it, to be honest.")
('Barnaby', "I just work in Verne's procurement division. I don't<br/>attend the institute or work with them directly at all.")
('Van', "We know, and that's exactly the angle we want.<br/>Word travels, y'know?")
('Barnaby', "I get that... I haven't really heard anything about<br/>it, though. Sorry.")
('Barnaby', 'Verne and the institute are very closely linked,<br/>though, and that does create conflicts of<br/>interest sometimes.')
('Barnaby', "I may not have heard about it, but it IS believable.<br/>It's very possible the two sides are stressing each<br/>other out.")
('Feri', 'Could you tell us a bit more about how Verne and the<br/>institute work together?')
('Risette', 'The Verne Company awards grants to the Institute of<br/>Science to research and develop new products on<br/>their behalf.')
('Risette', "That allows the Verne Company to curate their<br/>products with research from the institute's experts.")
('Feri', "Oh, wow! That's really neat.")
('Agnès', "If I recall, Verne can trace its roots back to the old<br/>Artisans' Guild, and to the institute itself.")
('Agnès', 'I always figured they worked well together because<br/>of that.')
('Barnaby', 'They did... Past tense. They had good relations while<br/>their senior advisor was still there.')
('Barnaby', "Alas, she left Basel some time ago. Now Verne and<br/>the institute hardly collaborate at all—it's every<br/>project for itself.")
('Aaron', 'Maybe the asshat in charge scared her off?')
('Van', 'Thanks for the info. That helps a lot.')
('Boss Grover', "Hmm... Doesn't ring a bell, sorry. My son is studying<br/>at the institute, and he's never told me about anything<br/>like that.")
('Boss Grover', "That doesn't prove it one way or the other, of course,<br/>I just haven't heard about it.")
('Aaron', 'Did he tell you about any other stuff? Anything helps.')
('Boss Grover', 'Hmm... Well...sometimes I do hear about people in<br/>the same lab butting heads over funding.')
('Boss Grover', 'I heard these grumblings about two professors going<br/>at it, even. Seems like a pretty stressful place.')
('Boss Grover', "With all the greed and infighting over projects, it<br/>sounds like it's got everybody at each other's throats.")
('Feri', 'That makes sense, yeah... That might be what started<br/>the harassment.')
('Feri', 'Do you know which professors specifically?')
('Boss Grover', "I really can't remember, sorry. I feel like there was at<br/>least one of Professor Hamilton's students involved,<br/>but that's all I got.")
('Agnès', 'I see...')
('Agnès', 'I wonder if this professor was jealous of someone else,<br/>or someone envied them instead.')
('Van', 'Well, thanks for the info, all the same.')
('Millia', "That wasn't fair! You cheated! You didn't outdrive me<br/>at all!")
('Dick', "H-Hey, a win's a win! You're such a sore loser!")
('Dick', 'You ALWAYS win against me! I deserve to win, too!')
('Bracer Alvis', "E-Easy, easy. I'm sorry for butting in like that.")
('Bracer Alvis', 'Maybe next time we can give Millia a little boost to<br/>balance it out, okay?')
('Millia', "But that wouldn't be fair either! I just wanna beat him<br/>fair and square, okay?!")
('Dick', "Hey, don't take it out on him for helping! Why can't<br/>you just suck it up?!")
('Bracer Alvis', 'Ugh... This is just great...')
('Van', "Huh... Didn't expect to find one of Elaine's<br/>coworkers in an argument with some kids.")
('Agnès', 'He looks like he could use a hand, too...')
('Van', "Hey. Fancy runnin' into you here.")
('Van', "What happened to the hot shit bracer I bumped<br/>into earlier? Can't break up an argument between a<br/>couple kids?")
('Bracer Alvis', 'You?!')
('Bracer Alvis', "Goddess, of all the people... If you just wanna laugh<br/>at me, you can do that later. I'm on official business,<br/>so get lost!")
('Agnès', "No, not at all! I apologize if we're interrupting you.")
('Agnès', "It's just that you looked like you were in need of help.")
('Feri', 'So, what are you two arguing about? We heard a bit<br/>of the conversation, but could you fill us in?')
('Dick', 'We race each other with RC cars a lot.')
('Dick', "But Millia's way too good a racer, so she usually wins.<br/>She really whooped me today, so I was down in<br/>the dumps...")
('Dick', '...but then this really cool bracer came over and<br/>offered to help!')
('Aaron', "Well, aren't you a model bracer, huh? The kids<br/>love you.")
('Bracer Alvis', 'I headed back to the guild after I ran into you guys,<br/>but then I came across these two after I started<br/>my rounds.')
('Bracer Alvis', "The boy's car is a Leno Land Carrier, just like the one<br/>we use at the guild.")
('Bracer Alvis', "I, uh... I can't deny it got me a little curious.<br/>One thing led to another and I kinda lent him<br/>a hand.")
('Van', "Huh. Didn't know they made RC versions of those.<br/>I dig it—even the li'l tykes can wheel these around.")
('Van', 'Wait, wait, wait, hold on a second. Is that<br/>a Nightbreaker?!')
('Feri', 'Oh, now you mention it, yeah! It looks exactly like<br/>your car, just a different color.')
('Feri', 'They make radio-controlled versions of those, too?')
('Millia', "Yup, they do! I'm a big fan of this model.")
('Van', "Hey, you know what's up! When it comes to power,<br/>you can't beat an Ingert!")
('Millia', 'Oh, yeah! Totally agree with you!')
('Quatre', '(...Umm, what am I watching?)')
('Dick', 'So, yeah. Today was just different.')
('Dick', 'I followed the advice the bracer gave me, and I won!<br/>I actually won! I beat her for the first time in forever!')
('Dick', "But Millia's being a real sore loser about it. I beat her<br/>fair and square!")
('Millia', "You DIDN'T beat me fair and square! You had<br/>a coach! I've always beaten you all by myself!")
('Millia', "But now I'm supposed to accept I lost because you<br/>got an adult to help you? How is that fair?!")
('Dick', 'Oh, come on! It sucks losing all the time! Just lemme<br/>have this!')
('Millia', 'Uh-uh! Beat me by yourself first!')
('Millia', "If you're happy to CHEAT, then go race in the<br/>CHEATERS' club! You can win all you want there!")
('Dick', 'H-Hey! You wanna say that again?!')
('Bracer Alvis', "Look, I... I'm sorry. I realize in retrospect that I<br/>shouldn't have gotten involved.")
('Bracer Alvis', "So, erm... Yeah. This is how it's been for the last<br/>minute or so.")
('Agnès', "Ah... Yeah, that's a bit of a conundrum, isn't it?")
('Van', 'I got an idea, actually.')
('Van', "How do you feel about pairin' up with me,<br/>young lady?")
('Van', "Alvis takes the boy and then we've got a perfectly fair<br/>two on two rematch.")
('Dick', 'Oooh! That sounds like a great idea!')
('Millia', "Yeah! That works for me. With an adult on my side,<br/>too, it'll actually be fair!")
('Risette', 'Excellent idea, Mr. Arkride. This should help them<br/>race each other more fairly.')
('Bracer Alvis', "...Okay, yeah, that's actually a good idea. Guess a<br/>broken clock's right twice a day.")
('Bracer Alvis', "I see right through you, though. You don't just do<br/>things out of the kindness of your heart.")
('Bracer Alvis', "You've got an ulterior motive, don't you?")
('Van', "...Uhh, no. My intentions are as crystal clear as that<br/>pickup's paint job.")
('Van', "I just don't like seein' my favorite truck lose a<br/>rigged race. That's all there is to it, man: justice.")
('Quatre', 'You know, that toes a fine line between genuine<br/>swagger and just...idiocy.')
('Aaron', 'Yeah, he does that.')
('Bracer Alvis', 'Well, that works for me. I guess if I sorta squint, I can<br/>see your point.')
('Bracer Alvis', 'So, how do you two feel about it? Does that<br/>sound good?')
('Millia', "Sign me up! I wanna show him who's boss!")
('Millia', "It'll be me and him versus the two of you!")
('Dick', "Me, too! Last time wasn't just a fluke, watch!")
('Bracer Alvis', "All right! We've got ourselves a match!")
('Millia', "I won't lose this time!")
('Dick', 'Uh-huh? Prove it!')
('Bracer Alvis', "That's a relief. The kids are calmed down, now that<br/>we've figured out a resolution to all this.")
('Bracer Alvis', "But now I'm indebted to a spriggan, of all people...<br/>Urrgh! Don't let this go to your head, you hear?!")
('Van', "Pfft. This doesn't even register on my balance sheet.")
('Van', "Just don't hold back, you hear? I'm not goin' easy<br/>on you.")
('Van', "This is about more than just you and me, or those two<br/>kids—it's Leno vs. Ingert! And us Ingert fans, we<br/>don't take a loss lyin' down!")
('Bracer Alvis', "I... Yeesh. You're way more into this than I am...")
('Bracer Alvis', "But hey, you've got a point. This is a chance to settle<br/>our differences for good and all. So y'know what?<br/>Bring it!")
('Feri', "Wow, everyone's really pumped for this!")
('Agnès', "Heehee. Van can't help himself when it comes to<br/>cars, as we're all aware.")
('Agnès', '(It would be nice if this helped him get along better<br/>with Alvis, too...)')
('Risette', 'We should start by finding a suitable race course.')
('Risette', 'What did you use for your match earlier?')
('Bracer Alvis', 'It was right here, just a really straight and<br/>narrow sprint. I do think we should go somewhere<br/>else—we need a proper circuit for this.')
('Dick', 'Yeah! Something nice and open!')
('Millia', 'Hmm... I want that, too, but I dunno where.')
('Millia', "There aren't many open spaces where we won't be<br/>getting in anyone's way.")
('Quatre', 'I might have an idea, actually.')
('Quatre', "I know a venue that might be willing to host us.<br/>I'm not 100% sure, but it's worth asking.")
('Quatre', "Follow me, everyone. I'll see if I can get permission.")
('Dick', 'Yeah! Something nice and open!')
('Millia', 'Hmm... I want that, too, but I dunno where.')
('Millia', "There aren't many open spaces where we won't be<br/>getting in anyone's way.")
('Quatre', 'I might have an idea, actually.')
('Quatre', "I know a venue that might be willing to host us.<br/>I'm not 100% sure, but it's worth asking.")
('Quatre', "Follow me, everyone. I'll see if I can get permission.")
('Van', "Sure. I'm in.")
('Quatre', "Great. To New Town, then—that's where this<br/>venue is.")
('Van', 'That works for me, but can we come back to this a<br/>bit later? We got some other stuff to take care of first.')
('Quatre', 'All right.')
('System', 'Quest RC Car Showdown started!')
('Percy', 'Hmm. So this way leads down a mine, does it?')
('Percy', "That would make an excellent backdrop for a game,<br/>but...nah, it's probably too dangerous down there.")
('Van', 'Hey there. Arkride Solutions—you had a request<br/>for us?')
('Percy', "Well! I didn't expect you to help me out again.<br/>Thank you!")
('Van', "Figured we'd at least hear you out.")
('Van', "What's got you all the way out in Basel, anyhow?")
('Van', "'Specially all the way out here in the dark. You ain't<br/>up to somethin' shady, are you?")
('Percy', "Oh, haha. I'm just scouting locations for my<br/>new game. It has a mystery theme, so it only makes<br/>sense for it to be dark and secretive.")
('Percy', "Let's get down to business, then, if that's all right<br/>with you.")
('Percy', "Oho. You're the famous spriggan, are you?")
('Percy', "I'm really glad you're able to help me out this time!<br/>Sucks that it didn't work out earlier, but oh, well.")
('Van', "Sorry we couldn't help you out last time.")
('Van', "So what're you doin' out here in the dead of<br/>night, anyway? Bit shady, if you ask me.")
('Percy', "Oh, haha. I'm just scouting locations for my<br/>new game. It has a mystery theme, so it only makes<br/>sense for it to be dark and secretive.")
('Percy', "Let's get down to business, then, if that's all right<br/>with you.")
('Van', "Hmm? What're you up to there? Random-ass place<br/>to be hangin' around.")
('Percy', 'Oh, you came! Thank you so much for helping me<br/>out again.')
('Risette', 'How do you mean?')
('Van', "Oh, you're the puzzle game guy, aren't you?")
('Van', "What're you doin' out here in Basel this late at night?")
('Percy', 'Uh... My request? Are you not here for it, then?')
('Van', "You had a... Oh. Sorry, I never even noticed it.<br/>That's on me for not checkin' properly.")
('Percy', "Don't worry about it, haha.")
('Percy', "I'm working on a new mystery game right now, and I<br/>thought a nice, dark setting like this would be perfect<br/>for it.")
('Percy', "I'm recruiting testers right now, actually. I put a<br/>request out to you in the hopes you'd be able to help<br/>out again.")
('Percy', "I'd really appreciate it if you could lend me a hand.<br/>If you'd like, I can explain it to you and we can go<br/>from there?")
('Van', 'Works for me.')
('Percy', "Oh...? Wait, you wouldn't happen to be the spriggan,<br/>would you?")
('Risette', "You're aware of his work?")
('Percy', 'Of course I am—I remember hearing about it a lot<br/>over in the capital. I even tried to enlist his help at<br/>some point.')
('Percy', 'Never did get to meet him, though. I can only assume<br/>my request got buried.')
('Van', "Sorry about that. I'm the spriggan you're lookin' for, I<br/>just must've forgotten about it way back when.")
('Percy', "Oh, wow. This is perfect, then! I heard that you were<br/>in Basel, so decided to try my luck again, and it's a<br/>good thing I did!")
('Percy', "You see, I'm making a little AR game here, and I'm<br/>looking for people to help test it...")
('Percy', "How about I explain it to you, and then if you're<br/>interested, you can lend me a hand with it?")
('Van', 'Works for me.')
('Percy', "I worked with a really bright friend of mine on this<br/>concept, so if I can iron out the kinks, I'm sure it'll be<br/>a hit!")
('Percy', "You'll solve a series of puzzles, all while using these<br/>special gimmicks that fit Basel hand in glove.")
('Feri', 'Oh? What kind of gimmicks?')
('Aaron', 'Yeah? What kinda gimmicks are we talking?')
('Percy', 'Well, it would spoil the fun if I just told you.<br/>Here, have this leaflet.')
('Van', 'Lessee here...')
('System', "Urgent Message From HQ:<br/>Catch the rogue hacker on the loose in Basel!<br/>HQ will track the target's movements and relay them to you ASAP.")
('System', 'All transmissions will be sent in code to avoid<br/>leaking information. Decode the messages and<br/>apprehend the hacker!')
('Van', "Secret agents, huh...? All right, I'll bite.")
('Risette', 'And decoding our messages forms the puzzle aspect<br/>of the game.')
('Percy', 'Exactly! Sounds fun, right? I think we really knocked<br/>it outta the park with this one!')
('Percy', 'So, what do you think? Interested in giving it a shot?')
('Percy', 'What do you say? Feel like catching a hacker on<br/>the run?')
('Percy', "I'd really love it if you could take part in this test run.<br/>C'mon, you know you wanna!")
('Van', "We're interested, but we don't have the time<br/>right now. Got some other stuff to take care of, sorry.")
('Percy', 'Aww... I understand that, though.')
('Percy', 'If you get the time, you know where to find me!')
('Van', 'Sure, we got our other work taken care of. Why not?')
('Percy', "Awesome! I was hoping you'd be up for it.")
('Percy', 'Lemme put your names down under the tester group<br/>real quick...')
('Percy', "There's another tester working through the game<br/>right now, so see if you can solve the puzzle before<br/>they do!")
('Risette', "I see. I didn't realize we weren't the only testers at<br/>the moment.")
('Percy', "Yeah. I'm sending applications all over the place.<br/>My other tester started just a few minutes ago.")
('Percy', "I've got a special reward for whoever beats the game<br/>first, so good luck!")
('Feri', 'Well, now we gotta win!')
('Aaron', "Heh. The hunt is on now, isn't it?")
('Percy', "Well, good luck! I'll be watching from the sidelines to<br/>make sure everything's running smoothly.")
('Van', 'And there he goes...')
('Van', "So now what? We don't even have our first<br/>message yet.")
('Risette', 'This is true...')
('Van', "He did say that 'HQ' would send us messages, but,<br/>uhh...how?")
('System', "HQ to spriggan. We've found traces of the hacker in<br/>the Artisanal District. Investigate the sooted triad.")
('Van', "Whoa, I don't recognize this address at all. I think it<br/>really IS him.")
('Risette', "This first riddle should be easy to solve—I imagine<br/>it's like a warmup.")
('Van', "Makes sense. Let's get crackin', then.")
('Van', "Well, if there ever were a 'sooted triad,' this'd be it.")
('Van', "Not the easiest first riddle in the world, there're<br/>chimneys everywhere around here.")
('Risette', 'Indeed. It does make sense for a district<br/>this industrious.')
('Risette', "And it looks like we're not the first to make it this<br/>far, either.")
('James', 'Tch. I walked around this damn place for ages and it<br/>was right here this whole time?')
('Feri', "Maybe he's the other tester we heard about?")
('Aaron', 'Oh? Looks like it threw the other tester for a loop.')
('Van', "And here's the next set of instructions. It's almost like<br/>he's watchin' us.")
('Risette', 'Normally I would assume the same, but I imagine at<br/>least one of us would have noticed them if they were<br/>tracking us by hand.')
('Risette', "I think we're receiving these messages automatically<br/>based on our Xipha location data.")
('Feri', "I didn't know you could do that...")
('Feri', "Or is this something his helper worked on, maybe?<br/>That'd make sense.")
('Aaron', 'That might be giving him too much credit, no offense<br/>to him.')
('Aaron', 'No, I think this is the work of his helper. Must be a<br/>network expert.')
('Van', "Got a lot to think about once this is done...but that<br/>can wait. Let's look at this next message real quick.")
('System', "HQ to spriggan. The hacker's long gone from this<br/>area, unfortunately.")
('System', "We've picked up another trail elsewhere in the<br/>Artisanal District, though. Investigate the<br/>BATs' roost.")
('Van', "Yeah, go fig. Of course there's more to it than that.")
('Van', "And talk about cryptic. The hell's a BAT, all caps?")
('Risette', 'Ordinarily, I would assume the mammal...')
('Risette', "...but given how it's written, I imagine it's alluding to<br/>something else.")
('Risette', "And at any rate, we didn't encounter any bats in the<br/>mine, if memory serves.")
('Feri', "Hmm... I feel like I've seen these letters somewhere<br/>else in the city.")
('Feri', "*sigh* I just don't remember where.")
('Aaron', 'Hmm... Those letters do ring a bell. Where have I<br/>seen them before...?')
('Aaron', '...Bah. I got nothing.')
('Van', "The 'roost' part makes me think there's some place<br/>they all come back to—or that they're normally out<br/>and about.")
('Van', 'Keep your eyes peeled for anything that fits<br/>that description. This one sounds more specific.')
('Van', 'Well, this is the aerotram station...')
('Van', "...and I think we've struck gold here.")
('Risette', 'Ah, right! That does make sense.')
('Risette', 'BAT is an acronym for the Basel Aerotram.')
('Feri', "Ohh, now I get it! They all stop to 'roost' here!")
('Aaron', 'All right, yeah. Makes sense that this is the roost—<br/>they all stop here.')
('Van', "And boom, there's the next message.")
('System', 'HQ to spriggan. The hacker has made their way<br/>toward New Town. Board the tram and pursue them.')
('Risette', 'Straightforward enough, this one.')
('Van', "Yeah. Let's hop on.")
('Risette', 'This does offer an exceptional view, especially<br/>at night.')
('Risette', 'Oh? I see a familiar face took the tram just before<br/>we did.')
('Van', 'Lessee here...')
('Van', "Well, if it ain't the Aramis kid we bumped<br/>into earlier.")
('Feri', "He's been one step ahead of us the whole time.")
('Feri', "I feel like I'm too slow...")
('Aaron', "He's been a step ahead the whole way, from the looks<br/>of it.")
('Aaron', "Well, I'm not about to let some snot-nosed runt like<br/>him outwit me. Let's get moving.")
('Van', "Man, I remember when I was all held up about<br/>beatin' people to the punch like that. Youth, huh?")
('Feri', "Well, wait, you're still young, aren't you?")
('Aaron', "I'd think of a zing, but you make fun of yourself well<br/>enough as is.")
('Risette', 'Haha.')
('Chief Manager Eugen', "Well, if it isn't Quatre! What's got you looking<br/>so serious?")
('Quatre', "I had a quick question for you, if you don't mind.")
('Quatre', 'Have you had a woman from the institute come by<br/>looking for metal alloys?')
('Chief Manager Eugen', "Huh. It's like you saw it happen—we had someone<br/>like that come by just a bit ago.")
('Chief Manager Eugen', 'She had a valid card, so I went ahead and sold her the<br/>alloys she wanted.')
('Chief Manager Eugen', 'Should I not have...?')
('Van', "Nah, don't sweat it. We just needed to talk with her<br/>about somethin'.")
('Chief Manager Eugen', "I see. Well, I guess that's fair.")
('Chief Manager Eugen', 'Oh, now you mention it, actually...')
('Chief Manager Eugen', 'She said something about heading off to Liberl after<br/>she was done with her business here in Basel.')
('Chief Manager Eugen', 'If I had to guess, she probably made for<br/>Auge Canyon.')
('Chief Manager Eugen', "Thing is, she was driving some sporty ETWS make,<br/>so you probably couldn't catch her if you tried.")
('Quatre', 'Well, that gives us a good idea of where she is, at<br/>any rate. Thank you.')
('Feri', 'Should we head over to the canyon, then?')
('Aaron', "I mean, it's not like we can catch her if we do.<br/>You heard the man.")
('Van', "Nope. Northeast is where we're headin'.")
('Quatre', "...Why? That's the complete opposite direction.")
('Van', "Think about it. We're dealing with somebody who's<br/>makin' off with classified info and tryin' to shake the<br/>cops off her tail.")
('Van', "So why would she just tell some rando where<br/>she's goin'? She ain't gonna leave a trail like that.")
('Quatre', 'That does make sense... But then, why did she tell<br/>Eugen she was going to Liberl?')
('Risette', "To deceive him, I suspect. She may very well have<br/>known she's being followed.")
('Risette', "Having stolen top-secret intel, she's likely trying to<br/>throw the authorities off her trail.")
('Quatre', "That does make sense... It's exactly what a criminal<br/>would do.")
('Quatre', "I agree with Van, then. Let's head for the highway<br/>toward Edith.")
('Van', "Yeah. Once we're back in New Town, we can hop in<br/>my car and hunt 'em down.")
('System', "Van's car can be taken from the road<br/>under the motor pavilion.")
('Deliveryman Jason', "You wanna know if I've seen a suspicious<br/>freight truck? Bit of an odd thing to ask.")
('Quatre', 'Er, well, yes, it is. Sorry for just dumping that on—')
('Deliveryman Jason', "Nah, I'm just givin' you guff. I did actually see<br/>something like that last night.")
('Quatre', 'You did?!')
('Feri', 'So, what was suspicious about it?')
('Deliveryman Jason', 'Well, deliveries last night were all way behind<br/>schedule because of all the craziness in the city.')
('Deliveryman Jason', "We eventually got everything sorted out...even with<br/>that big ol' eye in the sky watching us all.")
('Deliveryman Jason', "So I finally wrap up my work, it's late at night, and<br/>I'm tired as hell. I start driving back toward my home<br/>on the edge of town.")
('Deliveryman Jason', "I'm waiting at one of the lights, and then I see this<br/>giant Red Star truck pull up next to me.")
('Deliveryman Jason', 'It had a really weird color scheme to it—never seen a<br/>Red Star painted like that. Had to be from outta<br/>town, I figured.')
('Deliveryman Jason', "But I figured, hey, he's a tired ol' dog like me, driving<br/>at ass o'clock. I'll give him a wave! I look out my<br/>window and... And, uh...")
('Deliveryman Jason', "...Nah, forget it. When I say it out loud, it<br/>sounds ridiculous. I must've just been seeing things.")
('Aaron', "Hey, c'mon, don't leave us hanging.")
('Agnès', "You might not have been seeing things after all.<br/>Won't you tell us, please?")
('Deliveryman Jason', "*sigh* All right, all right. Just don't laugh at me, okay?")
('Deliveryman Jason', 'I looked out the window, and...there was no one<br/>behind the wheel. Just, nothing.')
('Feri', '...Huh?')
('Quatre', 'What do you mean...?')
('Van', "Just nobody in the driver's seat at all?")
('Deliveryman Jason', "I'm as puzzled as you are. Before I could really process<br/>it, the light turned green and the truck rolled<br/>on away.")
('Deliveryman Jason', 'I had to put my eyes back on the road after that. I<br/>never saw that truck again—it only really dawned on<br/>me when I got home.')
('Deliveryman Jason', "Maybe the driver was just on the short side?<br/>Their truck was definitely taller than mine, too.<br/>Maybe I just couldn't see 'em.")
('Deliveryman Jason', "Either that or, again, I was tired as all get out.<br/>I might've just been seeing things.")
('Deliveryman Jason', "Haha. So yeah, that's how it seemed to me at the<br/>time, but honestly, it was probably nothing.")
('Deliveryman Jason', "Moral of the story here is that everybody needs<br/>their sleep. You can't go burnin' the midnight oil just<br/>because you can, y'know?")
('Agnès', "Lesson learned, yeah... We'll take care of ourselves.")
('Van', "Take it easy yourself, yeah? That sounds like the<br/>kinda thing a single good night's sleep won't fix.")
('Deliveryman Jason', "Oh, for sure. The city's sealed off until tonight, so I'm<br/>gonna try and take it slow while we've got nothing<br/>to do.")
