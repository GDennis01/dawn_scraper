('Feri', 'Whoa, get a load of this view... This is the perfect<br/>place for us to train!')
('Aaron', "That's all you ever think about, isn't it? Eh, not that<br/>I disagree. View's nice.")
('Van', "This area's better maintained, but don't<br/>get complacent.")
('Van', "One wrong step and you'll take a dive straight into<br/>the lake, so watch out.")
('Aaron', 'Come on. What do you take me for, huh? You sure<br/>know a lot about this place, though. What gives?')
('Aaron', "Oh, I get it. Must be because it's the perfect place for<br/>an old fart like you to go on walks.")
('Van', "I'm not that much older than you, damn it!<br/>You wanna know why? I used to come here with<br/>Elaine when we were students.")
('Aaron', "Reeeally now? With Beauty's Blade herself, huh?")
('Aaron', 'Granted, it does seem like a pretty obvious date spot.')
('Feri', 'A what kind of spot? Wait... Wait.')
('Feri', 'Are you saying Van and Elaine used to...?!')
('Van', '(Ugh. Can we not have this conversation?)')
('Van', 'Forget my love life and look over there!')
('Aaron', 'Man. Looks worse than I was expecting.')
('Feri', 'Is it, uh, always this bad?')
('Van', "Not normally, no. Usually they're on top of their pest<br/>control here because of all the visitors.")
('Van', "This smells like a case of our target calling 'em over<br/>here and infesting the place.")
('Feri', "Then we should smack 'em around!")
('Aaron', "Guess we can save the reminiscing about your<br/>schoolboy days for when we see Beauty's Blade again.")
('Van', "Argh, I never should've said anything! C'mon,<br/>you two! Let's get to work, already!")
('System', 'Found <br/>.')
('System', 'Found <br/>.')
('Aaron', "And that's how you do it.")
('Van', "You're at an intermediate level in your Gekka school<br/>skills, yeah?")
('Van', 'For someone whose main focus is being an ass, you<br/>can actually back up your smack talk when you<br/>want to.')
('Feri', "Not to mention, it's pretty neat how your fighting<br/>style has a dance rhythm to it!")
('Feri', 'Your skills are still a little shaky in places, but you did<br/>great this time!')
('Aaron', 'Get off your high horse, small fry. Put your arts to<br/>some actual use, and THEN we can talk.')
('Aaron', "And those shards, or whatever you call them?<br/>There's room for improvement there, for sure!")
('Feri', "That's—you... Grr!")
('Van', "Knock it off, you two. At least you can compensate<br/>for each other's weaknesses. Counts for a lot, believe<br/>it or not.")
('Van', "I'd say that, at this point, we're pretty well balanced<br/>during combat.")
('Feri', "True! Between the two of you up front and me at<br/>mid-range, we've got the offensive side<br/>pretty covered.")
('Feri', "Throw in Agnès' support arts, and we can handle just<br/>about any fight we get in!")
('Aaron', "Ehh, I guess it's true we're coming along as a team.")
('Aaron', "But that alone's not gonna be enough to take<br/>'them' down.")
('Van', '...No argument there.')
('Feri', "I won't let myself fall behind. Promise!")
('Feri', 'Thanks for always giving it to me straight, Aaron.<br/>I appreciate the honesty!')
('Aaron', "Don't sweat it. We all just wanna be a well-oiled<br/>machine at the end of the day.")
('Aaron', "What matters is we're done with this<br/>pain-in-the-ass job. Now let's make like a pom and—")
('Aaron', "What the? Who're they?")
('Feri', 'I see a handful of them. They look like civilians.')
('Van', "*sigh* Who knows? I know the rangers are supposed<br/>to be changing shifts, but that doesn't look<br/>like what's going on.")
('System', 'Quest Memorial Park Extermination completed!')
('System', 'Received')
(40301, "Yes, this location is perfect! It's exactly how I<br/>imagined it!")
(40301, 'All good to go over there, Nina?')
('Nina', 'Yes. Ready when you are.')
('Nina', "Though are you sure it's such a good idea to<br/>wander in like this?")
('Nina', 'It sounded like the ranger wanted us to wait until<br/>after he changed shifts.')
('Nina', "Isn't it strange that the park is closed on a<br/>holiday, too? What if something happ—")
(40301, "You worry too much. We scheduled an appointment<br/>ahead of time. It's all good.")
(40301, "Besides, you're so in demand right now. If I let this<br/>opportunity pass, they'd have my hide.")
(40301, "Now, the weather's looking a little suspect, so let's<br/>film what we came here for while we still can.")
('Nina', "...All right. If you're sure.")
(40302, 'All set, sir!')
(40301, 'Good! Positions, people!')
(40301, "All right, Nina. Let's start with scene 17-2 and—")
('Nina', 'Ah!')
(40302, 'Aaaaaah!')
(40303, 'Wh-Why are there monsters here?!')
(40301, 'Aaaugh! Get away from me! Get away!')
('Nina', 'Ungh!')
('Van', 'Get down!')
('Aaron', 'Hah! Buncha runts!')
('Feri', 'Hey, are you okay?!')
('Nina', 'Wh-Who are...?')
('Van', "We'll talk later. You guys stay back for now!")
(40301, 'Whoa!')
('Nina', "They're...amazing.")
('Aaron', "These losers might've brought a whole pack, but<br/>honestly, that frog we fought was worse.")
('Van', "Yeah, nothin' to it! We can take 'em all!")
(40302, 'Aaaaaah!')
('Feri', 'Oh, crap. Reinforcements?!')
('Aaron', "Frickin'...")
('Van', "(Damn. I don't know if I can make it!)")
('Fie', "I've got this.")
('Feri', "She's fast! Her moves are crazy!")
('Aaron', 'Who in the hell...?')
('Van', "Ha! Well, I won't say no to a little help! You two hold<br/>down the fort here!")
('Fie', "Thanks. Now let's clear these guys out.")
('Van', 'You read my mind, Sylphid!')
('Van', 'Phew. You all right?')
('Fie', 'Hardly broke a sweat. Looks like your friends are<br/>fine, too.')
('Aaron', "Nice. Guess that's a wrap.")
('Feri', 'Targets neutralized. Are you guys okay?')
('Nina', "Y-Yes. I wasn't sure we would make it...")
(40301, "That...was sensational! Thank you so much! You're<br/>all heroes!")
(40301, 'Just who are you people?!')
(40311, 'Hey! Everything okay over here?')
('Van', 'Well. Glad that little surprise is behind us.')
('Fie', 'You said it.')
('Van', "All right, last thing to do is a combat test and then<br/>we're done. Think you can give me the usual, Risette?")
('Risette', 'It would be my pleasure. Let us begin!')
('System', 'From there, the combat exercise proceeded without a<br/>hitch, bringing an end to the testing regimen.')
('System', 'After contacting Associate Professor Esmeray, it was<br/>time to regroup back at the office.')
('System', 'Several minutes later, Van and Rumsfeld arrived at<br/>the location designated for the ransom delivery.')
('System', 'With only moments to spare, the two came prepared,<br/>hauling an attaché case filled with mira.')
('Jeffrey', '...There you are.')
('Berzelia', 'Rumsfeld! You came!')
('Rumsfeld', "Oh, my lady, I'm so relieved you're all right!")
('Jeffrey', "Whoa, now. Let's not count our chickens before<br/>they've hatched.")
('Jeffrey', "We specifically asked for the girl's pops to come do<br/>the trade-off, but I sure don't see him anywhere.<br/>What's the deal?")
('Jeffrey', "Don't tell me he's the guy next to you. I find that a<br/>little hard to swallow.")
('Rumsfeld', 'No. The master is currently away on business in a<br/>remote region. We, as her bodyguards, have been<br/>dispatched in his stead.')
('Van', "Sorry I'm not the guy you're looking for.")
('Van', "But don't worry. We still made sure to bring what<br/>you're really after.")
('Van', 'We got ten million mira right here. Should be<br/>enough to satisfy, yeah?')
('Jeffrey', "Eh, it's good enough. You did the bare minimum you<br/>were expected to, at least.")
('Jeffrey', 'Sucks to be you, though, eh, girlie?')
('Jeffrey', "His own daughter gets nabbed, and your old man just<br/>throws some cash at the problem. Can't even be<br/>bothered to show his face.")
('Jeffrey', "Don't you think it's a little suspicious he's at work?<br/>Maybe he decided to ditch you and hang out with his<br/>girl-toy instead.")
('Berzelia', 'My father would never do any such thing.')
('Berzelia', "But...I suppose, perhaps, that he...doesn't love me<br/>after all, if even this failed to sway him.")
('Eddy', 'Berzelia...')
('Rumsfeld', 'My lady, you have nothing to fear.')
('Rumsfeld', "It's true the master is...ill-mannered at times.<br/>But there's nobody in all of Zemuria who loves you<br/>more than he.")
('Rumsfeld', "If you don't mind, I have a message I'd like for you<br/>to hear. Perhaps it will demonstrate how he<br/>truly feels.")
('Berzelia', "Is that...my mobile terminal? What's it doing here?")
('Rumsfeld', 'The master sent a recording to this device yesterday.')
('Rumsfeld', 'Please, have a listen.')
(40302, '*bzzt* Is this thing on? Am I being recorded?')
(40302, 'Ahem. First, I should explain that I have to take off<br/>this morning on the first train out.')
(40302, 'Since we cannot speak in person, I wanted to leave...a<br/>message for you, at the very least.')
('Berzelia', "That's...my father's voice! It's really him!")
(40302, 'I... I am so sorry, Berzelia.')
(40302, "I'm always so distracted with my work. I can only<br/>imagine how lonely you must feel.")
(40302, "Your birthday is coming up soon, isn't it.")
(40302, "I know I was away on other business trips for the past<br/>two birthdays, and wasn't able to celebrate as I<br/>should have.")
(40302, "But I promise you, I'll do whatever it takes to make<br/>sure I'm home in time for your birthday this year.")
(40302, "And when I do return, I'm going to give you your<br/>present myself.")
(40302, 'Until then, it pains me that I have to leave you alone,<br/>yet again.')
(40302, 'Please, try to keep your spirits up. Know that I really,<br/>truly do love you, Berzelia...my darling daughter.')
('Berzelia', "*sniffle* Father! I didn't realize you cared so much...!")
('Eddy', 'Heh, glad he decided to step up and show he knows<br/>how to be a dad for once.')
('Van', "How'd you manage to come across that voicemail?<br/>I'm genuinely impressed.")
('Rumsfeld', 'Well, I remembered that the master asked me several<br/>days ago how to send such a message to someone.')
('Rumsfeld', 'It made me wonder if, perhaps, it was the young lady<br/>to whom he sent it. Then, when I went searching, sure<br/>enough, there it was.')
('Berzelia', "*sniffle* How could I have been such a fool?<br/>I shouldn't have doubted Father and tested him<br/>like this.")
('Berzelia', "I'm sorry, Rumsfeld. I must confess. This whole<br/>kidnapping...was planned by me.")
('Berzelia', "I...was scared Father didn't truly love me, so I...")
('Rumsfeld', 'Think nothing of it, my lady. You felt the need to act.<br/>I completely understand how you must feel.')
('Berzelia', '*sniffle* Heehee...thanks, Rumsfeld.')
('Berzelia', "I'm okay, Eddy. You can let go of my hand now.")
('Berzelia', 'I might not have achieved what I set out to do, but I<br/>still want to pay everyone what I can in exchange for<br/>their time.')
('Eddy', "Berzelia, you don't have to do that. But if you're<br/>comfortable with it, I won't stop you.")
('Jeffrey', 'Nnnot. So. Quick, Eddy.')
('Jeffrey', "This dumbass sob story's over! Now the<br/>fun begins!")
('Berzelia', 'Wh-What is the meaning of this?! We had a deal!<br/>Are you breaking it?!')
('Jeffrey', 'You bet your fine, rich ass we are! Why take your<br/>pitiful paycheck when we could make off with that<br/>hefty ransom?!')
('Jeffrey', "And it's all thanks to our wonderful pal, Eddy.<br/>We couldn't have done it without him.")
('Jeffrey', "It's not every day you meet a gullible mark who's just<br/>begging to be held hostage and robbed of her<br/>own money!")
('Berzelia', "You can't be serious. You tricked me, Eddy? I<br/>trusted you!")
('Eddy', "No, that's not true! I only agreed to help out with<br/>your fake kidnapping, I swear! This is news to<br/>me, too!")
('Jeffrey', "And as for you two gents...don't even think about<br/>trying anything funny.")
('Jeffrey', 'Hand over the case, nice and quiet-like.')
('Jeffrey', "And make it quick, or else I can't guarantee daddy's<br/>little girl will celebrate her birthday in one piece.")
('Rumsfeld', 'You...! If you put even a single scratch on Ms.<br/>Berzelia, you will pay for it!')
('Van', "Man, I hate bein' right. I had a feeling it'd go down<br/>like this.")
('Jeffrey', "I didn't ask you to introduce yourself, but I know<br/>you're that famous spriggan everyone always<br/>talks about.")
('Jeffrey', "I was on the lookout for cops or bracers, but I sure<br/>didn't count on meeting someone like you.<br/>That geezer there's one conniving old fart.")
('Rumsfeld', 'So you know about Mr. Arkride as well, do you?')
('Rumsfeld', "I figured you to be some mere hoodlum, but it<br/>appears you're smarter than you look. A shame you<br/>waste it on such nonsense.")
('Van', 'Well, if you know who I am, then we can cut right to<br/>the chase.')
('Van', "I took on a job, and I fully intend to complete it.<br/>You're givin' that girl back, one way or another.")
('Van', 'If you want to make a deal, we can talk, but not until<br/>you hand her over first.')
('Van', "Otherwise I've got permission from my butler friend<br/>to send you all straight to Aidios. Don't think I won't<br/>do it.")
('Eddy', 'Hey, hold on a minute, Jeffrey!')
('Eddy', 'The Desire I know would never stoop to something<br/>this low!')
('Eddy', "Put the gun down before you do anything we'll<br/>all regret! Please!")
('Jeffrey', "We'd 'never' do something like this? Pff-ha!<br/>Don't make me laugh. You don't know the first thing<br/>about us.")
('Jeffrey', 'Listen, I got you in the gang for one reason and one<br/>reason only: because you made for a handy,<br/>expendable pawn.')
('Jeffrey', 'But you know what? You did good, putting this rich<br/>brat up to all this. Better than I ever expected, really.')
('Jeffrey', "I owe you one, so I'll tell you what: you can leave our<br/>gang, right now, if you're so queasy about getting your<br/>hands dirty. How 'bout it?")
('Eddy', "You can't... You can't be serious. Jeffrey, tell me<br/>you're lying!")
('Eddy', 'I looked up to you! I thought you were badass!')
(40351, "Quit yer snivellin', already!")
('Eddy', 'Augh!')
('Berzelia', 'EDDY!')
('Jeffrey', 'Anyway, getting back to business.')
('Jeffrey', 'Where were we? Oh, right, letting the girl go free.')
('Jeffrey', "I wouldn't push my luck if I were you. Last time I<br/>checked, you weren't in a position to be making<br/>demands of us.")
('Jeffrey', "Far as we're concerned, this chick's just a pile of used<br/>bait, now. You sure you want to push your luck?")
('Berzelia', 'Eeek!')
('Rumsfeld', '...Very well. We shall go ahead and hand over<br/>the briefcase.')
('Rumsfeld', 'All we ask is that you return the young lady to<br/>us unharmed.')
('Jeffrey', 'Yeah, yeah, you got my word.')
('Jeffrey', 'Now step forward niiice and slowly. Any sudden<br/>movements and I blow her brains out.')
('Jeffrey', 'Stop right there.')
('Jeffrey', "Leave the case on the ground and go straight back.<br/>I'll only let her go if you do.")
('Van', 'Got it. I hear you.')
('Van', "(Now comes the tricky part. There's no way he hands<br/>her over quietly.)")
('Van', '(We already agreed that Rumsfeld would go in and<br/>rescue her while I held these idiots back.)')
('Van', '(The question is what to do about the money.<br/>The safest thing would be to prioritize her safety and<br/>let the cash go.)')
('Van', "(But that'd be ten million mira down the drain.<br/>Hardly chump change.)")
('Van', '(On the flip side, Rumsfeld and I could trust Eddy<br/>with the case and focus on rescuing the girl. What to<br/>do...?)')
('Van', "(It's settled. Forget the money. Rescuing the girl<br/>comes first!)")
('Van', 'All right, look. We have every intention of giving you<br/>the money, just like you asked.')
('Van', "But we need to trust you'll fill your end of<br/>the bargain. What do you say you let her go forward a<br/>bit, first?")
('Jeffrey', "What did I just tell you?! You're in no position to try<br/>and boss me around. Now, are you gonna do as I say,<br/>or what?")
('Van', 'Fine. You made your point. Is this good enough<br/>for you?')
('System', 'Van did as he was told and tossed the attaché case.')
('Jeffrey', 'Hah! You moron! You really did it?!')
('Van', "You're damn right, I did. Now it's your turn.<br/>Hand her over, now!")
('Jeffrey', 'Hahahaha...')
('Jeffrey', 'Ahahahahaha!')
('Jeffrey', "You think after netting this much cash doing<br/>nothing, I'm just gonna let her go? I'd have to be<br/>stupider than you!")
('Jeffrey', "Amazing. A few measly little threats were enough to<br/>convince you to part ways with 10 million mira.<br/>You're one of a damn kind.")
('Jeffrey', "We'll be holding on to her for the time being.<br/>Better start scrounging up some more mira for the<br/>next ransom!")
('Berzelia', 'No!')
('Van', 'Heh, too damn predictable!')
('Jeffrey', "Get the mira, boys! It's ours now!")
(40351, 'Yes, sir!')
('Jeffrey', "Don't think I didn't see this coming, too!")
('Van', "Ggh... Right back at'cha!")
('Jeffrey', 'Wha...?!')
('Rumsfeld', 'My lady, over here!')
('Berzelia', 'O-Okay!')
('Jeffrey', 'Gah, what the hell are you idiots doing?!')
(40351, "D-Don't blame me, boss! That old dick's stronger<br/>than he looks!")
('Jeffrey', "Damn it. I wasn't planning on you guys putting up<br/>such a fight.")
('Jeffrey', "Here's a thought: how about I take the money and we<br/>call it even. Deal?")
('Van', 'Fine. Much as I hate seeing you get your grubby<br/>hands on it.')
('Jeffrey', 'Hahaha, haters gonna hate! Later, suckers!')
('Van', 'What an asshole. That leader of theirs was a crafty<br/>little prick to the end.')
('Van', 'Hmm?')
('Eddy', 'Ack... Ow...')
('Berzelia', "Eddy! You're all right!")
('Agnès', '*sigh* Well, that escalated quickly.')
('Agnès', "At least it seems like Berzelia made it out safe<br/>and sound. That's what counts.")
('Feri', 'The bad guys were able to make off with the ransom<br/>money, though...')
('Aaron', 'Yeah. Sucks the bastards made out with the ten<br/>million, though.')
('Rumsfeld', "Please, don't concern yourselves with that. It was a<br/>small sum to pay to ensure my lady's safety.")
('Risette', 'Indeed. Without that money, I doubt they would<br/>have backed down otherwise.')
('Van', "That's my take, too. We managed to resolve things<br/>amicably enough.")
('Eddy', '...')
('Eddy', "I'm...so sorry I put you through that nightmare.<br/>I can't tell you how glad I am that you're okay.")
('Berzelia', "It's all right, Eddy. I'm just relieved you aren't<br/>too hurt.")
('Berzelia', "If anyone should be apologizing, it's me. I feel terrible<br/>for believing that you deceived me...")
('Risette', "It's nice to see the two of you make amends.")
('Rumsfeld', 'I must emphasize, your business with us is not done.<br/>You put the young lady in danger in the first place.')
('Rumsfeld', 'I wish to hear your side of the story later, in order to<br/>get a full picture of what transpired. Is that all right?')
('Eddy', "Yes, absolutely. I don't know how I'll ever make up<br/>for the lost money, though...")
('Berzelia', "Please, don't take this out on Eddy! It's my fault any<br/>of this ever happened.")
('Van', 'Well, looks like you can handle things from here.')
('Van', "Unless you need anything else, I think we're going<br/>to bounce.")
('Rumsfeld', 'Mr. Arkride, everyone, thank you again for<br/>your assistance.')
('Rumsfeld', 'No words are enough to express my gratitude to you!')
('Van', "(It's settled. I'm gonna trust Eddy to keep the<br/>money safe!)")
('Van', "You're damn right, I did. Now it's your turn.<br/>Hand her over, now!")
('Jeffrey', 'Hahahaha...')
('Jeffrey', 'Ahahahahaha!')
('Jeffrey', "You think after netting this much cash doing<br/>nothing, I'm just gonna let her go? I'd have to be<br/>stupider than you!")
('Jeffrey', "Amazing. A few measly little threats were enough to<br/>convince you to part ways with 10 million mira.<br/>You're one of a damn kind.")
('Jeffrey', "We'll be holding on to her for the time being.<br/>Better start scrounging up some more mira for the<br/>next ransom!")
('Berzelia', 'No!')
('Van', 'Heh, too damn predictable!')
('Van', 'Hey, buddy! Wanna clear your name and do<br/>something good for once? Think fast!')
('System', 'Van flung the attaché case at Eddy, who caught it.')
('Eddy', 'Huh?!')
('Eddy', "Holy—! This thing's heavy!")
('Jeffrey', 'Think you can scam us outta our dough, do you?<br/>Give it here, Eddy!')
('Eddy', "...No. I'm not letting Desire get a single coin!")
('Jeffrey', 'Wrong choice, buddy. I gave you a chance. Now go<br/>say hi to Aidios, dipshit!')
('Eddy', 'AAAAAAUGH!')
('Berzelia', 'EDDYYY!')
('Jeffrey', 'Wha...?!')
('Rumsfeld', 'My lady, over here!')
('Berzelia', 'O-Okay!')
('Jeffrey', 'Gah, what the hell are you idiots doing?!')
(40351, "D-Don't blame me, boss! That old dick's stronger<br/>than he looks!")
('Jeffrey', "Damn. Never thought they'd put up this much of<br/>a fight.")
('Jeffrey', "But the numbers are on our side. It's five on two!<br/>Or should I say one?")
('Jeffrey', "Famous or not, you're still just a single spriggan<br/>flying solo. I'd love to see you take on all of us!")
('Van', 'You think I still work solo, huh? Well, I got bad news<br/>for you, pal. Arkride Solutions is expanding<br/>these days!')
('Agnès', 'Everyone! Are you okay?!')
('Feri', "Your fun's over now that we're here!")
('Aaron', 'Heh. Sure took your sweet time calling us in, chief.')
('Rumsfeld', "Now it's five on four, though I do believe it's fair to<br/>say that the balance of power has tipped in the<br/>other direction.")
('Rumsfeld', 'All of which is to say, thank you all for coming to<br/>our aid.')
(40351, "Haha, some reinforcements! You've got chicks<br/>with you!")
(40351, "Yeah, we've still got the edge! Come on, Jeffrey!<br/>Let's get 'em!")
('Jeffrey', '...')
('Jeffrey', "Damn it. No. We're pulling out.")
(40351, 'What?!')
('Jeffrey', "You heard me! I said we're<br/>pulling out!")
(40351, 'Eek!')
(40351, 'Y-You heard him, boys! Time to scram!')
('Jeffrey', "Don't think you've won, jackass. I'll make you regret<br/>crossing us.")
('Van', 'Heh, well, that was a surprising turn of events. I half<br/>expected them to press their luck and come<br/>in swinging.')
('Van', "Guess Desire's got some brains after all, especially in<br/>that fearless leader of theirs.")
('Van', "But...that's not the important thing right now.")
('Eddy', "Shit! I can't believe I actually got shot back there.<br/>Ow...")
('Berzelia', 'Eddy! Rumsfeld, he needs first aid, right away!<br/>Can you help him?')
('Rumsfeld', 'Certainly, my lady.')
('Agnès', 'Let me help, too!')
('Agnès', 'Phew... Good work, everyone.')
('Agnès', 'We got a lot done today, between rescuing Berzelia<br/>and patching up Eddy.')
('Van', "He's not completely out of the woods. I've got a<br/>hunch those goons are going to have it out for him<br/>after what he pulled.")
('Van', "So I took the liberty of tippin' the cops off about this<br/>whole mess so they can keep 'em on their radar.")
('Van', "But at least you'll live to see another day thanks to our<br/>little hostage's quick thinkin', kid.")
('Berzelia', 'Eddy did nothing wrong. He was tricked by all the<br/>rest of them. How could I not help? He even<br/>managed to save the money!')
('Berzelia', "Thank you so much for everything, Eddy. I'm...<br/>I'm so sorry I ever doubted you. What I said<br/>was terrible.")
('Eddy', "No, it's okay, I totally understand. I'm the one who<br/>ought to be apologizing here.")
('Eddy', "I'm...so sorry I put you through that nightmare.<br/>I can't tell you how glad I am that you're okay.")
('Risette', "It's nice to see the two of you make amends.")
('Rumsfeld', "We'll cover the cost of his care. It's the least we can<br/>do to repay him for what he's done.")
('Van', 'Looks like you can handle things from here, then.')
('Van', "Unless you need anything else, I think we're going<br/>to bounce.")
('Rumsfeld', 'Mr. Arkride, everyone, thank you again for<br/>your assistance.')
('Rumsfeld', 'I cannot begin to tell you just how grateful I am to<br/>have you on our side!')
('System', 'Quest A Daughter in Danger completed!')
('System', 'Earned')
('System', 'Received')
('System', "Welcome to this park's lookout spot. Enjoy the lush<br/>water and rich flora and fauna this location has<br/>to offer.")
('Feri', "All the more reason we can't let those monsters wreck<br/>this place. Right, Van?")
('Van', "You bet. We've gotta kick 'em out pronto so folks can<br/>visit this place again.")
('Aaron', 'Ehh, if we really have to, I guess.')
('System', "Known as the 'Little Brother.' Together with the Big<br/>Brother to the west, they comprise the park's<br/>Twin Falls.")
('System', "Known as the 'Big Brother.' Much taller than the<br/>Little Brother to the east, together they comprise the<br/>park's Twin Falls.")
('System', "Dirke Memorial Park's largest lake, spanning an area<br/>of roughly 90,000 square arge.")
