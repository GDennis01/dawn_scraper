('Selma', 'Why did this have to happen? I was really looking<br/>forward to enjoying the festival with Lodi...')
('Selma', "Just my luck. No matter how much I need it, I just<br/>can't catch a break.")
('Selma', "Maybe there's still hope for us two! We're together<br/>now, yeah? It has to mean something!")
('Selma', 'I suppose we can still enjoy the festival together!<br/>...As friends.')
('Selma', "I should probably be grateful we're even friends to<br/>begin with...")
('Selma', "Right... There's always next year!")
('Selma', '(N-No way... Was Lodi planning on inviting me this<br/>whole time?)')
('Selma', "(He's such a dreamboat. So chill—so relaxed.<br/>Doesn't throw a hissy fit at the drop of a hat!<br/>Oooh, my ex would be eating. His. Heart. OUT!)")
('Selma', "*huff* *huff* It's nice to be able to run again.<br/>Feels like things are finally back to normal.")
('Selma', "I couldn't go jogging at all during lockdown. I barely<br/>started and my legs already feel like jelly. How easy<br/>you can fall out of shape...")
('Selma', "I'm not letting that happen again! I'll just have to pick<br/>up the pace to make up for lost time!")
('Selma', 'Lodi was already such a good listener and overall just<br/>so much fun to hang out with.')
('Selma', "To think he'd be so dependable, too! Hah, take that,<br/>worthless ex of mine! He's so much better than you!")
('Selma', "This is that singer-songwriter everyone's on a<br/>buzz about? Whoa. His performance is<br/>so emotional...")
('Selma', "It's so wonderful, getting to hear music like this<br/>somewhere I take for granted on my everyday jogs.")
('Selma', "Goes to show what I've been missing out on this<br/>whole time, never slowing down to smell the roses.")
('Selma', "Lodi's finally opened up my eyes. There are so many<br/>things I'm seeing clearly for the first time...<br/>Wait—why are my cheeks wet?")
('Selma', '*huff* *huff* Just a bit more and then I can call it<br/>a day.')
('Selma', "I don't wanna risk missing the concert tonight!<br/>Lodi invited me to see this up-and-coming artist<br/>named Jess.")
('Selma', 'But first, a shower! Last thing I want to do is show up<br/>there all sweaty!')
('Selma', "Lodi's such a good listener. He's the best, most<br/>considerate drinking buddy I've ever had.")
('Selma', 'Guys should be taking notes from him! HE should be<br/>taking notes!')
('Selma', 'Ahh. Nothing beats the refreshing chill of an autumn<br/>breeze after a good jog.')
('Selma', "When winter comes, a nice jog will do enough to<br/>warm me right up. Every season's a new experience.<br/>I love running year round.")
('Selma', "Now that I think about it, I think I've heard about<br/>this public bathhouse over in Old Town.")
('Selma', 'It might not be a bad idea to relax and warm myself<br/>up after a nice jog. Not to mention wash off all<br/>this sweat.')
('Selma', "I've been seeing flyers all over the concert hall for this<br/>pop singer-songwriter.")
('Selma', "Lodi's a big fan, so I've been thinking about watching<br/>one of his performances sometime soon.")
('Selma', "It's fun to broaden your horizons. Plus! It gives me<br/>something to bond with Lodi over!")
('Selma', "Everyone's been talking about the Tharbad<br/>Film Festival.")
('Selma', "Hmph. Just the kind of thing my jerk of an ex would<br/>be into. Always called movies 'films,' the<br/>pretentious asshole! I'm almost glad he dumped me.")
('Selma', "Grr... Just thinking about him makes me SO angry!<br/>Ugh. I'm gonna go take a nice jog to clear my head.")
('Selma', "I don't care if it's the middle of the night. Once this<br/>rain lets up, I'm runnin' till my vision goes white!")
('Selma', "I started dieting and jogging after getting dumped,<br/>but I stuck with running 'cause it was fun.")
('Selma', "It's great visiting places I usually wouldn't go to, and I<br/>get to talk to cool people. Like Lodi!")
('Selma', 'Maybe getting dumped was the best thing to ever<br/>happen to me!')
('Selma', "Ugh, why is Shino's food so darn GOOD?! I want to<br/>hold off since I just lost a lot of weight, but I can't!")
('Selma', "I first came across Shino's food truck on Station<br/>Street, but I like it more when she's in Riverside.<br/>The scenery just adds to it all.")
('Selma', "I used to just drink at her place, venting all my<br/>troubles away. I can't believe it took me this long to<br/>find out her food bangs so hard.")
('Selma', "Speaking of bangers, I heard the taco stand's got<br/>some great offerings, too. I kinda wanna give them<br/>a try.")
('Selma', '...If I can get past just how much the guy running it<br/>gives me the heebie jeebies. Oh, but I want to try out<br/>everything else in Riverside!')
('Selma', '*huff* *wheeze* A-All right. Good time as any to take<br/>a breather.')
('Selma', "But I've definitely been getting the hang of this whole<br/>exercising thing. Maybe I can multitask and sightsee<br/>around Riverside while I'm out?")
('Selma', 'I overheard people in front of the Blue Score talking<br/>about some popular performer who plays there...')
('Selma', 'Riverside might just be a lot more fun than I gave it<br/>credit for!')
('Selma', "I never imagined I'd make a friend while I was<br/>stumbling my way through this whole diet and<br/>exercising thing. How lucky am I?!")
('Selma', "He's a cyclist. I'm sure he knows the area real well, so<br/>I'll try to ask him about good running paths. Ahh, it's<br/>almost like we were fated to meet!")
('Selma', "*huff* *wheeze* I can't even remember the last time<br/>I ran. Oh, geez. I'm cramping up already.")
('Selma', "No! Nope! I am NOT letting that jerk win! He's SO<br/>gonna regret dumping me just 'cause I didn't fit into<br/>those stupid pants he got me!")
('Selma', "I can't wait till he comes back, beggin' on his knees<br/>once I fit into a size four!")
('Selma', "*huff* *huff* Running's a lot harder than I thought<br/>it'd be, though... But I am NOT going to quit!")
('Selma', "Screw it! I'm too far to turn back now. Size four<br/>or BUST!")
('Selma', "Huh? Shino's food truck's not here today. Aww, I was<br/>really hoping to grab a drink and get my mind off<br/>of everything.")
('Selma', "*sigh* I just can't catch a break.")
('Selma', "And I don't even have anyone to vent to now!<br/>Ugh, whatever! It's less calories for me!")
('Selma', "I know! I'll go for a run instead! Maybe he'll notice<br/>me if I shave off this weight. Who needs dinner and<br/>drinks anyway?!")
('Lodi', "We've gone everywhere, but we somehow ended up<br/>back in Riverside. Haha, guess there's no better place<br/>than here.")
('Selma', "Uh-huh. You said it. It's been hard getting around<br/>with everyone here, but I'm glad we got to have the<br/>time to sightsee.")
('Selma', "My ex was SO lame. We'd never go to cool places<br/>like this.")
('Lodi', "Then we'll have to go to as many as we can, to make<br/>up for time lost. Wanna do this again after<br/>the festival?")
('Lodi', 'All the cool spots in town get even cooler with a<br/>friend around!')
('Selma', "O-Oh, okay—I mean. Yeah, totally! Friends, haha.<br/>I'd love that.")
('Lodi', "How about a toast? I know the festival isn't until<br/>tomorrow, but it feels appropriate.")
('Selma', "Cheers! I'm grateful for the turn my life has taken,<br/>broadening my horizons. It's been so much fun.")
('Selma', "But most of all...I'm grateful I met you, Lodi.")
('Lodi', "Ahaha, couldn't have said it better myself. Cheers to<br/>new friends!")
('Lodi', 'Speaking of which, do you have any plans for the<br/>Revolution Festival, Selma?')
('Selma', "Oh, umm—y-yeah! W-Wait, no! I d-don't have<br/>anything going on. Why do you ask?")
('Lodi', "That's a relief to hear. What do you say we go<br/>out together? I guarantee you it's gonna be a whole<br/>lot more fun than going alone.")
('Selma', "Wha—a-are you serious?! I-I mean—of course!<br/>I'd love to go with you!")
('Selma', 'You, me, festival, we go, have good time, kettle<br/>corn, yes! Mhm!')
('Lodi', "I'm glad you said yes! But, uhh... You okay? You look<br/>a little red there.")
('Lodi', "Oh. Sorry, gotta go. Be seeing you, Selma. I'll hit<br/>you up later so we can plan it all out.")
('Selma', "Y-Yeah, definitely! Just let me know, haha!<br/>Everything's peachy here!")
('Selma', "Did you hear about it? I just can't believe the whole<br/>village would be wiped out like that...")
('Selma', 'Not to mention the lockdown... What are we<br/>supposed to do at a time like this?! Like, what do<br/>you do?!')
('Lodi', "Take it easy, Selma! Let's just relax and take this all<br/>one step at a time.")
('Lodi', 'State of emergency or not, we need to be steady.<br/>Just try to keep living your day-to-day as always.')
('Lodi', "We just have to keep on going strong, and I<br/>guarantee everything will be just fine. So, take a<br/>deep breath. Let's try to calm down, okay?")
('Selma', 'Th-Thanks, Lodi...')
('Selma', "It's like nothing fazes you... How do you do it?")
('Lodi', 'Haha, I think you give me too much credit. If the<br/>Battle of Jormungandr taught me anything, I guess it<br/>was how to keep my cool.')
('Lodi', 'The thought of the war dragging on, of getting<br/>drafted if things got worse, the fighting in general...<br/>The anxiety got to me. I was a wreck.')
('Lodi', "It wasn't healthy, but it taught me that there's no use<br/>in worrying yourself up a storm over what you<br/>can't fix.")
('Selma', "Huh... You're steady, Lodi. If I could just...lean on<br/>you a bit more...")
('Selma', "Oh, and get this. He got all pissy at me 'cause I didn't<br/>fit into these stupid jeans he bought me!")
('Selma', "Can you BELIEVE that?! That was such a<br/>jerk move! At this point, I'm just glad we didn't last.<br/>I wouldn't wanna be stuck with someone so shallow.")
('Lodi', "Oh, geez. That's just awful.")
('Lodi', "Dude sounds like he has some real issues he needs to<br/>work through. There's nothing you could've done.")
('Selma', "Right?! You get it! And you're a guy, too! You hear<br/>that, Johnny?! It's all your fault, you jerk!")
('Lodi', "There we go. Let it all out, Selma. I don't mind.<br/>You're really inspiring, you know?!")
('Selma', 'I-Inspiring?! ME?! Y-You have the wrong idea!')
('Lodi', "I don't think I do. Even though it sucked, you took it<br/>in stride and turned everything around for the better.<br/>You're fit, and so much happier.")
('Lodi', 'Not everyone can go ahead and make the most out of<br/>a bad situation. It really just goes to show how strong<br/>you really are.')
('Selma', "A-Aww, no! I'm not that cool. You're making<br/>me blush!")
('Lodi', "It looks like your cardio's been going greater than<br/>ever, Selma. Keep it up!")
('Lodi', "Just don't forget to stay hydrated. Here—take this.")
('Selma', "Thanks, Lodi. Honestly, I've been enjoying my runs<br/>more and more as of late.")
('Selma', "The change of scenery, the feel of the breeze after a<br/>good run... I'll probably keep on running, even after I<br/>hit my target weight!")
('Lodi', "Haha, good! Nice to see you're sticking with it.<br/>How about I show you a new route, then?")
('Lodi', 'I ride my bike all over town and pass through places I<br/>think would make for decent running from time<br/>to time.')
('Selma', "I'd love to hear about that! I wanna get out and see as<br/>many new places as I can!")
('Selma', "Let me in on the juicy running info, and I'll be sure to<br/>keep an eye out for fun cycling paths for you<br/>in return!")
('Selma', '*huff* *huff* I hit my thirty selge goal way faster than<br/>I did last time.')
('Selma', "Thirty selge's a lot more than I went for yesterday.<br/>It feels nice, but I'm gonna be so sore tomorrow...")
('Lodi', "Sounds to me like you've done a great job of pushing<br/>yourself lately. But make sure you're keeping well<br/>hydrated! Here.")
('Selma', "Oh, umm, thank you? No, I'm sorry! I barely just<br/>met you! You don't have to be so nice to me!")
('Lodi', "Don't worry! I got extra water bottles, just in case.<br/>And it sounds like you earned it, anyway.")
('Lodi', "I'm Lodi, by the way. I bike around here a lot, so it's<br/>nice to meet someone else who enjoys feeling the<br/>wind on their face.")
('Selma', "Ahaha, no, it's nothing like that. I took on running so<br/>I could lose some weight. It's pretty good, though!")
('Selma', "The breeze feels really nice tonight in<br/>particular, actually. I'm sweating after that run, but I<br/>don't feel hot at all!")
('Lodi', "It's just the kinda thing you don't notice until you<br/>take on running. I'd probably run more if the bike<br/>wasn't so convenient for me.")
('Lodi', "If you learn to enjoy the little things when it comes to<br/>running, you'll be well on your way to enjoying the<br/>little things in life, too.")
('Selma', 'Yeah. I like the sound of that.')
('Lodi', 'I was really hoping to go around the festival<br/>with Selma. It was supposed to be a good way of<br/>seeing a totally new side of Edith.')
('Lodi', "But talk about new sides. I think we might've<br/>overshot things a little! Man, what a mess.")
('Lodi', 'I hope everyone else in the other districts is okay.<br/>And my bike, too...')
('Lodi', "I'm glad we were able to escape together. As her<br/>friend, I have to support her however I can.")
('Lodi', 'Hope this is the start of a long friendship between me<br/>and Selma. Her enthusiasm when going to new<br/>places is contagious. I love showing her around.')
('Lodi', "It's nice thinking she enjoys hanging out with me as<br/>much as I do with her.")
('Lodi', "She got really excited when I invited her to the<br/>Revolution Festival... I guess she's really looking<br/>forward to it.")
('Lodi', "All my friends said they'd be working during<br/>the festival.")
('Lodi', "I'm so glad Selma and I are friends. After all, the<br/>Revolution Festival's all about spending time with<br/>your buddies!")
('Lodi', "I'm hoping we can join up with some of my friends<br/>later on. What's a festival without friends? I'm sure<br/>Selma would agree with me!")
('Lodi', "Now that things are back to normal, it's off to work I<br/>go with ol' faithful here.")
('Lodi', "If I don't start now, I'm never gonna make up for lost<br/>time during lockdown.")
('Lodi', "Selma's in higher spirits now, which is good.<br/>Maybe I'll ask her to hang out later.")
('Lodi', "I'm honestly still a little on edge because<br/>of everything.")
('Lodi', "But there's people that got it way harder than I do.<br/>I need to be able to pull myself together for them.")
('Lodi', "Rather than fearmongering, we should help those<br/>that need us most. That's the first step.")
('Lodi', "I'm so happy Selma likes Jess' music.")
('Lodi', "There's something about his songs that just cuts<br/>straight to the heart and sticks with you.")
('Lodi', "I thought that might appeal to Selma, given what<br/>she's been through lately, so I recommended she give<br/>him a listen.")
('Lodi', 'That Selma girl I met recently has been enjoying<br/>running a lot.')
('Lodi', "She looks like the kinda gal that won't stop once she<br/>gets the ball rolling.")
('Lodi', "That's why I invited her to Jess' concert. I just hope it<br/>can be something else she'll enjoy just as much.")
('Lodi', "I love talking with Selma. We can go on and on,<br/>and before I notice, it's been hours. That's a sign of a<br/>great friendship in the making!")
('Lodi', "Today's my day off and I don't have any errands<br/>to run. Might be nice to ride my bike again for<br/>a change.")
('Lodi', 'Talking to Selma about running paths and slowing<br/>down to take in the scenery has helped rekindle my<br/>love of cycling.')
('Lodi', 'Sometimes I just need to go out on my bike and let<br/>Aidios take the wheel.')
('Lodi', "This rain came out of nowhere. I'm glad I was<br/>prepared for it, but still.")
('Lodi', 'Leaving your bike out in the rain all night is a good<br/>way to rust up its chain.')
('Lodi', "Of course, it's not an orbal bike, but mine takes just<br/>as much love and care and maintenance.")
('Lodi', "Selma didn't really give me the best first impression<br/>when we met. She just looked like a downer.<br/>Who knew she'd turn out to be so fun and chill?")
('Lodi', "Wonder what else I could talk to her about?<br/>She's fairly easygoing. Hmm. Maybe her favorite food<br/>spots, or what music she likes?")
('Lodi', "I don't know why, but Jess' music always gets me<br/>choked up.")
('Lodi', "All the emotions come through clear as day in<br/>his voice. Maybe there's a secret to it...")
('Lodi', 'Hmm. I wonder if Selma would enjoy his music.<br/>I think she might at least connect with the themes<br/>behind it.')
('Lodi', "I'm just about done with everything today. Once I<br/>wrap up here, I'll be heading to see Jess' performance.")
('Lodi', "I got floor tickets, so I gotta hurry and find a<br/>good spot. After that, it's a drink and some vibin' for<br/>the rest of the night!")
('Lodi', "I know Selma mentioned she was running to lose<br/>weight, but she looks like she's starting to genuinely<br/>enjoy it.")
('Lodi', 'Honestly, I could stand to go cycling more<br/>often again. Maybe we could even share routes!<br/>It would give us something else to talk about.')
('Lodi', "I've seen that girl jogging around here quite often the<br/>past week or so.")
('Lodi', "I don't think I'd ever seen her before that, though.<br/>Hmm. I guess people just discover good jogging paths<br/>every day.")
('Lodi', "But she looks like she's struggling a lot. I wonder<br/>what's really driving her.")
('Lodi', "All right! Work's done for the day now.<br/>Honestly, my commute has been a lot better since<br/>I started biking to and from.")
('Lodi', 'Speaking of, I heard the Grand Circuit had a huge<br/>turnout yesterday.')
('Lodi', "Heard the crowd was so dense you couldn't get<br/>anywhere on that side of town.")
('Lodi', 'I hope there are cycling races just as exciting as<br/>that someday!')
('Lodi', "Cycling is so convenient once you get used to the<br/>physical strain of it. Shopping's a breeze, and you<br/>don't have to spend on transportation.")
('Lodi', "I can't believe it's already been a year since I started<br/>biking regularly. Where has the time gone?")
('Lodi', "My bike's made errands and commuting a breeze.")
('Lashkar', 'Ugh... No, I-I...')
('Lashkar', 'Damn it! Damn it all!')
('Lashkar', '...')
('Van', '(We should probably leave him alone.)')
('Lashkar', 'So this is the capital, huh? I can see why Hans and<br/>Kaina come by every month.')
('Lashkar', "I'm glad Annie and I finally got to visit!")
('Lashkar', "All right. Let's get settled, and then we can head to<br/>the Bracer Guild together.")
('Lashkar', 'We can take a tour of the branch office and maybe<br/>ask how we can join.')
('Lashkar', "I heard there's a lot of cool shops close to the<br/>guild, too! We should go and check those out<br/>afterwards, yeah?")
('Annie', "Y-You wanna go shopping with me, Lashkar?<br/>Th-Thanks! I'd love to go to the department store.")
('Annie', "But are you sure we should be wandering around<br/>like this? The capital's very big... I don't wanna get<br/>lost on our first time here.")
('Lashkar', "Y-Yeah! It's fine! We've never gotten lost playing<br/>hide and seek in the woods near the village! I'm sure<br/>we'll be fine!")
('Lashkar', "So don't worry! You won't get lost—not with<br/>me here!")
('Annie', "This is my first time in Edith, so I'm glad Lashkar<br/>came with me.")
('Annie', "I know we're gonna have tons of fun! I never get<br/>bored with him around, and I know I can trust him.")
('Gordon', "Primo and I were able to take shelter along the<br/>road here. I need to make sure she doesn't run out<br/>into the thick of danger...")
('Gordon', "How can she be so calm through all of this?<br/>It's uncanny...")
('Gordon', "But I guess it's helped me cool off a bit.")
('Gordon', "Are you sure y'all are fine walking around in all this?")
('Gordon', "Just be careful, hear? I don't want y'all getting hurt,<br/>or worse.")
('Gordon', "Welcome, welcome! What d'ya say you give our<br/>Revolution Festival special a try?")
('Gordon', "It packs a punch flavor-wise! You can eat it here<br/>or take it to go, but either way, I'd recommend you<br/>get the drink and salad combo!")
('Gordon', "Primo's makin' a ruckus, but don't pay her any mind.")
('Gordon', "If she likes my tacos so much, I wish she'd just say so<br/>and leave it at that.")
('Gordon', 'Oh, right. Those idol girls are putting on a<br/>performance today.')
('Gordon', "Lulua asked me to come and watch 'em, so I'll mosey<br/>on down and see how it goes.")
('Gordon', "I think I can trust Primo to run the cart on her own<br/>while I'm gone.")
('Gordon', "I'm glad I could go show my support after Lulua<br/>asked me to come out to her performance.")
('Gordon', "I ain't an idol guy, but I can tell she's working her<br/>hardest every day.")
('Gordon', 'Almost brings a tear to my eye. Heh. I hope her<br/>career is a prosperous one!')
('Gordon', "Dang, does she ever slow down? I barely just hired<br/>her, and she's already plannin' new menu items!")
('Gordon', "But we're headed in the right direction, I'd say!<br/>We'll see what customers think of the new<br/>menu tomorrow.")
('Gordon', "Gotta hand it to her, though—Primo's enthusiasm is<br/>downright infectious. Girl's a firecracker.")
('Gordon', "I wasn't planning on addin' anything to the menu this<br/>year, but having a limited special for the festival's a<br/>great idea.")
('Gordon', "There's a whole lotta demand for our regular menu<br/>items as is, so stackin' on new prep time on top of<br/>that's gonna be a real hassle.")
('Gordon', "But I ain't worried. Not with Primo around.<br/>We should be able to handle it between the two of us.")
('Gordon', 'Good grief... How am I supposed to run a business<br/>without any customers?')
('Gordon', 'I went ahead and told Primo to take some time off.')
('Gordon', "There's plenty I could say about the lass, but she's<br/>smart enough to listen to people's advice.")
('Gordon', "I sure hope there won't be any terrorist attacks in<br/>the city...")
('Gordon', "In case there are, it's my responsibility to make sure<br/>Primo's safe.")
('Gordon', 'I recall seeing Lulua, the old lady, and a man<br/>talking to each other.')
('Gordon', "They seemed real cut up about somethin' or other—<br/>started raisin' their voices. They ended up crossing<br/>the river after.")
('Gordon', 'Dunno what happened after that, sorry. I wonder<br/>what that all was about...')
('Gordon', "Hey there. Good to see ya. Me an' all the food stall<br/>owners are out for drinks today.")
('Gordon', "There's a lot we've gotta talk about, with the<br/>Revolution Festival right 'round the corner.")
('Gordon', "Primo'll take your order while I'm here!")
('Gordon', "I'm sure Primo can handle the stall on her own for a<br/>little while.")
('Gordon', "What I'm not so sure about is whether she'll get<br/>experimental and start offerin' customers some new,<br/>weirdo tacos.")
('Gordon', "But hey! The lass has passion in droves! Hah! She's an<br/>inspiration, that one.")
('Gordon', "Primo's new recipes are a total hit! Man, I've never<br/>seen our sales go higher!")
('Gordon', "I wasn't so sure about all of her new ideas, but<br/>oh, boy! I'm sure glad I gave her a chance!")
('Gordon', "And all the better, 'cause those sales are payin' off her<br/>paycheck, haha! ...We're actually barely breakin' even.")
('Gordon', 'Welcome! Grab yourself a taco or two before we close<br/>for the night!')
('Gordon', "The sun's sure settin' quick these days. The days get<br/>shorter, but my part-timer's rants get longer!")
('Gordon', "I do worry about her gettin' back after dark, though.<br/>Maybe I'll walk her partway home after we finish<br/>cleanin' up.")
('Gordon', "Speakin' of which, there's a regular of mine who's an<br/>idol—comes over for her taco fix every day.")
('Gordon', "Didn't see her 'round today, though. Wonder if<br/>somethin' happened?")
('Gordon', "This odd duck has been comin' around and naggin'<br/>my ear off about my menu nonstop.")
('Gordon', "At least she's got an eye for detail, that one.<br/>Figured that'd help the stand a li'l, so I up and<br/>hired 'er.")
('Gordon', "Let me tell you, I've never seen a bigger food<br/>connoisseur that would not know which way up a<br/>pan goes.")
('Gordon', "She's lackin' the cooking skills, but not the taste buds,<br/>at least! Maybe she's got an idea or two to help<br/>improve my marinades.")
('Gordon', "We'll see if she's all bark and no bite after all!")
('Gordon', "Sheesh, that's a mighty hard downpour to just come<br/>outta nowhere. I'm gonna have to close shop<br/>early again.")
('Gordon', "The crummy weather does nothin' but hurt<br/>my business. I wish it'd knock it off!")
('Gordon', "Here's hoping the rest of the holidays are all sunshine!")
('Gordon', "More importantly, I wonder what's up with that girl?")
('Gordon', "She's been a little weird with me since I asked if her<br/>taste buds were messed up the other day.")
('Gordon', "Hope she's not gettin' herself too worked up about it.")
('Gordon', "I mean, she likes my tacos! Her sense of taste can't be<br/>that out of whack!")
('Gordon', "I didn't mean to offend her or anything. I just don't<br/>really want to change any of my recipes anytime soon.")
('Gordon', "Hey, good to see you! Wish ya'd gotten here a bit<br/>sooner, though. I'm about to close up shop.")
('Gordon', "Proper restaurants have their dinner rush or are just<br/>plain popular at night, but food stalls usually only see<br/>traffic durin' the day.")
('Gordon', 'If you wanna put in an order here, better be quick<br/>next time! Just like this lass here!')
('Gordon', 'You find what you need over at Horizon Heim?')
('Gordon', 'The landlord and I were discussing some recent<br/>goings-on a while back. We were drinking with one<br/>of my regulars.')
('Gordon', "Come to think of it, 's been a while since I last<br/>saw Giacomo. Wonder why he's not come by...")
('Gordon', 'Horizon Heim is that apartment building just across<br/>the bridge!')
('Gordon', 'You got business over there?')
('Gordon', 'Let me know if you do! I know the landlord, so I<br/>could introduce ya.')
('Gordon', "Good grief, that girl that's been comin' 'round of<br/>late's starting to get real annoyin'...")
('Gordon', "If it's not one thing, it's another! But it's always the<br/>same thing. Naggin', naggin', naggin'!")
('Gordon', "Wish I knew what she's all hot and bothered over.<br/>Maybe if that got solved, she'd settle for orderin' like<br/>a normal person.")
('Gordon', "Sunset already? Dang, where did the day go?<br/>Days just keep gettin' shorter and shorter.")
('Gordon', "The one silver linin' is people get hungrier<br/>'round autumn. Temperatures go down, but profits<br/>go up!")
('Gordon', 'Might be time I come up with an autumn<br/>special menu!')
('Gordon', "Riverside's a real nice sightseeing hotspot. It ain't just<br/>tourists that come 'round here, either. Locals love it<br/>here, too.")
('Gordon', "I barely gotta move a rege, but it already feels like I'm<br/>travelin', meeting so many different people every day!<br/>I never tire of it.")
('Gordon', "Have a walk around and see for yourself. I'm sure<br/>you'll meet all kinds of fascinating folk!")
('Gordon', 'Did something bad happen nearby? The police just<br/>stopped by to ask some questions.')
('Gordon', "It's the middle of the day, for cryin' out loud...<br/>You lot be careful, hear?")
('Gordon', "How about adding some spice to your life, friends?<br/>Once you have a taste, you'll come runnin' back<br/>for another!")
('Gordon', "Perfect for a snack on the go! Won't be a hassle to eat<br/>while you walk to your next date spot, eh?")
('Agnès', "Haha, umm... W-We're not on a date. But tacos are<br/>pretty typical fast food, right?")
('Van', 'Junk food, more than anything, but the tacos here are<br/>pretty damn good.')
('Van', "Really savory and rich. They hit just the right spot<br/>when you're hankerin' for some good food.")
('Primo', 'The secret to your success is carbs! Need more carbs<br/>in your recipes!')
('Primo', '*drool* Oooh, how about yakisoba tacos? Oh, wait!<br/>I know—how about we replace the meat<br/>with chocolate!')
('Gordon', "The hell? Lass, are ya sure your taste buds ain't just<br/>messed up?")
('Primo', 'What?')
('Gordon', 'Those kinds of goofy flavor fusions you always<br/>suggest are just cheap, gimmicky junk food.')
('Gordon', "Not that my tacos are any kind of white tablecloth<br/>fine dinin' or anything, and I don't think junk food's<br/>all that bad, but it's just plain weird.")
('Primo', "('Gimmicky junk food'? My sense of taste is not that<br/>bad...right?)")
('Primo', 'Darn it! These assholes are mucking up my sales!')
('Primo', 'The sooner I get rid of them, the sooner we can open<br/>the stand up again!')
('Primo', "You guys! Help me out! I'm gonna make them mince<br/>meat and serve them on a taco!")
('Primo', "Wh-Where's Shino?")
('Primo', "Is she just too scared to face me today? Or will she<br/>not even bother just 'cause she's already considered<br/>the top stall in Riverside?!")
('Primo', "I can't believe you'd bail out on the day of the<br/>Revolution Festival! Right when the competition is<br/>the fairest and fiercest! Come defend your title!")
('Primo', 'Argh! Darn it, Shino! Get over here and face me fair<br/>and square!')
('Primo', 'Where did you take that bar of yours this time?!<br/>Curse you, Shino!')
('Primo', 'Get your boozy butt out here and face me!')
('Primo', "We've tried everything, but nothing beats some good<br/>ol' fried food!")
('Primo', 'Carbs are the way to go! Nothing better for the soul<br/>than some good fried chicken and a beer to wash it<br/>all down!')
('Gordon', 'Hmm... Still gotta nail the flavor on it. Maybe needs<br/>some more vinegar?')
('Primo', "No, no! You're thinking too small! How about...we<br/>add some sides to it?! Like a salad combo?!")
('Gordon', "Hey, that idea ain't half bad. You might be on to<br/>somethin' here!")
('Primo', "No one's gonna believe our comeback! We'll turn the<br/>tables on Shino and be the best ones in Riverside!")
('Primo', "But we won't win if we don't come up with a tasty<br/>new menu!")
('Primo', "It's time to debut a brand new menu! Shino will rue<br/>the day she decided to set up shop anywhere near us!")
('Primo', 'State of emergency or not, people need to eat if they<br/>wanna stay alive!')
('Primo', 'There should be hundreds of potential hungry<br/>customers in Riverside!')
('Primo', "Argh, I'm not throwing in the towel just yet! Even if<br/>we lose some customers, we can still offer them a<br/>great menu!")
('Van', "Huh. Guess the old man's not lookin' after the<br/>stall tonight?")
('Van', "Damn. I'd come over to get my taco fix, but the old<br/>man must be off havin' a drink.")
('Primo', "That he is! But don't you fret, for I am here!<br/>Allow me to take your taste buds on a heavenly<br/>voyage of culinary delight!")
('Primo', "May I recommend trying our new Chocolate<br/>Rice Taco? It's a smash hit among our customers, and<br/>I guarantee it'll be a smash hit in your mouth!")
('Elaine', "Umm, thanks for the recommendation. I'll be sure to<br/>give it a try later.")
('Elaine', "(The stall owner's over there. Let's go talk to him.)")
('Primo', "Why is Shino's Bar so popular?!")
('Primo', 'Damn her chic sense of style and pinpoint attention<br/>to detail!')
('Primo', 'W-We might be able to compete if we extend our<br/>business hours to 9PM!')
('Primo', 'That should increase sales by at least ten percent!<br/>No, maybe even higher once the new menu rolls out!')
('Primo', 'The new menu I came up with is selling like crazy!<br/>Just as I planned!')
('Primo', "Soon the top spot among Riverside's food stalls will<br/>be ours!")
('Primo', "...No. Not yet! If we aim for the top, there's one<br/>hurdle we must still overcome! That mobile bar<br/>people talk about is my next target!")
('Primo', "I think I've seen it before. It's that food truck that<br/>shows up here sometimes, yeah? I'll go have a looksee<br/>next time they're here!")
('Gordon', "You plan on stayin' here all night? I'm gonna close up<br/>shop soon!")
('Primo', "B-But there's still so much we haven't talked about!<br/>You can't just leave me hanging here!")
('Gordon', "I got no idea what yer on about. You're a strange,<br/>strange girl.")
('Primo', "Th-There's still so much I can do! I can't just go<br/>home now!")
('Primo', 'Hah-HA! As of today, yours truly will be enacting her<br/>role as a newly-appointed flavor advisor and sales rep!')
('Primo', 'Prepare, world! I will be unleashing a new wave of<br/>flavor onto you!')
('Primo', 'My first offering to the world will be this little gem I<br/>came up with: the Chocolate Rice Taco!')
('Primo', 'Mhm! The perfect blend! This combination is<br/>simply sublime.')
('Primo', "Wait, I can't! The mere existence of this goes against<br/>everything I strive for! It's an affront to my<br/>very being!")
('Primo', 'I might have to talk this over with the other<br/>food carts... Hmm...')
('Primo', 'J-Junk food... Just hearing that is as if an arrow<br/>pierced my heart.')
('Primo', "No... NO! I can't—I WON'T give in! I can never<br/>give up! I have to trust my instincts—and my<br/>taste buds!")
('Primo', "That stubborn old man! Only I know the true<br/>potential behind his taco stand, but he won't listen<br/>to me!")
('Primo', "You're so close to perfection! Just push it a<br/>little harder! A change in seasonings and marinades<br/>could mean the world!")
('Primo', 'Why will he not listen to me?! You have the culinary<br/>world at your fingertips! You just have to seize<br/>the opportunity!')
('Primo', 'This food stand should offer mini tacos, too! I bet<br/>those would be a hit.')
('Primo', "Who thinks about tacos when you're looking for food<br/>on the go? No one! Everyone wants ice cream<br/>and crêpes!")
('Primo', "You can't just ask everyone to enjoy them the same<br/>way if you don't think outside the box! They need<br/>more options!")
('Primo', "But he just won't LISTEN TO ME!")
('Primo', 'Heh heh. I finally accomplished my goal of trying out<br/>every stall facing the river!')
('Primo', "I went from tacos, to noodles, to ice cream. It's a little<br/>weird, yeah.")
('Primo', 'But it was delicious! I would do it again!<br/>Though...maybe after my stomach settles first...')
('Primo', "I couldn't help but come back for those<br/>delectable tacos... What flavor! What zest!")
('Primo', "That's why I can't abide these half-baked, overly lax<br/>culinary methods!")
('Primo', 'Does he truly think his customers will be satiated<br/>with such a one-note approach to tacos? Hah!<br/>Puerile ideas wrapped in a crispy shell!')
('Primo', "Wh-What's with the food here?! It doesn't LOOK<br/>the best, but it's dirt cheap and doesn't skimp<br/>where it counts—FLAVOR!")
('Primo', "It's not high end by any means, yet it's so good I can't<br/>stop stuffing my face... How dare food this<br/>delicious exist!")
('Primo', "I'm finally at Riverside. I heard all the good eateries<br/>are down by the water.")
('Primo', "The atmosphere is living up to my expectations, but<br/>we've yet to see if the food will!")
('Primo', 'Only one way to find out! Look out, stomach—here<br/>it comes!')
('Rooney', "I-I'm really scared, b-but I have to keep it together!<br/>For Irle!")
('Rooney', "It's gonna be fine! Father Mansur and Mother Kyra<br/>are here! I'm sure the grace of Arusha will protect<br/>us all!")
('Rooney', "A-And Irle's mom should come for us soon...")
('Rooney', 'Irle never changes.')
('Rooney', "Since her mom's so busy, I need to take care of her!")
('Rooney', "I'm gonna go to the church to pray.")
('Rooney', "I'm really worried about Lashkar. He hasn't been doing<br/>well lately.")
('Rooney', "(It's like I can feel how sad Irle is just by how she's<br/>holding my hand. I...don't think I ever want to let go<br/>of her.)")
('Rooney', "(I'm also really scared, and I know I can't do<br/>anything, but...I want to at least be here for her.)")
('Rooney', 'I want to help tutor Irle and Lolo.')
('Rooney', "So I'm brushing up on the Central East's culture and<br/>language first so I can do that.")
('Rooney', "I asked Mother Kyra for help, and she said she'd be<br/>happy to! She's so nice.")
('Rooney', "(I hope Irle's mom doesn't get mad at her again...)")
('Rooney', '(Wait, why am I worrying about that?)')
('Rooney', 'Irle is so brave. Nothing scares her at all.')
('Rooney', "Feri, too! She's the bravest girl I've ever met! Are all<br/>the girls from the Central East like that?")
('Rooney', "I don't think Lolo's ever gone fishing, since his<br/>hometown is out in the desert.")
('Rooney', "I'm not a pro or anything, but I can teach him a thing<br/>or two!")
('Rooney', "You're only two years older than me, Feri, but you're<br/>so cool already!")
('Rooney', 'Tell me about your hometown next time, okay?')
('Feri', 'You got it! See you at Sunday School!')
('Rooney', "I'm the oldest, so I'm taking care of Irle and Lolo.")
('Rooney', "I come by to the church a lot 'cause it's close to<br/>my house.")
('Rooney', "I've been coming for so long, it almost feels more like<br/>home than my actual home does.")
('Rooney', "I still don't know a lot about Central Eastern customs<br/>though, so Irle is teaching me.")
('Rooney', "You're Lolo? It's so cool that you're from<br/>another country!")
('Rooney', "Irle's family is also from the Central East, even if she<br/>was born in Calvard!")
('Rooney', "She doesn't know a lot about places in the Central<br/>East, so I'd love to hear more from you!")
('Irle', "Hmph! Your name shouldn't be Rooney,<br/>it should be Weenie! 'Cause you are one!")
('Rooney', "C-C'mon! That's not fair!")
('Irle', "Waaahh! I hate these monsters! Make 'em go<br/>away, Rooney!")
('Rooney', "I'm right here, Irle! Don't worry about a thing!<br/>I'll keep you safe!")
('Irle', '*sniffle* R-Really? Will you stay with me?')
('Rooney', "I promise you I will! We'll be fine if we stick together!")
('Rooney', "I'm sorry that your mom's gonna be busy during<br/>the festival...")
('Irle', "It's okay—I don't mind! That just means you and me<br/>get to go to the festival together!")
('Irle', 'We can try all the yummy food and go watch<br/>a movie! Then... Then we can go to the tower and see<br/>what the city looks like at night!')
('Rooney', "Oh, wow. You've got the whole day planned<br/>out, yeah? From dusk till dawn.")
('Rooney', "We might get yelled at if we stay out for too long, so<br/>let's not go back home too late. Don't wanna<br/>worry anyone.")
('Irle', 'Okay! But we GOTTA see Edith at night from<br/>the tower!')
('Rooney', "I'm glad the mafia's gone and everything, but Lashkar's<br/>still not doing too good.")
('Rooney', "I make sure and pray every day for those who've lost<br/>their lives, so their souls can rest in peace.")
('Irle', 'I wanna pray every day, too! But I always forget...')
('Irle', 'So pray twice as hard for me, Rooney!')
('Rooney', "You know prayers aren't effective unless you do them<br/>yourself, right?")
('Irle', "Don't worry, Rooney! You're like a grownup, so I'm<br/>sure Arusha will listen if it's you asking!")
('Rooney', "Haha. Here's hoping.")
('Irle', 'They said a lot of people died on the news.')
('Irle', "Everyone from the Central East that lived there...<br/>Even Lashkar's family...")
('Irle', 'Why, Rooney?! Why did they all die?!')
('Rooney', "Irle. I... I don't...")
('Rooney', "(I don't know... And I can't do anything other than<br/>listen to her and let her grieve.)")
('Priest Kyra', 'Yes, Rooney. There is a language unique to the<br/>Central East.')
('Priest Kyra', "But I didn't expect you to want to learn it just to help<br/>tutor Irle and Lolo.")
('Priest Kyra', "Your kindness knows no bounds, does it, Rooney?<br/>You're so dependable.")
('Rooney', "You really think so? Irle says I'm just wishy-washy.")
('Priest Kyra', "Irle's not one to mince words, is she?")
('Priest Kyra', "But anyway. I'd be more than happy to teach you!<br/>Feel free to come by for a lesson whenever you're free.")
('Rooney', 'Thank you so much, Mother Kyra!')
('Rooney', "We've got Sunday School today! Did you both finish<br/>your homework?")
('Lolo', 'Yup! I got the worksheet right here with me!')
('Irle', "Nope! I didn't even bring my worksheet!")
('Rooney', "That's...not something you should be proud of, Irle.")
('Lolo', 'Umm... You wanna copy mine?')
('Irle', 'Yeah!')
('Rooney', "(*sigh* I hope Irle's mom doesn't get mad at<br/>her again...)")
('Rooney', 'Man, going fishing the other day was so much fun!<br/>Lolo had a total blast!')
('Irle', 'Yeah, and he beat you real bad at it! You must be<br/>pretty awful!')
('Rooney', "Hey, I'm not AWFUL. I'm just, y'know, not great<br/>with slimy, wriggly things...")
('Irle', "(You're such a wuss, Rooney! C'mon, you're the<br/>oldest one of us!)")
('Rooney', 'All right guys, what game should we play toda—')
('Irle', "We're playin' hide-and-seek! I'm it!")
('Rooney', "C'mon Irle. Shouldn't you let Lolo pick every now<br/>and then?")
('Irle', 'Wait, but why?! *sigh* ...Fine. What do you want to<br/>play, Lolo?')
('Lolo', 'Me? Well, umm...')
('Lolo', "I wanna try catching fish! Er, fishing! I think that's<br/>what it's called.")
('Rooney', "Oh, yeah. I guess you wouldn't know, since you're<br/>from the desert and all.")
('Irle', "Then let's go! I've gone fishing before!<br/>Come on, I'll lend you my fishing pole!")
('Irle', 'Hey, Feri!')
('Rooney', 'Hi, Feri! You said you were starting a new job, right?')
('Feri', 'Yup! These are my coworkers from<br/>Arkride Solutions!')
('Feri', "We're out on patrol right now!")
('Irle', "Wow! You're just like a grown up!")
('Rooney', "I can't believe you're only two years older than I am!<br/>You're already so cool.")
('Agnès', "(It's nice to see you've already made friends in<br/>Edith, Feri.)")
('Van', '(Looks like they took a shine to you already.)')
('Priest Kyra', 'Everyone, I have a surprise for you all before we<br/>start class. Starting today, Lolo here will be<br/>joining us!')
('Priest Kyra', "Everyone give him a big welcome! Why don't you tell<br/>us something about yourself, Lolo?")
('Lolo', "Umm, me and my family moved here from Elsaim<br/>because of my daddy's job.")
('Lolo', "I don't know anyone in Calvard yet, so I hope we can<br/>be friends.")
('Irle', "Welcome to Edith, Lolo! I'm Irle! I'm also from the<br/>Central East, so let's hang out!")
('Irle', "We're totally gonna be good friends!")
('Rooney', "My name's Rooney. It's nice to meet you, Lolo!")
('Rooney', "It's really late now. Let's go home, Irle!")
('Irle', "Huh? Why? I wanna keep playing! Can't we hang out<br/>a little more? Please?")
('Rooney', "We can't. Remember, your mom told us to get<br/>home early.")
('Irle', 'Why do you care about what she says?! Do you care<br/>about Ommah more than me?!')
('Rooney', "('Ommah'? Does that mean 'Mom'?)<br/>That's not true...")
('Irle', "Don't leave me, Rooney... You gotta protect<br/>me forever!")
('Rooney', "O-Okay, okay, I will! Just...stop squeezing, please.<br/>Can't...breathe.")
('Irle', "I'm hungry. Let's get chocolate crêpes!")
('Irle', 'I also wanna go say hi to Father Mansur and<br/>Mother Kyra!')
('Irle', "Mhm! I'm busy today!")
('Irle', "Rooney's always trying to act all grown up, but he's a<br/>big softie! He's a bit of a coward, but he's always nice.")
('Irle', "I'm sure Arusha will hear his prayers!")
('Irle', "*sniffle* Why did Lashkar's family have to die?")
('Irle', "His mom, and dad, and sister... It's just too awful!")
('Irle', "You're fun, Lolo!")
('Irle', "You can come to me whenever you need to! I dunno<br/>if we're gonna get along, but we gotta try, heehee!")
('Irle', "(Rooney always tries to act older, but he's just a<br/>big baby!)")
('Irle', "(He's always running out of breath when running and<br/>can't climb a tree! I thought boys were supposed to be<br/>good at that!)")
('Irle', 'I got a fishing pole!')
('Irle', "I'm letting Lolo borrow it. I don't mind at all!")
('Irle', "Wow, Feri! You're just like a grown up! You're<br/>the coolest!")
('Irle', "I'm gonna catch up to you soon! I'll be just as grown<br/>up in no time!")
('Feri', 'Heehee, I look forward to it!')
('Irle', "I'm older than Lolo, so it's my job to take care of him<br/>and teach him stuff!")
('Irle', "Say, aren't you forgetting something great about me?")
('Irle', "I mean, I'm just as polite as you are, Rooney! I'm a<br/>good girl!")
('Irle', 'I think I should be the oldest! I could take the bestest<br/>care of you and Lolo!')
('Irle', "Hmph! Your name shouldn't be Rooney,<br/>it should be Weenie! 'Cause you are one!")
('Rooney', "C-C'mon! That's not fair!")
('Irle', "Your mom's gonna be here soon to pick you<br/>up, right? What do you think of the school?<br/>You know you can trust me!")
('Lolo', 'I like it here!')
('Lolo', "Mother Kyra's really nice, Rooney's helping me<br/>study, and—")
('Irle', 'And me? How about me?!')
('Lolo', 'You, Irle...')
('Lolo', "You're a real ball of energy! Haha!")
('Irle', "(That's it? That's...disappointing...)")
('Lolo', "Dad couldn't make it today...")
('Lolo', 'But he said he can come celebrate festival day with us<br/>at the temple!')
('Lolo', "It's been a long time since we left Elsaim. I'm really<br/>excited to spend the festival with everyone!")
('Lolo', 'Why is everyone so scared? Is something going on?')
('Lolo', "What's a 'steak of immersion sea'? Is it tasty?")
('Lolo', 'Mom is really scared, too. Is there anything I can do?')
('Lolo', "I did my homework, but Irle didn't. I'm letting her<br/>copy mine.")
('Lolo', "I wonder if it's okay for her to do that. Does she<br/>ever study?")
('Lolo', 'I saw someone fishing at the river the other day.<br/>It looked like fun!')
('Lolo', 'I wanna try that out, too!')
('Lolo', "Mother Kyra is so kind. Rooney's helping me<br/>study, too!")
('Lolo', 'And Irle is real nice! I like it here already.')
('Lolo', 'I wonder what Sunday School in Calvard is like...')
('Lolo', "I hope it's fun!")
('Bermotti', "We ourselves haven't been able to connect to the<br/>orbal net, but some folks have gotten their stuff up<br/>and running.")
('Bermotti', "I'll try to get in touch with them to set up a way of<br/>communicating with you.")
('Bermotti', "If anyone can get us through this, it's you all.")
('Van', "You bet. We'll figure somethin' out.")
('Aaron', 'Keep an eye on Syd and the others, yeah?')
('Bermotti', "Don't you worry about Syd's injuries. I patched him<br/>up, so he'll be right as rain soon enough.")
('Bermotti', "Besides, the chief of security left a guard here.<br/>Shop's as safe a haven as you can get.")
('Van', "Marduk's nothin' if not thorough, I guess.")
('Shizuna', "Aww. It won't kill you to give them a compliment,<br/>you know.")
('Shizuna', 'Though even they are pretty in the dark about this.')
('Fie', "That's just how they roll.")
('Fie', "But even they don't look like they know what's<br/>going on.")
('Cao', 'So it goes for the mighty Marduk.')
('Cao', 'Though for as mighty as they are, they seem none the<br/>wiser about this situation as well.')
('Bermotti', "They've got some of their men patrolling the area.")
('Bermotti', "I'm sure we can at least depend on them for now.")
('Bermotti', "I'll try and get in touch with everyone. I leave the rest<br/>in all of your capable hands!")
('Bermotti', '(Those are some fine specimens right there! I would<br/>take all three for myself if they let me!)')
('Bermotti', "(Help me, Van! I'm fit to burst just looking at them—<br/>let alone trying to talk to them!)")
('Van', '(Yeaaah. What you got in mind might be above their<br/>pay grade.)')
('Bermotti', 'You should tuck in early today, Van. Get some nice<br/>rest and relaxation in.')
('Bermotti', "Better keep yourself in tip-top shape! There's a lot for<br/>us to look forward to.")
('Van', 'Heh. You said it.<br/>(...Lot to look forward to. Right.)')
('Bermotti', 'Working hard as usual, I see.')
('Bermotti', 'The incident with A is still making waves. All of my<br/>sources are still abuzz talking about it.')
('Van', "Got any juicy info you wouldn't mind sharin'?")
('Bermotti', "Of course I do! There's still some of A's gangsters out<br/>and about.")
('Bermotti', "It's quite concerning, knowing we have some<br/>stragglers laying low in the capital.")
('Feri', 'Yeah... It worries me, too.')
('Aaron', 'Not Melchior, not worth the time.')
('Agnès', 'We should still keep an eye out, just in case we come<br/>across any information regarding their whereabouts.')
('Van', "As long as it doesn't get in the way of everything else<br/>we're doing, it sounds good to me.")
('Bermotti', 'The streets are quite shaken after the aftermath of<br/>that A incident.')
('Bermotti', "It's going to be a while until things settle down, so<br/>take care of yourself.")
('Bermotti', "If any new info comes in, you'll be the first to know.")
('Bermotti', "I'll hit the pavement and see what I can find out, too.<br/>I owe Dingo that much.")
('Bermotti', 'Do try to keep an eye on Marielle, too, if you can.')
('Bermotti', 'I worry about what she might be up to, after<br/>everything that happened.')
('Bermotti', "Dingo sure's been putting in some overtime as of late.")
('Bermotti', "And here I am, just having to suffer, seeing him<br/>spend so much time with a beautiful lady that's<br/>not me!")
('Van', "I don't think your usual game's gonna catch his<br/>attention anytime soon.")
('Bermotti', "Boo. You're no fun.")
('Bermotti', 'But I digress. It looks like you got all your work down<br/>pat for the day, eh?')
('Bermotti', "I'm sure your assistance was more than appreciated!<br/>Arkride Solutions to the rescue!")
('Van', "Chill. I didn't do anything other than show up.")
('Van', "Guy's a clown, but he's at least got the balls to<br/>take responsibility. Guess we'll see how far that<br/>gets him.")
('Bermotti', "I don't quite know that I trust him or his claims of<br/>integrity just yet. I'll believe it when I see it.")
('Bermotti', "Oh, but I'll still keep an eye on the dear myself, so<br/>don't worry about doing all the heavy lifting.")
('Bermotti', "I'm sure the media frenzy will calm down after<br/>a while.")
('Bermotti', "It'll be up to him to decide how to handle things<br/>from here.")
('Bermotti', "Oh, but I'll still keep an eye on the dear myself, so<br/>don't worry about doing all the heavy lifting.")
('Bermotti', "Well, if it isn't Van and his crew! Welcome, dears!<br/>Welcome.")
('Bermotti', "I'm entertaining some unusual guests at the moment,<br/>though I think you three might already be<br/>acquainted, no?")
('Van', "Acquainted? Yeah. But they sure ain't gonna be<br/>gettin' a birthday card from me.")
('Van', 'Gonna guess they stopped by for some info.')
('Bermotti', "Good try, darling, but you know I can't tell you that.")
('Bermotti', "Mmm. But I might be willing to relent this time, if<br/>you ask nicely. I might even be willing to tell you that<br/>they're here asking about A.")
('Bermotti', 'You see, they have their sights set on a certain<br/>organization that A happens to be employing.')
('Van', 'Oh, yeah?')
('Van', "(All of the Gardens' overseers got artifacts with 'em.)")
('Van', '(It was a matter of time till the Septian Church sent<br/>someone over to try and recover those.)')
('Bermotti', "Oho! You finally brought over that fresh new hire I've<br/>been hearing so much about!")
('Bermotti', "Quatre Salision, right? You're one of Professor<br/>Hamilton's students, aren't you, sweetie?")
('Quatre', "That's right. And you must be Bermotti. I've heard<br/>my fair share about you as well.")
('Quatre', "Namely about how you're a reputable<br/>information broker.")
('Quatre', "It's a pleasure. I'll be providing technical support from<br/>here on, so I'm at your service if ever the need arises.")
('Bermotti', 'Oh, what a peach! Trust me, the pleasure is all mine.')
('Bermotti', "You've got a full litter of pups to watch over now,<br/>don't you, Van, dear? No more slacking off for you!")
('Van', "Don't you have a cocktail to make or something?")
('Agnès', "Haha. Don't worry. We all do our best to pull our<br/>own weight.")
('Feri', 'Hear, hear!')
('Aaron', "As long as no one loses their head, I'm fine with<br/>slacking off a little.")
('Risette', 'I look forward to a mutually supportive relationship<br/>between us, Mr. Bermotti.')
('Bermotti', 'Oh, by the by, Dingo mentioned that he wanted to<br/>make a reservation tonight.')
('Bermotti', "He's celebrating something with that little miss he's<br/>been looking after. That's so sweet of him.")
('Bermotti', "There's a special stipulation regarding this<br/>last request.")
('Bermotti', "The client says they'll reach out while you're on<br/>Expressway Route 3.")
('Bermotti', 'Do me a favor and go see what they have to say.')
('Bermotti', "Oho! You finally brought over that fresh new hire I've<br/>been hearing so much about!")
('Bermotti', "Quatre Salision, right? You're one of Professor<br/>Hamilton's students, aren't you, sweetie?")
('Quatre', "That's right. And you must be Bermotti. I've heard<br/>my fair share about you as well.")
('Quatre', "Namely about how you're a reputable<br/>information broker.")
('Quatre', "It's a pleasure. I'll be providing technical support from<br/>here on, so I'm at your service if ever the need arises.")
('Bermotti', 'Oh, what a peach! Trust me, the pleasure is all mine.')
('Bermotti', "You've got a full litter of pups to watch over now,<br/>don't you, Van, dear? No more slacking off for you!")
('Van', "Don't you have a cocktail to make or somethin'?")
('Agnès', "Haha. Don't worry. We all do our best to pull our<br/>own weight.")
('Feri', 'Hear, hear!')
('Aaron', "As long as no one loses their head, I'm fine with<br/>slacking off a little.")
('Risette', 'I look forward to a mutually supportive relationship<br/>between us, Mr. Bermotti.')
('Bermotti', 'Van, darling. A little birdie let me know you were in<br/>the 13th District today.')
('Van', "That's a fast little birdie, then. But yeah.<br/>The Immovable decided I'd play as his errand<br/>boy today.")
('Van', "Edith's gonna be pure chaos with people like that<br/>running around.")
('Bermotti', "Trust me, I know. I'm expecting all my sources to go<br/>wild with them in the mix.")
('Bermotti', 'The streets have already been going crazy,<br/>considering all those recent developments.')
('Bermotti', 'I hear a certain...unsavory group might be on the<br/>prowl right now.')
('Bermotti', 'Do try to be careful, please?')
('Van', "Yeah, yeah. Thanks for the heads up.<br/>(If you already know we're headin' out, you can just<br/>say so.)")
('Bermotti', "I'm hoping to see Agnès and the rest sometime soon.<br/>Don't be strangers, hear?")
('Bermotti', "A has been quite busy since the year started, don't<br/>you think?")
('Bermotti', 'The streets are buzzing with gossip. Word is, a<br/>certain unsavory group is making moves right now.')
('Bermotti', 'Do try to be careful, please?')
('Bermotti', 'By the by, I hear that your new assistant has made her<br/>official debut?')
('Bermotti', "I'd already met the Marduk concierge while we were<br/>in Tharbad, but I'd almost forgotten how much of a<br/>cutie pie she was!")
('Risette', 'You flatter me, Mr. Bermotti. I look forward to<br/>serving you however I can.')
('Bermotti', "I'll be looking forward to it, too. You know you can<br/>always count on me to help where<br/>information's concerned.")
('Bermotti', "But goodness me, Van. You're a devious devil,<br/>darling, prying such a lovely maiden from the world<br/>to slave away in that musty office of yours!")
('Van', "You should stop putting on airs if that's the kinda bad<br/>jab you're gonna come up with.")
('Bermotti', 'Aww, come on. No need to be so harsh! Trying to<br/>make myself feel a little better here. I wish I had an in<br/>with Marduk, too.')
('Risette', "(All of Mr. Arkride's acquaintances have been so nice<br/>and welcoming.)")
('Agnès', "(Right? Though I don't think he'd agree with you.)")
('Bermotti', 'How wonderful it was to see Shino come by today!')
('Bermotti', 'Business has been booming at Arkride Solutions, too.')
('Bermotti', "You two will go so far, I tell you! And I am excited to<br/>see you make it. Don't forget your old friend<br/>Bermotti when you're at the top.")
('Bermotti', "I'm not the biggest fan of rainy days. It's gloomy out,<br/>and I hate seeing everyone with a frown on their face.")
('Bermotti', 'I do hope you and Elaine are getting on okay,<br/>Van, darling.')
('Bermotti', 'What happened in Langport was quite heavy.')
('Van', "Elaine's a regular here, yeah?")
('Bermotti', "Sure is. Perfect place for you to take her on a date, if<br/>you ask me. Unless you're avoiding her, that is.")
('Bermotti', "Speaking of frowns, that's a face unsuited for them.<br/>Why don't you try and cheer her up sometime?<br/>She always looks so lonely.")
('Van', "I'd love to, but it really ain't up to me.<br/>(She'd probably just nag my ears off.)")
('Van', '(And, well...)')
('Bermotti', "That's all right, darling. I'll stay out of your<br/>private business.")
('Bermotti', "Sorry. Didn't mean to bring up such a touchy subject.")
('Van', "Nah, it's fine. I'm not really avoiding her, either.<br/>We've been runnin' into each other a lot lately.")
('Van', "(Not like that's gone well at all, but yeah...)")
('Bermotti', '(You two still have a long ways to go.)')
('Bermotti', 'I maintain a good relationship with the guild, so<br/>bracers pop in from time to time.')
('Bermotti', "I've had Zin and Elaine over, and even Kilika has<br/>come over with one of her subordinates from<br/>the CID.")
('Bermotti', 'The rest of my regular clientele is largely made up of<br/>black market merchants, gangsters, and other<br/>information brokers.')
('Van', 'Probably not a boring day in sight, eh?')
('Bermotti', "If it isn't my darling Van!")
('Bermotti', "And it's wonderful seeing you, too, Agnès.<br/>Getting used to the job, I hope.")
('Agnès', 'I am, yes.')
('Bermotti', "And how's my darling Feri doing today? Hope your<br/>job's treating you well!")
('Feri', "Yeah! It's been great!")
('Van', "She's still only workin' with me part time, mind you.")
('Van', "Look at you puttin' up the customer service face.<br/>Don't see that every day. Someone leave you a bad<br/>review or somethin'?")
('Van', "You're alarmingly overeager today. What gives?")
('Bermotti', "I can't go on and get rusty here! Need to crack out the<br/>customer service skills every now and then, you know.")
('Bermotti', "Goodness, might this be the strapping young lad I've<br/>heard so much about?")
('Aaron', "I'm Aaron Wei. You must be Bermotti.")
('Aaron', 'Jack and Halle told me about you. Said you were a<br/>top-class bartender—and information broker.')
('Bermotti', "*gasp* Mean! I can't believe Jack and Halle would just<br/>up and talk behind my back like that! That's classified<br/>info, tsk tsk.")
('Bermotti', "But I guess I'll let this one slide for you, handsome.")
('Bermotti', "I see the ambition and passion burning in those eyes.<br/>I can see why people have taken to calling you<br/>Langport's prodigy!")
('Aaron', "It's whatever. People can call me whatever the hell<br/>they want.")
('Aaron', "But I guess I should start networking here, too.<br/>I'm not in Langport anymore.")
('Aaron', "Let me know if you ever need a hand for anything.<br/>I'll scratch your back if you scratch mine.")
('Bermotti', 'Absolutely! I can do more than just give you a scratch,<br/>if you catch my drift.')
('Bermotti', '(You must be thrilled to have another promising new<br/>hire, Van, darling.)')
('Van', "(He's still on probation, so don't go inflatin' his ego<br/>too badly. I already can't hear myself think over how<br/>loud it is.)")
('Van', "Hmm?<br/>(I wonder what's going on.)")
('Bermotti', "Goodness, might this be the strapping young lad I've<br/>heard so much about?")
('Aaron', "I'm Aaron Wei. You must be Bermotti.")
('Aaron', 'Jack and Halle told me about you. Said you were a<br/>top-class bartender—and information broker.')
('Bermotti', "*gasp* Mean! I can't believe Jack and Halle would just<br/>up and talk behind my back like that! That's classified<br/>info, tsk tsk.")
('Bermotti', "But I guess I'll let this one slide for you, handsome.")
('Bermotti', "I see the ambition and passion burning in those eyes.<br/>I can see why people have taken to calling you<br/>Langport's prodigy!")
('Aaron', "It's whatever. People can call me whatever the hell<br/>they want.")
('Aaron', "But I guess I should start networking here, too.<br/>I'm not in Langport anymore.")
('Aaron', "Let me know if you ever need a hand for anything.<br/>I'll scratch your back if you scratch mine.")
('Bermotti', 'Absolutely! I can do more than just give you a scratch,<br/>if you catch my drift.')
('Bermotti', '(You must be thrilled to have another promising new<br/>hire, Van, darling.)')
('Van', "(He's still on probation, so don't go inflatin' his ego<br/>too badly. I already can't hear myself think over how<br/>loud it is.)")
('Bermotti', 'Arkride Solutions is getting livelier by the day!')
('Bermotti', "No job you won't be able to solve if you keep this<br/>hiring spree going on.")
('Van', "Shut it. I don't even want to THINK about takin' on<br/>more staff...")
('Bermotti', "You leave Edith's goings-on to me, darling. I'll let<br/>you know if I catch wind of anything juicy.")
('Bermotti', "Oh, and don't forget to bring me a souvenir! I'd never<br/>say no to some high-end liquor!")
('Van', "Aren't you demanding?")
('Bermotti', 'Welcome, welcome! Is this your new little helper?')
('Bermotti', "My, you're even cuter than I'd heard! Any more<br/>pretty things like us on Van's arm and we'll have to<br/>start up our own club, won't we, Ferida?")
('Feri', "Oh, for sure!<br/>(...So he'd be in the club, too?)")
('Van', "C'mon, you out to confuse ALL my part-timers?")
('Agnès', 'I know I was certainly confused when he said you two<br/>had a special relationship, ahaha.')
('Agnès', 'By the way, Bermotti. Do you have any new leads?')
('Bermotti', 'Look at you, Agnès! Growing into your role of<br/>assistant quite nicely, are you?')
('Bermotti', "I don't have much in the way of new info, but I may<br/>have something to share with our new recruit here.")
('Bermotti', 'I heard that the Kruga corps are en route to the<br/>Central East. The Eisenschild have returned<br/>home, too.')
('Bermotti', 'They took on a new job already. One of their units is<br/>on the move as we speak.')
('Feri', "Really? Wait—and it's already international news?")
('Van', "I wouldn't call it that. Info like that is Bermotti's<br/>bread and butter.")
('Van', "You ain't gonna get better info in all of Edith.<br/>There's a reason I let this jerk harass me.")
('Feri', 'Oh, okay! Then we can come here anytime we<br/>need information!')
('Bermotti', "I'm more than just an informant, you know!")
('Bermotti', "I guess I'll let it slide for you, missy. But only 'cause<br/>you're such a cutie pie, I couldn't be mad at you.")
('Bermotti', 'With Calvard being the largest country in the<br/>continent, lots of information passes through<br/>the capital.')
('Bermotti', 'Come by and give me a visit if you ever<br/>need anything! Even if that anything is just more of<br/>yours truly.')
('Feri', "Okay! I'll come by later, then!")
('Bermotti', "It's been ten days since the incident. The streets are<br/>finally returning to normal.")
('Bermotti', "I'd be more than happy to help if you need<br/>anything else. Stop by and visit anytime, hear?")
('Bermotti', 'My, my! Glad to have you join us today, Van!<br/>We needed a few more cuties to round out the Cuties<br/>Club meeting.')
('Van', "Heya. And hi, Shino. Didn't expect to catch<br/>you here. Feels weird seein' you on the other side of<br/>the counter.")
('Shino', "Today's my day off, actually.")
('Shino', 'I figured I would take the chance to congratulate my<br/>former boss on winning runner-up in his<br/>bartending competition.')
('Bermotti', 'Oh, please. I told you not to fuss about that.<br/>Your presence is all I need.')
('Shino', "Is that so? Well, maybe I'll stop by more often, then. ♪")
('Agnès', 'Congratulations again, Bermotti!')
('Agnès', 'I had no idea you two were friends, or that Shino<br/>used to work for you.')
('Bermotti', 'That she did, and what a pleasant half a year it was!<br/>My sharp eyes immediately noticed her potential as<br/>a bartender.')
('Bermotti', "I know you've been really busy since you went solo,<br/>Shino, dear, but I know it's nothing you can't handle.")
('Bermotti', 'I hope you have just as much faith in your abilities as<br/>I do. Someone like you deserves to make a name<br/>for herself.')
('Shino', 'Oh.')
('Shino', "Thank you, Bermotti. For everything. I'll keep working<br/>hard, and maybe next time I'll have something to show<br/>for it.")
('Van', "(That pep talk sure perked her up. Good. She's got a<br/>lot of potential in her.)")
('Van', 'Dingo? What are you doing here?')
('Bermotti', 'Good to see you, Van, darling! Long day, yeah?')
('Dingo', 'I just finished work a bit ago and was taking some<br/>time to check my messages.')
('Dingo', "I'll be sure to send you any info I dig up around Edith<br/>straight away while you're gone.")
('Van', "'Preciate you cuttin' to the chase. This is Almata I'm<br/>dealin' with, after all.")
('Van', "They're on Heiyue turf. If Heiyue's guys can handle it<br/>on their own until Cao gets back, things should<br/>be fine.")
('Bermotti', "The White Orchid Dragon's been popping up a lot as<br/>of late.")
('Bermotti', "I wouldn't rest on my laurels on this one, Van.<br/>If Cao's the one asking, things are bound to get ugly.")
('Van', "Tch. Can't a man hope for an easy job every now<br/>and then?")
('Dingo', 'Hmm. The Lu family should be trustworthy to a<br/>certain degree...')
('Dingo', "...but don't let your guard down. You'll be taking your<br/>new assistants into the Heiyue snake pit, after all.")
('Dingo', "Though if you get in a bind, you know who you can<br/>turn to. I'm sure he hasn't lost his edge after all<br/>these years.")
('Van', "Yeah, I was plannin' on reaching out to him anyway.<br/>I just hope he hasn't drunk himself into the gutter.")
('Bermotti', "Ooh, I know who we're talking about! I met him<br/>myself a year or so back.")
('Bermotti', "You won't find him at the bottom of a bottle<br/>for once! That cute little assistant of his got him<br/>behaving for once.")
('Van', "And I ain't letting him live that down once I get<br/>to Langport.")
('Van', "Might just be what I need to turn my losin' streak<br/>around and let him have a taste of his own medicine.")
('Dingo', "(Like you're any different. Agnès has you on a tighter<br/>leash, too.)")
('Bermotti', '(He and Van are almost like peas in a pod, and<br/>neither of them would ever realize—or admit it.)')
('Renne', 'Pleasure to see you again, Van.')
('Bermotti', 'Good on you for coming, darling! We just got<br/>started here.')
('Van', "And I'm on my way out.")
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Haha! Come on, Arkride. Why not join us for a<br/>little chat?')
('Walter the Direwolf', "Haven't seen you since Oración. I bet we got loads to<br/>catch up on.")
('Van', 'How about no.')
('Van', "A temporary truce doesn't mean I'm lookin' to make<br/>friends with you.")
('Van', "'Sides, I'm still pissed at the pay cut I took because<br/>of you.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Sorry, nothing you can do 'bout that. It was the big<br/>dog's decision. Compensation for me and<br/>Lucrezia's troubles. I'm sure you understand.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "I'm supposed to tell you it wasn't payback for messin'<br/>with his plan.")
('Renne', 'How very like him.')
('Bermotti', "I've heard the rumors. He definitely makes<br/>an impression!")
('Van', "We had our fun, but I ain't looking to make friends.")
('Van', "My thanks go as far as you sendin' over the full<br/>payment for the Oración gig.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Heh. The boss enjoyed himself a fair bit. Don't be<br/>surprised if you see a neat little bonus come your way.")
('Walter the Direwolf', 'He was gonna pay you anyway, whether you figured<br/>out his plan or not.')
('Bermotti', "Oh. But if he hadn't...")
('Renne', "Van here would've sadly found himself too...<br/>indisposed to enjoy his paycheck.")
('Van', 'The hell is his problem?!')
('Van', "You look like a saint by comparison! Bastard didn't<br/>even care about all those lives, did he?")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Like Retzy and I were sayin', that guy's pure poison.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "That Dantès, though. Now there's a real son of<br/>a bitch.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "That Dantès, though. Now there's a real son of<br/>a bitch.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Bastard's in a league all of his own—even when<br/>compared to an Anguis.")
('Van', "You're joking.")
('Bermotti', "Oh, I feel faint. I'm not sure how much more I can<br/>take hearing about him before my heart gives out...")
('Renne', "While I'm no saint, it's a small comfort knowing I<br/>don't quite compare to the heights of this madman.")
('Renne', "For a lapdog, you sure do love pulling at your<br/>master's leash.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "It'll slip right out of his hands soon enough.")
('Van', 'Please keep me far, FAR away from that business<br/>whenever that happens.')
('Bermotti', "My, my, this info is solid gold! Too bad I'll have to<br/>keep mum about it, or I might not enjoy my life for<br/>much longer.")
('Van', "Are that walkin' disaster of a man and the Golden<br/>Butterfly in Edith?")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Who knows? I haven't heard from 'em since Oración.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Probably out, reporting to the big boss. Don't get<br/>comfortable, though. Can't imagine they're gonna<br/>keep away for long.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "This year's Revolution Festival is shaping up to be<br/>quite the spectacle, eh?")
('Van', 'Son of a bitch.')
('Bermotti', "It's been the talk of the town as of late.")
('Renne', 'Do you mean about Calvard finally overtaking<br/>Erebonia in terms of sheer power?')
('Renne', 'President Gramheart is many things, but a boring<br/>man he is not.')
('Van', "That's one way of puttin' it.")
('Van', "By the way, weren't you goin' back to the dorms<br/>with Agnès?")
('Van', "Shouldn't you be studying or somethin'? Lot more<br/>interesting stuff to do with life than hang out with<br/>this bag of bones.")
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Watch it, Arkride.')
('Renne', 'Walter reached out to me right after I arrived.')
('Renne', "He has some information I'm interested in hearing,<br/>so I figured a meetup would be worthwhile.")
('Renne', "And you needn't worry. I made sure to file the proper<br/>curfew extension, so I can stay out as late as I please.")
('Van', "The hell kinda school are they even runnin'<br/>in there?!")
('Bermotti', 'Calm yourself, Van, darling.')
('Walter the Direwolf', "No need to get your panties in a bunch. 'S not like<br/>I'm takin' her drinking or anything, so don't worry<br/>about that.")
('Cocona', 'Huh? Where am I...? Wait! Wh-What date is it?!')
('Cronin', "You're hardly halfway out of slumberland...<br/>Anyway, don't worry, Ms. Cocona. You just focus<br/>on getting your rest in.")
('Cronin', "I'll stand watch and protect you!")
('Cocona', "Hmm... Y'will? Great... Zzz...")
('Cocona', 'Zzz... Zzz...')
('Cocona', 'Mmm... Yes... Bow to me, my servants... Heh...')
('Cocona', "This year-end special's taking FOREVER<br/>to storyboard. I can't even figure out the<br/>panel layouts...")
('Cocona', 'Why do I have to work on the day of the festival?!<br/>Ugh! Cronin, you slave driver!')
('Cocona', "First some monaka and chocolate pudding, and then<br/>I'll grab some crêpes and donuts! This dinner will be<br/>the BEST!")
('Van', '(Oh, shit. That sounds like a nice dinner idea to me.)')
('Aaron', "(Of course it does. If you're a five-year-old.)")
('Feri', "(I'm getting heartburn just thinking about it...)")
('Agnès', '(You should really try to eat something<br/>more balanced...)')
('Cronin', 'Please feel free to consult me before submitting your<br/>next chapter storyboard, Ms. Cocona.')
('Cocona', '(Hmm... I might be able to make a killer storyboard if<br/>Cronin writes the script for me.)')
('Cocona', "This is one of my favorite cafés. It'd be just perfect if<br/>they extended their hours just a little more.")
('Cocona', 'Heehee, time to kick back and draw at my own pace.<br/>Deadlines be damned!')
('Cronin', "M-Ms. Cocona! You're NOT gonna<br/>believe this!")
('Cocona', 'Oh, Goddess. Do I even wanna hear about it?')
('Cronin', "You remember that readers' choice poll I brought up<br/>the other day? You won first place!")
('Cronin', "And that's not all! The editorial department's been<br/>flooded with fan mail! Congratulations!")
('Cocona', 'Oh, really? Huh... Heh heh...')
('Cocona', 'Just goes to show all my work finally paid off!')
('Cocona', 'Thank you so much for your support all this<br/>time, Cronin! I owe you one.')
('Cronin', "Haha, but I didn't do anything! This was all<br/>you, Ms. Cocona.")
('Cronin', 'Speaking of which, I look forward to seeing what you<br/>cook up for your year-end special!')
('Cocona', 'Huh? Special what now?')
('Cronin', 'Oh, did I not mention that part? The grand prize<br/>winner gets to have a one-shot special published!')
('Cocona', 'WHAAAAAAT?!')
('Cronin', 'Think you can get us sixteen pages in three days?')
('Cocona', "No, I DON'T, actually! What the hell, Cronin?!<br/>You jerk!")
('Cronin', "P-Please don't be mad! I-I'll do everything I can to<br/>help you through it!")
('Cronin', "I can't believe Mia would escape all on her own.")
('Cronin', "I didn't see that one coming! Superheroes are so<br/>darned cool!")
('Cocona', "I mean, I couldn't let the story be all bleak.<br/>It needed a little hope.")
('Cocona', "Is that bad? Maybe people don't wanna read about a<br/>happy and hopeful story with the way things<br/>are now...")
('Cronin', "What are you talking about, Ms. Cocona? We're<br/>still talking about comics, yeah?")
('Cronin', "Now's the PERFECT time for kids to be getting<br/>some hope through these comics!")
('Cocona', 'Umm...')
('Cocona', "Y-You're right! I'll keep writing it, just the way I want<br/>it to be!")
('Cocona', 'And here I thought you were too dense to understand<br/>people at all, Cronin.')
('Cronin', 'Where did THAT come from?! Did I say<br/>something weird?!')
('Cocona', "(Hmm. You might be a little dense, still, but I guess<br/>that's what makes you, you.)")
('Cronin', 'I have something important to share with you<br/>today, Ms. Cocona.')
('Cocona', "Wh-What's up?<br/>(Oh, Goddess—is his contract getting renewed?<br/>Please, no!)")
('Cronin', "We're holding a readers' choice poll over the next<br/>week to determine what our most popular title is.")
('Cronin', "There's a good chance Bravely Legends will be up<br/>amongst the top ranks.")
('Cronin', "No—I'm certain it will be first! So let's make sure<br/>your next chapter is the best one yet!")
('Cocona', 'Umm...')
('Cocona', "I actually thought I might do a nice, uplifting<br/>chapter next. I've got the storyboard here if you<br/>wanna take a look?")
('Cronin', 'B-But what about the climactic fight against the<br/>evil organization?!')
('Cocona', 'I thought it might be nice to ease off the gas a<br/>little, story-wise. I could certainly use the break.')
('Cronin', "I might be overstepping here, but don't you think this<br/>isn't the best time to diverge from the plot?")
('Cronin', "We need to see Mia rescued from the enemy's<br/>clutches at least!")
('Cronin', 'I got something that will cheer you up,<br/>Ms. Cocona!')
('Cocona', "I don't think there's a single thing you can do today<br/>that'll make me smile.")
('Cronin', "Okay. Guess I'll have to dispose of this six-year-old's<br/>passionate fan letter to you.")
('Cocona', "You're joking!")
('Cronin', "'Dear Ms. Cocona. I love the heroes you draw in<br/>your story.'")
('Cronin', "'Akira is my favorite! He's so cool! I wanna be just<br/>like him when I grow up!'")
('Cocona', 'Oh, my heart! I loved hearing that so much!<br/>Even despite the humongous child that read it to me!')
('Cronin', "Haha! Well, now we can't disappoint him with next<br/>week's issue!")
('Cocona', '*sniffle* Just think of all the cute, little boys out there<br/>waiting for a new chapter...')
('Cronin', "Phew. Guess this means we won't have to skip the<br/>storyboarding process after all!")
('Cronin', "You've got this, Ms. Cocona! If you don't advance<br/>the plot, we'll never get to see the climactic battle<br/>with the evil organization!")
('Cocona', "Y-You're not helping! Ugh... I'm having a hard time<br/>coming up with anything!")
('Cocona', 'I might get inspired if I had some cherry pie...<br/>And maybe a parfait! Oooh, pancakes, too!')
('Cronin', "I-I hear you loud and clear! Don't worry—it'll be<br/>my treat!")
('Cronin', 'These drawings are some of your best work, Ms.<br/>Cocona! The heat of combat comes across so well<br/>in them!')
('Cronin', "But there are a couple parts that don't make sense<br/>to me. Like this cut here. Why are they suddenly<br/>playing tic-tac-toe?")
('Cocona', "It's a joke.")
('Cocona', "Sometimes I get tired of drawing all the action during<br/>the fight scenes, so I put in a joke here and there.<br/>Y'know, helps liven the mood!")
('Cronin', '...')
('Cronin', "Sorry, Ms. Cocona. I guess I just don't get it.")
('Cronin', "Your comic's serialized in a magazine for boys.<br/>Shouldn't it be straightforward and action-packed?")
('Cocona', "Yeah, you're not wrong... Guess it's back to the<br/>drawing board for me.")
('Cronin', "Oh, good. I finally found you, Ms. Cocona! I was<br/>worried when I saw you weren't at work!")
('Cocona', 'Eek! Cronin?! I-I, umm, was just brainstorming some<br/>new ideas!')
('Cronin', "Is that so? You've been hard at work in here...")
('Cronin', "...while I was running around wasting time looking<br/>for you! I'm so sorry for being so useless.")
('Cronin', "I know—I'll make up for it by staying with you all day<br/>to help work on your next storyboard!")
('Cocona', '(No! Why is this happening?! I was trying to<br/>AVOID you!)')
('Cocona', "Why are you always wearing a suit, Cronin?<br/>It's weird!")
('Cronin', 'It is? I guess I never really thought about it that way.<br/>I just think it makes me look more dedicated to<br/>my job!')
('Cocona', '(Why did my editor have to be such a pain in<br/>the ass?)')
('Cronin', "(I'm not sure why she's glaring daggers at me. Did<br/>I offend her?)")
('Cronin', "Looks like things calmed down a little. You sure don't<br/>see stuff like that every day...")
('Cronin', 'Anyway, be careful out there, everyone!')
('Cronin', "Everyone pins their hopes on heroes like yourselves.<br/>It wouldn't work as well if you came to harm!")
('Cronin', "I-Is this actually happening?! It's like a comic scene<br/>come to life!")
('Cronin', 'Who cares about comic books?! I need to protect<br/>Ms. Cocona!')
('Cronin', 'Finishing that script really took it out of me—I<br/>completely zonked out!')
('Cronin', "I sure hope Ms. Cocona's draft will get to the<br/>editing room soon.")
('Cronin', "Argh, I'm tired of being stuck in here!")
('Cronin', "I'm so sorry, Ms. Cocona! I'll make it up to you!<br/>Let's go to your favorite café—my treat!")
('Cocona', "I don't think so.")
('Cocona', "I'm not going ANYWHERE unless there's a child<br/>with rosy-red cheeks coming along!")
('Cronin', "Huh?! But I'm still a bachelor! I can't just produce<br/>a kid from nothing!")
('Cronin', '(Ugh... I know this was my idea...)')
('Cronin', '(...but all these sweets are starting to make me sick.)')
('Cronin', 'Believe it or not, Ms. Cocona is a renowned comic<br/>book artist.')
('Cronin', 'She acts very laid back, but her stories are full of<br/>action-packed battle scenes!')
('Cronin', "It's my responsibility as her editor to support her, no<br/>matter what! I do it for the sake of all the children<br/>waiting for each new episode!")
('Van', "Nice seein' you in one piece, old man!")
('Bradley', "Yeah. Don't even got a scratch on me.")
('Bradley', "Though I'm a bit worried about Junifer and the rest.<br/>They left a while ago.")
('Bradley', "At least they took the cars. They're great drivers, so<br/>I'm sure they should be fine.")
('Van', "I'm sure they'll be fine.")
('Aaron', "Let's get going. We got places to be.")
('Bradley', "I ain't so sure what you're planning, but I trust you.")
('Bradley', "Get goin' then. Take one of the cars if you need to.")
('Bradley', "Just stay frosty, yeah? Go show those brutes<br/>who's boss!")
('Bradley', 'Buncha damned fools...')
('Bradley', "Don't get carried away just 'cause the festival's<br/>goin' on. Ya hear me, Van?")
('Van', "I won't.")
('Van', "('Fools,' huh? Wonder where Junifer and the others<br/>are up to.)")
('Bradley', "I doubt it'll take much work. She seems to be taking<br/>pretty good care of it herself.")
('Bradley', "Well, can't have her throwing a tantrum. A nice wax<br/>finish can't hurt.")
('Bradley', "Don't whine to me if you can't figure it out.")
('Bradley', 'Get along then—off to the next stop with you.')
('Bradley', "She's not quite there yet, but she's coming along.")
('Bradley', "Junifer's the hands-on type, so it's best to let her learn<br/>by throwing her into the fray.")
('Bradley', '*sigh* I just hope this is a decent learning experience<br/>for her.')
('Bradley', "I finally came across a decent used engine. I've been<br/>huntin' one for a while.")
('Bradley', "Junifer there said she'd be willin' to work for free for<br/>a year. It's an offer I couldn't turn down, so I signed<br/>her on.")
('Bradley', "But I don't intend on tightening a single screw<br/>for her.")
('Bradley', "She's doing all the oil changes and maintenance by<br/>herself from here on out.")
('Bradley', "Bein' a top-class mechanic's harder than it looks.<br/>It requires mental fortitude on top of<br/>technical know-how.")
('Bradley', 'Well, I guess I could lend a hand if she asks for it.')
('Bradley', "It's not like I'll just ignore her if she asks for advice.<br/>I'm her trainer, after all.")
('Bradley', "Ah, great. She's throwin' another fit.")
('Bradley', 'Gotta admit, her driving skills have come a long way.<br/>She could stand to learn how to behave, though.')
('Junifer', 'Braaadleeey! Come ooonn!')
('Bradley', "Hey, knock that off! You ain't five years old, so<br/>behave yourself!")
('Bradley', "I get that I fixed their cars and everything, but they<br/>don't gotta make such a big deal about it.")
('Bradley', "Hey, now. Don't make a scene in front of the shop.")
('Bradley', 'And be careful out on the road!')
('Bradley', 'I heard they had quite the joy ride out there.')
('Bradley', "I should've told 'em to go easier on the gas. It's all fun<br/>and games until the cops show up.")
('Bradley', "But oh, well. Ain't gonna go rain on their parade.<br/>Let 'em rip, I say.")
('Bradley', "You can probably tell from how quiet it is 'round<br/>here, but Junifer and her buddies are out on the<br/>road tonight.")
('Bradley', "I heard everyone talkin' about this other team they<br/>were gonna race against.")
('Bradley', "Engines revved, blood pumpin', the cold breeze on<br/>your face. Ah, youth.")
('Bradley', "Wish cars like these were 'round when I was<br/>their age.")
('Bradley', 'No sign of the usual suspects today.')
('Bradley', "Not like it's any of my business what they get up<br/>to anyhow.")
('Van', "Junifer and the crew? Sure, guess I worry about<br/>'em some.")
('Bradley', "Worry's wasted on the reckless.")
('Bradley', "Junifer and Graham, well... They eat, sleep, and<br/>breathe street racin'.")
('Bradley', "One mistake is all it takes in that world. Just 'cause<br/>you're goin' fast doesn't mean life won't catch up<br/>to ya.")
('Bradley', 'Big shots will slip up every now and then. Not even<br/>pros can avoid it.')
('Van', '(Sometimes I forget Bradley used to be chief<br/>mechanic for a Z1 team.)')
('Van', "(Must've seen some shit before quittin'.)")
('Bradley', 'By the by, ya got your hands on a rare part, yeah?')
('Van', "Sure did. A custom Nightbreaker part. Don't worry—<br/>there's no one else I'd come to get it installed at.")
('Bradley', 'Bring it by anytime, lad. Got plenty of<br/>openings today.')
('Bradley', 'Would be plenty swell if Junifer learned how to back<br/>off a little.')
('Bradley', "That girl's a thorn in my side.")
('Bradley', "This here's a limited edition '98 ETWS. It's got a real<br/>swell custom engine.")
('Bradley', 'While Verne supplies engines for the four big car<br/>manufacturers, they handle their own tune-ups.')
('Bradley', "It ain't yer standard ETWS engine. Baby's more in<br/>line with an Ingert's.")
('Agnès', "I'm aware that ETWS focuses more on luxury cars<br/>while Ingert leads the sports car market.")
('Feri', 'ET—what now? Are they the ones that make all the<br/>luxury limousines?')
('Feri', "Van's truck was like an 'Egret,' or something<br/>like that...")
('Aaron', "ETWS is the cream of the crop of luxury cars<br/>for sure. I've never even been in one.")
('Aaron', "Does Ingert make anything that's not a sports car?")
('Van', "Ingert specializes in sports cars, but that ain't all<br/>they make. They got other models, too.")
('Van', "Old man Bradley here used to be chief engineer over<br/>at Ingert. You ain't gonna find anyone that knows<br/>more than he does.")
('Bradley', "Don't go inflatin' my ego, now. It's been forever and a<br/>day since I had that gig.")
('Bradley', 'Each of the four big car manufacturers has their own<br/>design philosophies.')
('Bradley', "I may be an Ingert man, but I ain't afraid to get my<br/>hands dirty under the hood of another company's car.")
('Bradley', "Cars ain't some wacko magic. It's just science.<br/>A buncha movin' parts whose job at the end of the<br/>day is to get that machine runnin'.")
('Bradley', "Off that bunch goes, drivin' without a care in<br/>the world.")
('Bradley', "What a buncha punks. They keep this up, someone's<br/>gonna get hurt.")
('Van', 'Worried about Junifer, old man?')
('Bradley', "Hah, don't make me laugh. Anything happens to her,<br/>she'll have it comin'.")
('Bradley', "A driver that can't take care of their own ass has no<br/>business behind the wheel.")
('Van', "(Harsh, but he's got a point.)")
('Bradley', "Scavengin' for parts again, huh? You've sure put a lot<br/>of work into that Nightbreaker of yours.")
('Bradley', "Ya sure you ain't goin' overboard? You ain't got the<br/>deepest pockets in town, y'know.")
('Van', "Ugh. Don't remind me. But she still ain't on par with<br/>the old one. Mira's temporary, but my devotion<br/>is eternal!")
('Bradley', 'Geez. Fix up the car all you want—what ya really<br/>need is a tuneup on that junker between yer ears.')
('Bradley', "Dunno how, but somehow along the way, Junifer up<br/>an' became a car freak. It was not my doin'.")
('Bradley', 'I need to keep a close eye on her while she works.')
('Bradley', "Tinkerin' with a car without the proper know-how<br/>can get you hurt—or worse. She still needs a lotta<br/>babyin' here.")
('Bradley', "She's always yappin' about one thing or another.<br/>I can't keep up with 'er.")
('Bradley', "Honestly, these rare aerodynamic parts are goin' to<br/>waste on a car like that.")
('Bradley', "I'd get it if she was tryin' to deck out a Z1 car, but<br/>she isn't.")
('Junifer', 'Aww, yeah! Finally finished in here!')
('Junifer', 'Engine replacement done!')
('Bradley', "(Well, doesn't she look pleased as punch.)")
('Bradley', "Hold it there—you ain't done just yet.")
('Junifer', 'It looks pretty done to me!')
('Bradley', "But it's not. I told you before that if you wire<br/>everything to the orbal system like that, the balance<br/>will be all outta whack.")
('Bradley', "This ain't yer run-of-the-mill Kabul anymore, so you<br/>can't go treatin' it like one.")
('Junifer', "O-Oh! Right on, boss! I'll fix it up in a jiffy!")
('Van', "(She plannin' on pullin' an all-nighter?)")
('Van', "(Welp. Better get used to it if she's gonna be workin'<br/>for the old man.)")
('Junifer', "Here you go! A cup of your favorite coffee!<br/>And how're ya feelin'? Need a shoulder rub?<br/>Back massage? Just gotta ask!")
('Bradley', "You either ain't the Junifer I know, or there's<br/>something yer after. Now spill.")
('Junifer', "Nope! I'm not after anything. At. All! I just wanted<br/>you to know how much I appreciate you!")
('Junifer', "Is it bad that I want to repay the kindness you've<br/>shown me?")
('Bradley', "No, but it's bad to get all up in my personal space<br/>like that! Shoo!")
('Van', "(Family, all right. Barkin' at each other all the time,<br/>but at least they still get along.)")
('Junifer', "Hey there, Van! Who's the cutie?")
('Van', "Hey, Junifer. How're you and the old man?")
('Agnès', "I hope we're not interrupting.")
('Agnès', "I've never been to an auto repair shop.")
('Bradley', "Then mighty pleased to meet ya, young lass. We take<br/>care of car repairs and customization jobs alike in 'ere.")
('Bradley', "It ain't much, but feel free to take a look around if<br/>you're interested.")
('Agnès', 'Thank you, sir.')
('Van', "What're you up to this time? Another tire switch?<br/>Dang. Ever heard of brand loyalty?")
('Junifer', "Nope! If I'm not happy with a part, it ain't goin' in<br/>my car! And I gotta fix the suspension anyway.")
('Agnès', '(Van looked like he was having fun with that<br/>magazine earlier. He really must like cars.)')
('Bradley', "Don't pay 'em any mind. You'll need an oil change<br/>before they shut up.")
('Bradley', "C'mon, you two! You talk business, or you<br/>talk outta my shop!")
('Junifer', "C'mon, Uncle! I can totally pimp it up with some<br/>aerodynamic parts!")
('Bradley', "With what mira? Go on, get goin' home, you!")
('Agnès', "Oh, I didn't know they were related.")
('Van', 'That they are, though they act more like cats<br/>and dogs.')
('Van', "The old man's an expert on the field. Used to be a<br/>mechanic for Ingert.")
('Van', "Junifer here is his niece. She's been mentorin' under<br/>him for a while now, and working part time at<br/>his shop.")
('Junifer', 'And I get to buy all the parts I want thanks to<br/>this job!')
('Junifer', 'What do you think of my baby here? Pretty bomb for<br/>a Kabul, if I do say so myself!')
('Bradley', "Bah. No point in customizin' a ride that won't<br/>pass inspection. Ya better stop spendin' money you<br/>don't got.")
('Junifer', 'And whose fault is that, huh?! Maybe you should give<br/>me a raise, then!')
('Van', 'You two are related, all right.')
('Agnès', '(Everyone here looks like they know a lot about cars.)')
('Agnès', "(And Van's a regular, it looks like. Maybe he has a car<br/>of his own?)")
('Junifer', "Seein' everyone drive like that today gave a whole<br/>buncha new ideas to try and pull off myself!")
('Junifer', 'I still have a long way to go if I want to be a<br/>good driver. And, of course, if I want a sick ride!')
('Junifer', "Nothing's gonna stop me from being a racer!")
('Junifer', "Time to hunker down and start learnin' these<br/>racing rules! After that, I gotta pick a partner!")
('Junifer', "For today's race, we're gonna need to go all in, no<br/>holds barred!")
('Junifer', "I'll get it all up and runnin', so you just worry about<br/>flexin' those driver muscles today!")
('Junifer', "Leave 'em eatin' dust! I know you're just as pumped<br/>for this as I am!")
('Junifer', "Did you enjoy 'Van Appreciation Day'? I bet it<br/>was cool! Wish I could've joined.")
('Van', "C'mon, don't call it that. It's embarrassing. Even if it's<br/>not that far off...")
('Van', "Thanks for washin' my truck, and sorry you got<br/>wrapped up in all the, er, 'appreciating.'")
('Junifer', "Don't mention it! Least I could do for a<br/>drivin' buddy!")
('Junifer', "Don't worry about takin' her back—I'll drive her<br/>home once I'm done with this shiny new wax finish!")
('Junifer', 'Looks like the Van Appreciation party went off<br/>without a hitch!')
('Junifer', "I'll drive your truck over to your garage once I'm done<br/>washin' her. Look forward to seein' that sexy new<br/>wax job!")
('Junifer', "I'm gonna give your truck a new wax finish. Get ready<br/>to see her shine better than ever!")
('Junifer', "Ahh, I can't wait to get behind the wheel of my<br/>new Kabul!")
('Junifer', "The pedal's about to really hit the metal!")
('Junifer', 'Woohoo! I finally found it! Finally gonna get to<br/>install my brand new engine!')
('Van', 'N-No way! Really?!')
('Van', "Damn. I'm green with envy... How did you even find<br/>an engine that fit?")
('Van', "I'm pretty sure your car's only meant to take its exact<br/>custom engine. Must've been a tough find.")
('Junifer', "Heh heh! Not as tough when you got my uncle's<br/>know-how and my mechanical prowess!")
('Junifer', "Weight distribution's gonna be waaay different, but<br/>this'll put me in another class on the track anyway!")
('Junifer', "Just you sit tight, my little Kabul. You're about to be<br/>the hottest comet on the circuit!")
('Agnès', '(Haha, her excitement is infectious.)')
('Van', "(Can't blame her. Ain't gonna be long before my<br/>sweet little Nightbreaker gets the same treatment.)")
('Aaron', "(And off you go. You're like a kid that won't shut up<br/>about their toys. Oversized toys.)")
('Junifer', "My darling Kabul is finally gonna get a<br/>serious upgrade! I can't wait!")
('Junifer', "But my uncle said he wouldn't help me here.")
('Junifer', "So it's all up to me here! Don't worry, darlin'!<br/>I'll make you shine!")
('Junifer', "Everyone's takin' a break right now, so I've just been<br/>cooped up in here. Man, I could go out for a drive<br/>right now...")
('Junifer', "*sigh* I guess that's just life for ya. All I can do is busy<br/>myself around the shop and save up my mira.")
('Junifer', "(Wait, isn't this guy, like, super famous or somethin'?!<br/>What the heck is he doin' HERE?!)")
('Junifer', '(Hot damn, I need to find something for him to sign!<br/>ASAP!)')
('Junifer', "C'mooon, Uncle! I just wanna replace<br/>my engine!")
('Junifer', "It's the only way I'm gonna get max<br/>performance out of my Kabul!")
('Bradley', 'Goddess be, would ya knock it off?! Go on and annoy<br/>someone else!')
('Junifer', "Pleeease! I'll cough up the mira—I just need your<br/>help findin' the right engine!")
('Bradley', "That's the problem! Do you even understand how<br/>hard it'll be to find somethin' that'll even FIT?")
('Junifer', "Losing's such a bummer.")
('Junifer', "But it's not all bad! I got to let loose and drive my<br/>heart out! Ohh, that felt so good! My little baby's the<br/>best car in town!")
('Junifer', "(I'd love to go on a road trip with Graham, but I can't<br/>swing it.)")
('Junifer', "(All of my paychecks have been goin' straight to<br/>car parts. I could straight up declare bankruptcy<br/>on myself.)")
('Junifer', "(Not to mention I'll never hear the end of it if my<br/>uncle gets wind of the idea.)")
('Van', 'Oh! Is that the new fall catalog with the latest<br/>car models?!')
('Junifer', 'Welcome! And yup! Sharp as ever. Got all the newest<br/>models from every manufacturer!')
('Junifer', "Check out this Red Star! Engine's got a horsepower<br/>of over four hundred! Price just about matches it, too!")
('Van', "Heard they did a test drive at the launch press event.<br/>Man, what I wouldn't give to get a chance behind the<br/>wheel of one of those puppies.")
('Junifer', "Ditto! Ingert and Leno forgive me, but I'll totally<br/>cheat on my favorites with one of these babies!")
('Agnès', 'Haha... Sounds like the event was a must for car fans.')
('Feri', "I don't get it, but if you're happy, then I'm happy<br/>for you!")
('Aaron', "I wouldn't mind getting my hands on one, but I don't<br/>have the money to cough up for it.")
('Junifer', "Got a real hankering for checkin' out some new cars!")
('Junifer', "I sooo wanna check out the motor pavilion in Basel.<br/>That's where the Verne Company is based.")
('Junifer', "Maybe Graham and everyone else would be up for<br/>comin' with me?")
('Junifer', "We're just about to take our cars out!")
('Junifer', "Doin' a little drag racin' with friends. You up for<br/>it, Van?")
('Van', "Don't got time for that sort of thing when you're fully<br/>grown, kid.")
('Van', "But hey, have a good time. Don't go gettin' in any<br/>wrecks, hear?")
('Junifer', "Heh, I sure ain't plannin' on it!")
('Junifer', 'Time to floor it!')
('Junifer', "Downey's always keepin' up with all the latest car<br/>models and whatnot. I should go see what he thinks!")
('Junifer', "I'm cleaning the engine bays of used cars today!")
('Junifer', "*sigh* I need to be real careful about maintenance<br/>when it comes to Uncle. He's real strict about work.")
('Junifer', "You know, we started servicing orbal bikes recently,<br/>so I'll need to learn how to work on those, too.")
('Van', "That one over there's a Red Star, yeah? Looks a bit<br/>below the Direwolf's ride, but only barely.")
('Feri', "But it's still so cool looking! Maybe we can try<br/>riding it?")
('Junifer', "Haha, you need a license first, kiddo! But I bet you'd<br/>be a natural at it if you could ride one.")
('Junifer', "Not many people own bikes yet, so we're gonna start<br/>renting 'em out here.")
('Agnès', "Even if we can't ride one now, I'd love to try it<br/>out someday.")
('Van', "They ain't goin' anywhere, so we can come back if we<br/>ever get the chance.")
('Junifer', "Well, I've got a long road of learnin' ahead of me, but<br/>the first step is making sure I don't screw up<br/>the basics!")
('Junifer', "By the by, a lot of the used cars we service here are<br/>gettin' shipped outside the country.")
('Junifer', "Guess everyone's raring to get their hands on a<br/>Republic car!")
('Junifer', 'Ohh, listen to that baby purr! Leave it to Uncle to<br/>work his magic!')
('Junifer', "I'd say it's time to slay the expressway and go<br/>full throttle!")
('Agnès', "'Slay'? Are you sure that's not dangerous?")
('Van', "Nah, don't worry about her. Think about it as just<br/>racer lingo.")
('Van', "Junifer's crew ain't got a reckless driver in sight.")
('Junifer', "I'm supposed to go racin' with Graham and the<br/>crew later.")
('Junifer', "I've installed some new parts, so I'll just need to give<br/>'er a tuneup before headin' out!")
('Junifer', "All right, might as well get that squared away while<br/>Uncle's not looking!")
('Junifer', "I'm tryin' my best out there, Graham!")
('Junifer', "I'm slayin' those corners, getting better at staying in<br/>my lane!")
('Junifer', "But my Kabul still won't cut it against those darned<br/>High Bloods!")
('Graham', 'I-I hear you, Junifer. Just take a deep breath.')
('Graham', "(Junifer's still pretty wound up about losing that race.<br/>Goes to show she's taking things seriously, at least.)")
('Graham', "(It's not skill that's holding her back—it's her car.<br/>She's a great driver in her own right.)")
('Graham', "(But there's not a lot to really be done when it comes<br/>to her car...)")
('Junifer', 'Grahaaam!')
('Graham', "(Her Kabul's no slouch, but it's still bein' left in the<br/>dust despite all the work she's put into it.)")
('Graham', '(At that point, all you can really do is get a new ride.)')
('Graham', '(Or maybe... Hmm. We might not need to give it up<br/>just yet.)')
('Junifer', "Look at you. Actin' like hot stuff earlier, but you<br/>finally mellowed out some.")
('Junifer', 'What happened? Felt lonely at the top of the world,<br/>Your Majesty?')
('Lucio', 'Something came up, but it is nothing you peasants<br/>must concern yourselves with.')
('Lucio', "I'd appreciate if you kept your nose out of<br/>my business.")
('Graham', 'You sure get around, Van. Looking forward to seeing<br/>your drivers.')
('Graham', "We should start prepping, too! I bet this'll be a race<br/>for the ages!")
('Graham', 'Heya, guys. Stop by the bulletin board yet?')
('Van', 'Why? You post a request?')
('Graham', "Yeah. Gonna guess you haven't seen it, then.")
('Graham', "I know you're a busy man and all, but I'd appreciate it<br/>if you took a look at it if you got a sec.")
('Van', "Got'cha. I'll give it a look when I have the time.")
('Graham', "All right, everyone's cars passed inspection?")
('Graham', "Junifer'll be joining us right before we start.")
('Graham', "And she'll be coming with a total beast in tow, so<br/>look forward to that!")
(15102, 'Got it!')
('Graham', "Then let's get out there! And no accidents, you hear?")
('Graham', "The Revolution Festival's right around the corner, so<br/>we're brainstorming for an event to put up.")
('Graham', "We're always looking to improve our<br/>driving technique. Nothing wrong with having a little<br/>fun while we're at it.")
('Graham', "I know Junifer's real excited for it.")
('Graham', "I guess I'm starting to get pumped about it, too, haha.")
('Graham', "I'd kinda pegged the High Bloods as simple assholes,<br/>but they ended up surprising me.")
('Graham', "Infuriating as it was, races with 'em were always<br/>real blood-pumping.")
('Graham', "I'd welcome them back to challenge us again in<br/>Edith anytime.")
('Graham', 'Some folks have been coming around lately trying to<br/>stir up shit with our crew.')
('Graham', "I mean, yeah, we're a little rowdy and stuff, but we try<br/>to never get people involved.")
('Graham', "Man, oh, man. I just hope things don't get any worse.")
('Graham', 'I keep trying to keep the crew out of danger, but<br/>some of them are permanently on a short fuse.')
('Graham', "I worry about them as team lead, of course. I try to<br/>tell them to keep their cool, but it doesn't<br/>always work.")
('Graham', "Downey and the others are busy for the day, trying to<br/>get their hands on a new car, so they won't be joining<br/>us today.")
('Graham', "Here's hoping they don't get carried away and end up<br/>in a big mess...")
('Graham', "I'm sure it'll be fine, though. I remember just how<br/>pumped I was when I got approved for a loan to buy<br/>this puppy.")
('Graham', 'My literal ride-or-die to this day. I hope Downey can<br/>find himself something just as special today.')
('Graham', 'Lotta no-shows today. Oh, well. More road for us!')
('Graham', "Tonight's a real beauty, but keep your eyes on the<br/>road, everyone!")
('Van', 'Hey, Graham. On your way out?')
('Graham', 'Hey, Van. And yeah. I called to get our<br/>crew together.')
('Graham', "We don't usually ride while it's still bright outside,<br/>but Junifer really wanted to go.")
('Graham', "But don't worry! We'll keep an eye on her. Won't let<br/>her get into a wreck or nothing.")
('Van', "Not worried at all. I know y'all aren't the type to<br/>drive recklessly.")
('Van', "Just be sure not to make a scene and end up gettin'<br/>caught, 'kay?")
('Graham', 'Thanks for worrying, man. You should join<br/>us sometime!')
('Graham', 'All right, Downey and Hyades are here.<br/>Everyone else should be along shortly.')
('Graham', "I'd say it's time we get on the road then! Pedals to the<br/>floor everyone!")
('Downey', "I'm taking my new ride to the limit! Let me show ya<br/>what this baby can do, Graham!")
('Graham', "It's a nice ride, Downey, but be careful when<br/>it's raining.")
('Graham', 'Better to have a good time on the road than<br/>hydroplane off it, yeah?')
('Graham', "Used to think you guys were all just reckless drivers.<br/>Definitely too dangerous for Edith's streets.")
('Graham', "But today's race was one to remember. Come back<br/>soon, High Bloods!")
('Lucio', 'Hmph. I see no reason why I should take orders from<br/>a commoner like yourself.')
('Lucio', 'But I suppose it is the philanthropic burden of<br/>nobility to give unto the have-nots... Let us meet on<br/>the road again.')
('Downey', "Hell yeah! I'm feeling like a million mira!")
('Downey', "We're going full throttle today!")
('Downey', 'My baby came back to me! My sweet, sweet baby!')
('Downey', "You're a sight for sore eyes! I'll give you a big smooch<br/>and never let you go!")
('Downey', "I can't just sit on the sidelines after seeing a wild race<br/>like that!")
('Downey', 'Damn it! Gotta get my sweet ride back in business so<br/>we can get back on the road!')
('Downey', "I made up my mind, Hyades: I'm buying a new ride!")
('Downey', "Man, I can't take it anymore! I got super pumped<br/>after that last race. I need some time on the road, too!")
('Downey', "Came by to see Graham and the gang! I'm<br/>so pumped!")
('Downey', "Graham's car is so sick, dude!")
('Downey', 'Man, I envy Junifer! No fair that she got her uncle to<br/>help pimp her car up!')
('Hyades', "Junifer's one of the best drivers on the team. She's the<br/>real deal!")
('Hyades', "Wonder just how fast she'll fly once her car's in<br/>top shape.")
('Hyades', "I know I'm looking forward to seeing it!")
('Hyades', "I got my baby back! Ohh, leave it to Bradley to work<br/>his magic! It's like she never left my side!")
('Hyades', "It's also like the dirt never left my side. Geez, he<br/>could've at least cleaned her up a bit! She's FILTHY.")
('Hyades', "...Man, that made me sound like a total jerk.<br/>I'LL give my baby a good wash!")
('Hyades', 'Downey weirds me out a bit. Dunno why.')
('Hyades', "I don't wanna hang out with him...")
('Hyades', 'I was at the edge of my seat that whole race. I get<br/>how you feel now, Downey.')
('Hyades', "I need to catch up! I'll be pulling off tricks like that<br/>one day—I just gotta keep practicing!")
('Hyades', "Nothing beats having your own sweet ride!<br/>...Even if the ride isn't so sweet.")
('Hyades', "Or my driving skills, for that matter. I haven't scored<br/>a single win...")
('Hyades', "Nope! Nope! I'm letting the negativity get to me!<br/>That's lame, man! All I gotta do is get back behind<br/>the wheel and practice today.")
('Hyades', "Dang, that's a sick ride!")
('Hyades', 'Not lending you another single mira, though!<br/>Gotta save to get myself my own ride!')
('Hyades', "Oh, hey! Junifer's here, too!")
('Hyades', "Tonight's a night to burn up the road, hell yeah!<br/>Er, not that I have a car, but... Yeah!")
('Lucio', "Roger and Tebo were roaming from stall to stall in<br/>a stupor. I suppose they must've gotten<br/>themselves lost.")
('Lucio', "What boorish behavior. We're High Bloods.<br/>Have they no shame?!")
('Lucio', "I suppose I'd better enlist the help of the nearby<br/>constabulary to look for them.")
('Damian', "That's that, then? Life sure comes at you fast.")
('Damian', "I'm not sure why they broke the group up. We still<br/>have driving left to do!")
('Damian', 'Maybe I should call up Roger and Tebo to get the<br/>High Bloods back on the road!')
('Damian', 'Oh, right! I almost forgot the Revolution Festival<br/>was today.')
('Damian', 'I might just celebrate by getting a nice and loud new<br/>muffler installed!')
('Van', "You do you, bud. But don't go whining if you end up<br/>losin' with that noisy piece of junk on ya.")
('Damian', "C-C'mon! It was just, umm, a joke!")
('Damian', "'Boutta go out on all the wild customizations I can<br/>fit in!")
('Damian', 'All these tools feel so cheap! The ones in our garage<br/>are way better!')
('Damian', "Though I guess they're pretty easy to handle.")
('Damian', 'Oh, hey! This would totally work for doing<br/>maintenance on my bike!')
('Seyla', 'I was administering first aid to someone who was<br/>attacked by those monsters.')
('Seyla', 'The concert had gone off without a hitch, too...')
('Seyla', "It's all like some waking nightmare... But I'll do what<br/>I can to help everyone.")
('Seyla', "Don't worry about us. Lulua's great at keeping her<br/>head cool, and Natalie's real dependable.")
('Seyla', "Lulua's surprisingly good at keeping her head cool<br/>under pressure. Just having her around is comforting.")
('Seyla', "Not to mention—huh? Where'd those kids get off to?")
('Seyla', "Maybe they're in the bathroom? We gotta keep our<br/>eyes on them...")
('Seyla', 'I heard you got those kids back to their parents safely.')
('Seyla', "Thank you. It's a huge weight off my shoulders<br/>knowing they're home safe now.")
('Seyla', "That's it, yes! Keep that rhythm! Mind<br/>your breathing!")
('Seyla', "I asked Jess to brush up on the song, so now all that's<br/>left is to practice.")
('Seyla', "It'd probably calm my nerves a little if we could do a<br/>full run of the show with an audience. Not sure how<br/>we'd swing that, though...")
('Seyla', "(Heehee. I gotta admit, I'm happy with<br/>our performance.)")
('Seyla', '(Lulua can still improve with her singing and<br/>dancing, but her energy on our last show<br/>was unmatched.)')
('Seyla', "(I'm ready to go full steam ahead! Things can<br/>definitely work out with her!)")
('Seyla', "(Me and Lulua pairing up wasn't something that<br/>happened out of nowhere.)")
('Seyla', '(If everything goes well, then this might be one heck<br/>of a performance to make my swan song. I hope it<br/>can open some doors for her, though.)')
('Seyla', "(It's not like I wanna leave her alone in this dead-end<br/>idol industry...)")
('Seyla', "I've been practicing with her for two weeks now, and<br/>I'm not so sure Lulua's cut out to be an idol.")
('Seyla', "Not for lack of talent, don't get me wrong. It's more<br/>of a genre issue.")
('Seyla', 'Here in the Republic, people listen to either classical<br/>or jazz. Chanson singers are pretty popular, too.')
('Seyla', "Idol pop doesn't even cut it as an afterthought.<br/>It's worse than that. And it's a real shame.")
('Seyla', "I've been throwing everything into making it as an<br/>idol, but maybe it's time I face reality.")
('Seyla', "My partner Natalie decided to become a chanson<br/>singer because she couldn't imagine any success<br/>coming from being an idol.")
('Seyla', "That's why Cupid broke up. Maybe it's about time I<br/>throw in the towel...")
('Seyla', "I don't even know what I'm doing anymore, to<br/>be honest.")
('Seyla', "I've known for a while it's time to call it a day and<br/>walk away from all of this. I didn't really see a reason<br/>to keep at it.")
('Seyla', "But then Lulua came along. She's got a great attitude,<br/>and massive potential.")
('Seyla', "*sigh* I really should tell her to reconsider, though.<br/>Me having my dreams crushed is bad enough.<br/>We don't need two depressed washouts.")
('Seyla', "Stand up! Back straight! You're singing out of tune,<br/>by the way! Stop that!")
('Seyla', "What a sorry excuse for an idol, Lulua!<br/>Gehenna'll freeze over before you get your debut at<br/>this rate!")
('Seyla', "I can't just be all depressed about it forever. I need to<br/>face reality sooner or later...")
('Seyla', "Maybe it's time to go job hunting. Find a normal job,<br/>work hard, and make a living that way.")
('Seyla', "This whole industry's just a popularity<br/>contest anyway. Why am I even surprised?")
('Seyla', 'Not a lot matters in this biz as much as<br/>public opinion. Without that, you might as well not<br/>even exist.')
('Seyla', "But that's what we wanted, right? We've come so far.")
('Seyla', 'Why give up now, Natalie?')
('Seyla', "*sigh* You didn't even stick around to see if we'd get<br/>into Summer Fest.")
('Seyla', "A show like that in front of Trion Tower would've<br/>been huge for us. You were so excited about it...")
('Seyla', 'Are we not good enough? Is that why you left?!')
('Agnès', "(Wow, she's beautiful. Is she involved with<br/>Summer Fest?)")
('Agnès', "(I probably shouldn't bother her...)")
('Seyla', "Great job during today's show! Got a couple of<br/>slipups here and there, but I thought it was otherwise<br/>spot on!")
('Seyla', 'The audience loved it! Just gotta perfect our act for<br/>the Revolution Festival, and then—')
('Lulua', "C'mon, Seyla! Don't be such a killjoy! Save the<br/>business talk for later. Right now, let's toast!")
('Lulua', "To the success of WithU's first show!")
('Seyla', "Y-You're right. Today calls for a celebration!")
('Lulua', 'Definitely! I know things are going to go great!<br/>Cheers to a great show together!')
('Lulua', "I've been thinking about it constantly for the past<br/>few days.")
('Seyla', 'We only got one thing left now...')
('Seyla', "And it's to tear it up even harder next time we take<br/>the stage!")
('Seyla', "Let's prove to the label that idols can be successful!")
('Seyla', "That way they won't even THINK about<br/>disbanding us!")
('Lulua', "We've got a new original song ready to rip.<br/>Let's make sure it's a smash hit!")
('Seyla', "Yeah, you said it.<br/>(Lulua's all wishful thinking. I wish it was that easy...)")
('Seyla', "(But either way, we're out of options. This is our last<br/>shot, so we've got to make it count.)")
('Seyla', "Let's practice for a bit more. Make sure<br/>everything's perfect. All we need is for fifty people to<br/>show up...")
('Lulua', "Ohh, okay! I'll talk to my neighbors again and see if<br/>they can come!")
('Lulua', "I made friends with my bus driver and manager at<br/>work, so I'll invite them, too!")
('Seyla', "Heehee, I'm counting on you! I'll handle the music<br/>side of things.")
('Seyla', 'I know a pretty popular singer, so I might be able to<br/>ask for help there.')
('Seyla', "(I got no choice. I'm running thin on options here.)")
('Lulua', "Umm, it's a surprise seeing you here, Natalie.")
('Seyla', 'Yeah, I thought you gave up on being an idol.<br/>What are you doing here?')
('Natalie', "*sigh* You haven't changed a bit, Seyla. Pretty as a<br/>rose, and about as thorny as one.")
('Natalie', "Think you'll ever bag a boyfriend with an attitude<br/>like that?")
('Seyla', "Just hurry up and tell us what you want! Unlike you,<br/>we don't have all that much time to waste.")
('Natalie', "All right, I'll cut you part-timers some slack, since the<br/>idol life is already hell enough. I'll be straight here.")
('Natalie', 'You need to become a singer, Seyla.')
('Natalie', 'Direct order from the higher ups. But you and I can<br/>go back to being a duo act.')
('Seyla', 'WHAT?!')
('Lulua', "Th-That's not possible! Seyla and I are already a<br/>duo—we're WithU!")
('Natalie', "And we're all real happy for you, new kid. Seyla, you<br/>get what this means, don't you?")
('Seyla', "(It was a little suspicious that they'd approve Lulua's<br/>debut just like that...)")
('Seyla', '(Did they have no faith in us from the start?!)')
('Seyla', 'Er, ahem... So, I got some news from the label.')
('Seyla', "It's official: you're a real idol now.")
('Lulua', 'GODDESS, YES!')
('Lulua', 'YES, YESSSSS! I DID IT, SEYLA!')
('Seyla', 'Stop. Zip it for a sec.')
('Lulua', "Y-Yes, ma'am!<br/>(You're real scary when you're angry!)")
('Seyla', "We'll be working together as a duo. Cupid is<br/>officially disbanding.")
('Lulua', 'I see... Your partner, Natalie, became a chanson<br/>singer, right? Is that why?')
('Seyla', "Yeah... She's a gifted singer. She's basically set up for<br/>success now that she's out of the idol business.")
('Seyla', "It's been tough... But you're here now.")
('Seyla', "Let's keep moving forward together as a new group—<br/>as WithU!")
('Lulua', "Definitely! I won't disappoint you!")
('Seyla', "All right, Lulua. Let's get started.")
('Lulua', "I'm so gonna hit the ground running! I'll give this<br/>massive opportunity my all and it's going to be perf—")
('Seyla', 'This is a part-time gig.')
('Lulua', 'P-Part-time?')
('Seyla', "You heard me. There's no way the label would put up<br/>the mira for full-time idols.")
('Seyla', "We pay for everything. That's costumes, venues,<br/>et cetera. Our only budget will come from our own<br/>blood, sweat, and tears.")
('Seyla', "And don't forget all the rehearsing in between those.<br/>Better kiss your free time and a good night's<br/>sleep goodbye!")
('Lulua', "Whaaat?! We're gonna get worked to the bone!")
('Lulua', "The big day's here! Aaah, I'm so dang nervous!")
('Lulua', "Let's get out there and give it our best, Seyla!")
('Seyla', "Someone's excited here. Maybe too much...")
('Lulua', "It's never enough! I mean, I'm about to take the stage<br/>with you, Seyla!")
('Lulua', "And I'm making my debut as an idol to boot! Ahh!<br/>This is a dream come true!")
('Seyla', "(This is a tiny gig, and she's just performing as a<br/>stand-in...but okay.)")
('Seyla', "Okay, yes, dream come true. How about we<br/>start rehearsal? The clock's ticking.")
('Lulua', "Wow, I can't believe I found you so quickly!<br/>Today must be my lucky day!")
('Lulua', "Umm, you're Seyla, right? The idol?")
('Seyla', 'You...know who I am?')
('Lulua', "Heehee, of course! I'm a huge Cupidhead!<br/>Your biggest fan!")
('Lulua', 'I first heard about you two years ago. I was so excited<br/>to see you live! You two were so cute on stage!')
('Seyla', 'Oh, umm, thanks?')
('Seyla', "I'm honestly surprised you even know what an idol is.<br/>Not many people around here do.")
('Lulua', "I guess it's still catching on here, haha. But I keep up<br/>with idols more than I do actresses!")
('Lulua', "That's why I moved to Edith from my<br/>hometown, actually. I want to be an idol, too!")
('Lulua', 'W-Would you take me under your wing, Seyla?!')
('Seyla', '...Wait, WHAT?!')
('Agnès', '(She sure is a go-getter...)')
('Agnès', "(But what's an 'idol'? I feel like I've heard the term<br/>somewhere before...)")
('Van', "(It's some kinda brand new pop some indie labels are<br/>pushing lately.)")
('Van', '(Figured it was something just for nerds and geeks,<br/>but I guess it can have all kinds of fans.)')
('Lulua', "I've decided to become an idol just like you<br/>and Natalie!")
('Seyla', 'Hold your horses there! This is so much to ask out<br/>of nowhere!')
('Seyla', '(Not to mention that Natalie already...)')
('Lulua', "I'll do anything! I swear, I'll do whatever it takes!")
('Lulua', "Okay, I'm coming up with a brand new dance!")
('Lulua', "I can't really use a mic, but that won't stop me from<br/>singing and dancing my heart out!")
('Lulua', "So cheer up, everyone! Let's put smiles on those faces!")
(15105, 'Haha, well said. No point in being all gloomy!')
(15107, "We're so lucky! We get to see Lulua dancing so close!")
('Lulua', "It's not like I'm not worried about what's happening,<br/>but I decided I would rather use that energy in<br/>helping out!")
('Lulua', "It's safe here, so I want to support everyone while we<br/>wait for help to arrive!")
('Lulua', "Don't strain yourself, okay? Take a breather if you<br/>need it!")
('Lulua', 'I can hear your voice crying for me! ♪')
('Lulua', "(Man, I'm starving! I could really go for some of<br/>Gordon's tacos right about now.)")
('Lulua', '(But no! Focus! This is our last shot at<br/>proving ourselves!)')
('Lulua', 'I never imagined being an idol would be so tough.')
('Lulua', "Pleeease, at least let me have a taco stipend or, like, a<br/>snack fund! C'mon, Seyla!")
('Lulua', "I can't believe I'm going to share the stage with<br/>THE Seyla!")
('Lulua', "Ahh! I'm the luckiest girl alive!")
('Lulua', "I'll give it my all! Trust me, this will be the show of<br/>a lifetime!")
('Lulua', "I'm hungry! Taco me, Gordon!")
('Lulua', "Tacos, tacos, and more tacos! My soul will leave my<br/>body if I don't get my daily dose of tacos!")
('Gordon', "Hahaha! I can see you've been workin' hard<br/>today, eh?")
('Gordon', "Ain't so sure what'cha up to, but it must be a<br/>tough gig, you rollin' in here so late all the<br/>time. Let me whip ya somethin' up real quick.")
('Lulua', "Yay! You're an angel, Gordon!")
('Gordon', 'Hahaha! Eat up and get that life back in you, lass!')
('Lulua', 'Can always count on you, Gordon!')
('Lulua', 'Do re mi fa so la ti do... ♪')
('Lulua', "(I'm really thankful Seyla's letting me rehearse<br/>with her...)")
('Lulua', "(But, umm, when can I move on from<br/>practicing scales? It feels like I've been doing this<br/>for forever...)")
('Lulua', "I'm finally in Edith! I haven't been here since dad<br/>brought me forever ago!")
('Lulua', "There's so many new buildings! But the tower still<br/>takes the cake!")
('Lulua', "Wait, what am I doing? I'm not here to sightsee!")
('Lulua', "I'm here on a mission! Let Operation S Hunter<br/>commence!")
('Natalie', '(What the hell is happening?! I just wanna curl up in<br/>a corner and cry...)')
('Natalie', "(But I can't with Seyla and that girl around...<br/>Gotta show 'em I'm made of tougher stuff!)")
('Natalie', '(Maybe moving around will help me get my mind off<br/>of things. Maybe help pass out food and drinks?<br/>...Yeah, that sounds good.)')
(15108, "This isn't good. I might not even be able to book you<br/>another show unless you get on stage with Seyla.")
(15108, 'You know what this means, right?')
('Natalie', 'I hear you. And I appreciate your candor as<br/>my producer. But...could I have just a little<br/>more time?')
('Natalie', "Seyla won't accept if I just spring it on her out<br/>of nowhere. Give me some time to ease her into<br/>the idea.")
(15108, "Sheesh, you're just as soft as she is. But fine.<br/>With how things are, maybe time is what she needs<br/>to gain some perspective.")
('Natalie', 'She will. Seyla and I have been talking, so all I gotta<br/>do is lay it out and—')
(15108, 'Whatever. Just take care of it.')
(15108, 'Just keep in mind we have our own bottom line to<br/>look out for. The most we can stall is two weeks.')
('Natalie', 'O-Okay! Thank you so much!')
('Natalie', 'I think Lulua and that old woman were talking about<br/>getting a snack down at the food stalls after leaving<br/>the concert hall.')
('Natalie', 'I think I heard something about trying out the tacos.')
('Natalie', 'Did she start working part time as a caregiver?')
('Natalie', "If she quit trying to be an idol, she wouldn't have to<br/>work so hard to make ends meet.")
('Natalie', "Guess Seyla and Lulua aren't giving up on making it<br/>as idols just yet.")
('Natalie', "Are they defying the label's direct order? This isn't<br/>like you, Seyla...")
('Natalie', "She's...changed. A lot, actually. I wonder if it's<br/>Lulua's doing.")
('Ticket Clerk', 'Yeah, I think someone like that was here.')
('Ticket Clerk', 'But I told them Jess was playing tonight, said the vibe<br/>was going to be chill.')
('Ticket Clerk', 'Got the feeling they were hoping for something a<br/>little heavier. They left without even buying a ticket.')
('Van', 'I see... You guys talk about anything else?<br/>Anything at all you can tell me will be a big help.')
('Ticket Clerk', "Uhh, let's see...")
('Ticket Clerk', 'Oh, right! I remember they were muttering as they<br/>walked out.')
('Ticket Clerk', "'Guess I'll head to the theater, then. I got a feeling<br/>they're playing something I'll like to see.'")
('Van', 'To the theater, then? Thanks a bunch, man.')
('Ticket Clerk', 'No worries. Please come by again!')
('Van', '(Only place you might catch a movie this late is<br/>Esprit Cinema in Tyrell.)')
('Van', '(Better get a move on before the trail goes cold.)')
('Ticket Clerk', "Hey, y'all! Glad to see you in one piece.")
('Ticket Clerk', "No clue what the heck's going on, but the coast looks<br/>safe for the time being.")
('Ticket Clerk', 'We set the place up as a makeshift shelter, so feel free<br/>to take a breather if you gotta.')
('Ticket Clerk', "We've got drinks and snacks aplenty, so everyone<br/>should be set. At least for a while.")
('Ticket Clerk', "You guys take care of yourselves out there! Don't do<br/>anything I wouldn't do!")
('Ticket Clerk', "Hey, man! Good to see you around. We've got an<br/>idol performance on for the Revolution Festival show.")
('Ticket Clerk', "They're a duo called WithU. This'll be their debut.")
('Ticket Clerk', "And to top it off, Jess wrote their songs!<br/>They're kinda nobodies right now, but I got a feeling<br/>they're on their way to being somebodies!")
('Ticket Clerk', 'Stop by and check the show out if you feel like it!')
('Ticket Clerk', "No one's seen or heard from Jess since he suddenly<br/>canceled his show the other day...")
('Ticket Clerk', "Guess he's just going through the patented Artist<br/>Drama Hour. I do hope he'll be back soon, though...")
('Ticket Clerk', "Today's Jess' big day! He'll be debuting his first major<br/>label single live today!")
('Ticket Clerk', "...If he makes it, that is. He's actually running late.")
('Ticket Clerk', "I got a bad feeling about this. We don't sell this much<br/>every day. And Jess isn't the type to no call, no<br/>show...right?")
('Ticket Clerk', "Hey, dude! We're putting on a free show tonight!")
('Ticket Clerk', "The opener is our own local up-and-comer, Jess.<br/>He's really been making a name for himself around<br/>here lately.")
('Ticket Clerk', "Word is he's about to sign with a major label.<br/>It's getting harder and harder to get tickets to see him<br/>before they sell out!")
('Ticket Clerk', "It's practically a miracle that he's playing a free show!<br/>This might be your one shot to see him live!")
('Ticket Clerk', "Hey, next act's still getting ready. You mind<br/>waiting outside?")
('Ticket Clerk', "I'll go do a sound check with 'em when I'm<br/>done here.")
('Ticket Clerk', "Hey, dude! We're putting on a free show tonight!")
('Ticket Clerk', "We've got an idol duo performing. Not exactly a<br/>venue seller right now, not gonna lie.")
('Ticket Clerk', "Rock bands are the wave right now. It's tough<br/>for idol bands to even make a breakthrough.")
('Ticket Clerk', 'Some music fans even say idol pop is just an excuse<br/>for artists in cute dresses to flirt with the audience.')
('Ticket Clerk', "But even then, those girls are working real hard.<br/>No reason they don't deserve our support!")
('Ticket Clerk', "Hey, dude! We're putting on a free show tonight!")
('Ticket Clerk', 'The popular singer-songwriter Jess is going to be<br/>treating us to some of his heart-wrenching tunes.')
('Ticket Clerk', "How about enjoying 'em with a drink?")
('Ticket Clerk', "Jess has really been making waves at the concert hall.<br/>He's even about to make his major label debut.")
('Ticket Clerk', "He'll be a big deal soon enough! Better see him<br/>before he gets his big break!")
('Ticket Clerk', 'All right. Time to get ready to open up.')
('Ticket Clerk', "We've got two acts on the bill tonight that I'm sure<br/>are gonna fire up the audience!")
('Ticket Clerk', 'That said, looks like things are fired up<br/>enough outside. Did something happen?')
('Vicar Mansur', 'Never could I have imagined that such devils would<br/>overrun this fair city...')
('Vicar Mansur', 'But the Winged Goddess will protect us. We shall<br/>persevere through this.')
('Vicar Mansur', "It's a great relief to see you unharmed, Feri. You must<br/>take the utmost caution out there!")
('Vicar Mansur', 'And please return to us safely.')
('Feri', "I promise I will! Take care of everyone here while I'm<br/>out, Father!")
('Vicar Mansur', 'If you intend to continue on, please be careful and<br/>come back to us safely.')
('Vicar Mansur', 'I must tend to and protect those who have sought<br/>shelter here.')
('Vicar Mansur', 'Please be careful, everyone. I would hate to see harm<br/>come to any of you.')

('Vicar Mansur', 'Peace be with you. May you be blessed by the<br/>Winged Goddess.')
('Vicar Mansur', "I've prescribed some medication to help soothe<br/>Lashkar's mind.")
('Vicar Mansur', "It's certainly not enough, that much I know. That boy<br/>is going through so much right now.")
('Vicar Mansur', 'We must hold steadfast for him, and support him<br/>through these trying times.')
('Vicar Mansur', 'The citizenry has started to regain a sense of<br/>normalcy, albeit small.')
('Vicar Mansur', 'It does bring me joy seeing people moving on slowly.<br/>We can never take back what has already been lost, so<br/>all we can do is move on.')
('Vicar Mansur', "Sorrow and grief still plague us all. I'll pray for the<br/>souls of those gone, and for those left behind to<br/>mourn them.")
('Vicar Mansur', "I've heard tell that the incident could've been<br/>racially motivated.")
('Vicar Mansur', "To think such hatred for one's neighbors brought this<br/>tragedy about...")
('Vicar Mansur', 'The wound left behind is deep, and maybe it shall<br/>never truly heal. We must unite in prayer, however,<br/>and support those affected the most.')
('Vicar Mansur', 'The sorrow and despair are too heavy for one to<br/>bear alone. We must unite in prayer to lift up those<br/>who need it most.')
('Vicar Mansur', 'Oh, Arusha, please shepherd the poor, innocent souls<br/>of those lost in Creil...')
('Vicar Mansur', 'May your radiance guide them to paradise and your<br/>wings envelop them in warmth everlasting.')
('Vicar Mansur', 'May you be a refuge for those who remain in this<br/>world, and protect them as they continue to walk<br/>through life.')
('Vicar Mansur', 'Everyone is beside themselves, grieving over the<br/>tragedy in Creil.')
('Vicar Mansur', 'Our temple is feeling the waves quite strongly, having<br/>a particularly strong connection with the village.')
('Vicar Mansur', 'We should all dedicate some time to pray for the<br/>eternal rest of those lost souls.')
('Vicar Mansur', 'Mother Kyra hails from an impoverished town in the<br/>Central East.')
('Vicar Mansur', "Life has guided her to the cloth, despite everything<br/>that's happened to her. I imagine heavenly hands<br/>ensured she'd never go astray.")
('Vicar Mansur', 'Perhaps that is why her dedication to the salvation of<br/>others is so unshakeable.')
('Vicar Mansur', 'I believe that she is of a divine fate. There are tasks<br/>only she is able to accomplish.')
('Vicar Mansur', "Calvard's Revolution Festival is fast approaching,<br/>now only a month away.")
('Vicar Mansur', "We'll need to start preparations on our end in<br/>concordance with Edith Grand Cathedral and the<br/>other chapels.")
('Vicar Mansur', "It's a very special day to all the citizens of our country.")
('Vicar Mansur', "The Central Eastern temples will be joining the<br/>prayer services offered. Feel free to participate, if<br/>you're so inclined.")
('Vicar Mansur', 'The abundance of resources in the Principality of<br/>Elsaim has made it the economic superpower<br/>governing the Central East.')
('Vicar Mansur', "The role it plays is pivotal, both with its status as a<br/>diplomatic powerhouse and its flourishing initiatives<br/>regarding the desert's forestation.")
('Vicar Mansur', 'Though we must not forget about Valis, it having<br/>become a wealthy city state through maritime trading.')
('Vicar Mansur', 'Rumors say that tensions have arisen between<br/>nations, mostly attributed to certain groups.')
('Vicar Mansur', 'Things are changing in the Central East. It would do<br/>us well to pay attention.')
('Vicar Mansur', 'The Principality of Elsaim is a wealthy nation, but<br/>Valis has made economic strides to rival it in<br/>recent years.')
('Vicar Mansur', "But they're not the only outliers. Some impoverished<br/>nations are moving along nicely, too. A major upset<br/>might envelop the region soon enough.")
('Vicar Mansur', 'As head of this temple, I must endeavor to keep<br/>abreast of developments between both countries.')
('Vicar Mansur', 'An unexpected guest graced us with a visit today.')
('Vicar Mansur', "Her name is Sister Belicia. She's from Creil Village in<br/>Vichy County.")
('Vicar Mansur', "She's very familiar with Mother Kyra, as she was her<br/>understudy for a time. I'm certain they must be eager<br/>to catch up with each other.")
('Vicar Mansur', "I'd rather she take the day off today, so that they may<br/>have ample time to speak with each other.")
('Vicar Mansur', "I'll handle any of her remaining tasks for the day, so<br/>that she may relax.")
('Vicar Mansur', 'I imagine the time to catch up with each other will be<br/>much needed and appreciated.')
('Vicar Mansur', 'I heard there will be a film festival underway in<br/>Tharbad next week.')
('Vicar Mansur', "Tharbad bordering with the Central East has deeply<br/>influenced its culture, even when it's still part of<br/>the Republic.")
('Vicar Mansur', "It may be in the middle of the desert, but luxurious<br/>hotels and other amenities are never lacking.<br/>It's developed widely in the past years.")
('Vicar Mansur', "I'm curious to see the continued impact the film<br/>industry has had in the Republic.")
('Vicar Mansur', "Tharbad borders with the Principality of Elsaim, the<br/>Central East's economic powerhouse.")
('Vicar Mansur', 'The Republic has maintained good relations with<br/>them for the longest time. The cultural exchanges<br/>seen in the film festival are fascinating.')
('Vicar Mansur', "I'm eager to see what this year brings.")
('Vicar Mansur', "It's a blessing to see the faces of our neighbors here at<br/>the temple.")
('Vicar Mansur', 'Despite Rooney not being from the Central East, he<br/>attends Sunday School with us regularly.')
('Vicar Mansur', 'It does my old heart good to see our youth getting<br/>along, despite the racial differences.')
('Vicar Mansur', "It's children like these that will carry our future. I look<br/>forward to seeing them fully grown.")
('Vicar Mansur', 'Our current society is regretfully plagued by racism.<br/>We live in an era where terrorism and<br/>anti-immigration sentiments are all too common.')
('Vicar Mansur', 'My hope is for children such as these to bring forth a<br/>brighter future, free of such hate.')
('Vicar Mansur', 'You can always count on Mother Kyra when you<br/>need to. Having her assistance has been quite<br/>the blessing.')
('Vicar Mansur', 'My work here is of great importance, though not so<br/>much that I must rush to tend to it.')
('Vicar Mansur', "Though I suppose now's as good a time as any to tend<br/>to the documents Mother Kyra prepared for me.")
('Vicar Mansur', "Oh, it's a pleasure seeing you today, Feri.<br/>What brings you by? I don't believe Sunday School's<br/>due today.")
('Vicar Mansur', 'Are these fine folks the ones taking care of you<br/>during your stay in Edith?')
('Feri', "Yup! They're taking me around 'cause I haven't had a<br/>chance to see the other districts!")
('Vicar Mansur', 'I see! That sounds like a delightful time.')
('Vicar Mansur', "I'm certain you'll come to find out how different<br/>things can be here from what you're used to<br/>back home.")
('Vicar Mansur', "If you have any questions, I'd be more than happy to<br/>sit down with you to address them.")
('Feri', "Thank you, Father! I'll definitely take you up on that!")
('Vicar Mansur', 'The Kruga hail from the foothills of the Ishgal<br/>Mountains, right, Feri?')
('Vicar Mansur', "I'm not particularly familiar with that region myself,<br/>but I can still guarantee that Edith will prove to be a<br/>whole new experience.")
('Vicar Mansur', "If you have any questions, I'd be more than happy to<br/>sit down with you to address them.")
('Vicar Mansur', 'Are you here for the worship service? All are welcome<br/>to join.')
('Vicar Mansur', "Our temple here is dedicated to the Winged Goddess<br/>Arusha. Though modeled after those in the Central<br/>East, our beliefs align with the West's chapels.")
('Agnès', 'The Winged Goddess worshiped in the Central East<br/>is the same as Aidios, then?')
('Vicar Mansur', "That's a wonderful question. People and cultures vary<br/>immensely from the East and West, and everything<br/>in between, but she's different in name only.")
('Vicar Mansur', "You can even find a Central Eastern temple right<br/>alongside the Holy City of Arteria's grand cathedral.")
('Agnès', "I'd heard something about this before, but not from<br/>an actual temple. It's very different hearing about it<br/>from the source.")
('Van', "Makes sense. Lotta people from the Central East call<br/>Calvard home. The Republic's a melting pot<br/>of cultures.")
('Van', 'This place is always full on days of worship.')
('Vicar Mansur', 'Haha, that it is. Exchange with the Central East has<br/>been on the rise in the past few years, after all.')
('Vicar Mansur', 'It might not be perfect yet. Cultural differences have,<br/>on occasion, led to tragedies.')
('Vicar Mansur', 'But we should still try and bridge the difference<br/>between us all. And, of course, you two are more than<br/>welcome to stop by anytime.')
('Agnès', "Thank you so much. We'll definitely stop by again!")
('Vicar Mansur', 'Central Easterners are definitely still a minority in<br/>the Republic.')
('Vicar Mansur', "But regardless of that, the Republic continues contact<br/>and exchange with the Central East. It's increased in<br/>the last few years, as a matter of fact.")
('Vicar Mansur', "We're at the cusp of something great, and cultural<br/>understanding between us all is nigh on paramount.")
('Vicar Mansur', "Please come pay us a visit whenever you'd like.<br/>We welcome you with open arms as friends<br/>and neighbors.")
('Priest Kyra', 'Lashkar finally fell asleep.')
('Priest Kyra', "It was really sudden. The exhaustion might've finally<br/>caught up to him.")
('Vicar Mansur', "Though small, I'm grateful he's able to find some<br/>respite in sleep.")
('Vicar Mansur', "I'll provide him with some medication to help soothe<br/>him once he wakes up.")
('Vicar Mansur', 'I just hope it can help, if even a little.')
('Priest Kyra', "Likewise. I'll be there for him however I can from<br/>here on.")
('Priest Kyra', "Things will eventually start looking up. At least he's<br/>not alone, and will still have Kaina with him.")
('Priest Kyra', "I've finished organizing the documents listing our<br/>parishioners and messages from the grand cathedral.")
('Priest Kyra', "All that's left is your seal and signature, Father!")
('Vicar Mansur', "You're early as ever, Mother Kyra! I...suppose I don't<br/>mind pausing my research for a moment.")
('Priest Kyra', 'Are you certain your research cannot wait?')
('Vicar Mansur', "Well, it's relatively urgent, I suppose. You should<br/>know, after all, since you originally—")
('Priest Kyra', "Y-Yes, Father, I get it. Please just sign those<br/>documents as soon as you're able!")
('Priest Kyra', "Especially those missives from the grand cathedral.<br/>They'll be expecting a reply sent back as soon<br/>as possible!")
('Priest Kyra', 'I must thank you for your assistance.')
('Priest Kyra', 'The neighborhood has thankfully been evacuated, but<br/>tensions still run high. Everyone fears these monsters<br/>may attack again.')
('Priest Kyra', "I'll be praying with everyone for a reprieve from<br/>this madness.")
('Priest Kyra', "I'll pray that fortune favors you as well! May the<br/>Winged Goddess guide your way.")
('Priest Kyra', 'Welcome to our temple! Blessed are we to share this<br/>day together.')
('Priest Kyra', "It's been a hard year, and not every bump in the road<br/>has come to a conclusion yet.")
('Priest Kyra', 'But I still wish for us to celebrate today.')
('Priest Kyra', "I'm certain Lashkar will be back to his old self soon!")
('Priest Kyra', "If you're looking for Lashkar, Kaina took him out to<br/>enjoy the festivities.")
('Priest Kyra', "He's been in shock for a while now. My hope is<br/>maybe the festival will be able to lift his spirits, if ever<br/>so slightly.")
('Priest Kyra', "Lashkar's asleep in the dormitory thanks to the<br/>medicine Father Mansur gave him.")
('Priest Kyra', "Don't worry about him. I'll be sure to look after him.")
('Priest Kyra', 'Both Kaina and the guild will be looking after him<br/>as well.')
('Priest Kyra', 'I truly believe that Lashkar will one day be able to<br/>move on from this tragedy.')
('Priest Kyra', "We're keeping Lashkar here at the temple for the<br/>time being.")
('Priest Kyra', "I worry most about his mental health, considering<br/>everything that's happened, but all we can do for now<br/>is look after him.")
('Priest Kyra', "I'm sure Sister Belicia would hate to see him this<br/>way, too... I'll do everything in my power to help him,<br/>in her memory.")
('Priest Kyra', 'Heehee, having a kid like Rooney around keeps<br/>things lively for all of us.')
('Priest Kyra', 'Speaking of lively, Lashkar came by again with a girl<br/>from the village workshop.')
('Priest Kyra', "They'll be staying at the Bracer Guild for the next<br/>couple of days, actually. You should pay them a visit.")
('Priest Kyra', "Well, then. I'd better start preparing for<br/>today's lesson...")
('Priest Kyra', "I'm so glad to see Sister Belicia is doing well!")
('Priest Kyra', "Even though we're both of Central Eastern heritage,<br/>we were raised in different countries and cultures.")
('Priest Kyra', 'That, thankfully, has never come between us. I feel<br/>like we truly understand each other.')
('Priest Kyra', 'I wish her the best in tending to her duties in Creil!')
('Priest Kyra', 'Belicia really loves her hometown. She felt called to<br/>serve in Creil despite being approached by many<br/>other temples.')
('Priest Kyra', "Maybe it would have been too much to ask for her to<br/>leave all she's ever known to attend to a temple in the<br/>Central East.")
('Priest Kyra', "I'm just thankful that the Sunday School children and<br/>Belicia's brother are happy and healthy.")
('Priest Kyra', 'Oh, what am I saying? Of course they should be!<br/>Children being happy and healthy is the<br/>bare minimum!')
('Priest Kyra', "Even if I can't directly impact their health<br/>and happiness...")
('Priest Kyra', "...I can still hope they'll be able to lead great lives of<br/>their own!")
('Priest Kyra', "I've been friends with Sister Belicia for a while now,<br/>but I hadn't had the pleasure of meeting her brother.<br/>He just stopped by to introduce himself.")
('Priest Kyra', 'He was such an energetic boy! And the girl he was<br/>with was so adorable.')
('Priest Kyra', "Heehee, maybe I shouldn't say this out loud, but I'm<br/>totally rooting for them and that cute and innocent<br/>relationship they have!")
('Priest Kyra', "Since they'll be sticking around Riverside to sightsee,<br/>I'll be a good sister and keep an eye on them. From a<br/>distance, of course!")
('Priest Kyra', 'Though seeing them both sure has made me miss<br/>Belicia even more.')
('Priest Kyra', "Father Mansur is such a wonderful man. He's taught<br/>me so much.")
('Priest Kyra', "Whenever I assist him with his tasks, though, I can't<br/>tell if he's being overly discreet or just careless.")
('Priest Kyra', "Or maybe he's just overwhelmed from doing<br/>too much!")
('Priest Kyra', "Hello, Feri! It's nice to see you, but Sunday School's<br/>not in session today.")
('Priest Kyra', 'Is something the matter? Are you in some sort<br/>of trouble?')
('Feri', "Nope! I'm on the job today! They're showing me<br/>around today, so I thought I'd pop in and say hello!")
('Van', "Was a mighty shame that she'd only seen Riverside,<br/>so we're takin' her on a tour 'round Edith.")
('Priest Kyra', 'My! I half expected dear Feri here to already have run<br/>a few laps around Edith!')
('Priest Kyra', "But I hope you enjoy your tour of the capital, dear.<br/>It's a wonderful place, so you should take in<br/>the sights.")
('Feri', "I will! Everything is so cool! I don't wanna miss out<br/>on anything!")
('Priest Kyra', 'By the way, Feri, I hear you met a Central Eastern<br/>sister of the cloth in Creil Village.')
('Priest Kyra', "If it is who I think it is, you might've just met one of<br/>my friends! She'd mentioned wanting to work at the<br/>chapel in her hometown.")
('Priest Kyra', "I hear she's doing well for herself of late. Oh, how I<br/>hope we can meet sometime soon.")
('Priest Kyra', 'We have a lot of catching up to do after all<br/>these years!')
('Priest Kyra', "Our newest kid's been fitting in just fine. That's such<br/>a relief... I suppose now I can focus on my<br/>other duties.")
('Priest Kyra', "Even though Father Mansur looks so well put, he's<br/>more forgetful than he seems. I have to stay on top of<br/>things like announcements and such.")
('Priest Kyra', "We haven't seen each other in a while, but I'm sure<br/>she must be holding up well in the countryside.")
('Priest Kyra', "I believe she said she'd ended up in a chapel in her<br/>home village, no less.")
('Priest Kyra', 'She did that, even despite her Central<br/>Eastern heritage.')
('Priest Kyra', "It really shows her dedication to her hometown, that<br/>she'd be willing to work in a western chapel.")
('Priest Kyra', "Can't guarantee she feels about it the same as I do, to<br/>be fair, but it doesn't matter. As long as she's happy,<br/>I'm happy.")
('Priest Kyra', "Heehee, I'm pleased to see Lolo's fitting right in<br/>with everyone.")
('Priest Kyra', 'These three are about to become a real handful!<br/>But lively children are nothing to balk at.')
('Lashkar', 'Oww... Ugh, it hurts... Oww!')
('Lashkar', 'But... But I bet it hurt even more...when Annie and<br/>the others...')
('Agnès', 'Wh-What happened?')
('Lashkar', "Oh, it's you guys... Don't worry about it. Damn it...")
('Feri', "But you're hurt.")
('Priest Kyra', "He is. After what happened...then hearing about<br/>the events in Oración, Lashkar hasn't...been<br/>himself lately.")
('Priest Kyra', 'I believe he picked a fight with some miscreants in<br/>town today.')
('Aaron', "A kid like him shouldn't write checks his skinny<br/>wrists can't cash.")
('Van', "You ain't exactly picky with targets when you just<br/>gotta lash out. Anyone will do, especially when<br/>Almata's outta the picture now.")
('Van', "Probably bit off more than he could chew with some<br/>punk that looked like he'd fit right in with Almata.")
('Lashkar', "Yeah, so what?! What do you care, anyway?!<br/>Everyone's gone already! Even the bad guys, and I<br/>couldn't do anything!")
('Lashkar', "Here I was, thinking I could become a bracer...<br/>Hah, turns out I'm just useless! Worthless, damn it!")
('Agnès', "(So that's what this is all about...)")
('Feri', "(I don't think this is something he can punch his way<br/>out of, but is there anything else he can really do?)")
('Van', "(If there is, we ain't gonna be the ones findin' the<br/>answer to that for him. Best we leave him be.)")
('Lashkar', "This can't be happening... The village... Everyone...<br/>Belicia, Annie. All of them...gone.")
('Agnès', "L-Lashkar?! Oh, thank goodness you're all right!")
('Van', 'You been here all along? Guess you dodged a pretty<br/>hefty bullet there...')
('Agnès', "That's right, I remember seeing him in Creil Village!")
('Van', 'Anyone else make it out?')
('Priest Kyra', "Oh, it's you guys. Yes. Lashkar and Kaina both were in<br/>Edith at the time.")
('Priest Kyra', "But Belicia and everyone else... We don't know if they<br/>made it. *sniffle*")
('Priest Kyra', 'Ah, my apologies. I must keep it together. I need to<br/>be there for Lashkar. I owe that much to everyone that<br/>was lost...')
('Judith', "(Almata's gone too far...)")
('Van', "We'll do somethin' about all this.")
('Van', 'You and Father Mansur take care of him in<br/>the meantime.')
('Van', 'If you need anything, feel free to get in touch. And I<br/>really do mean anything.')
('Priest Kyra', "Thank you, Van. I'll keep that in mind. For now...all<br/>I can do is pray the souls lost in Creil can find peace.<br/>And look after Lashkar, of course.")
('Priest Kyra', 'May Arusha light your path.')
('Priest Kyra', "Belicia, it's been forever! We haven't had a chance to<br/>sit down and talk since we were still studying<br/>in Arteria.")
('Priest Kyra', "Your brother mentioned that you've been doing<br/>wonderfully in Creil.")
('Sister Belicia', 'Heehee, of course I would be! I grew up there,<br/>after all.')
('Sister Belicia', "I do wish I could use more of your teachings<br/>there, though. It's so different from a Central<br/>Eastern temple.")
('Sister Belicia', "I know that what I'm serving is a Western chapel, but<br/>learning more about my heritage has really expanded<br/>my worldview. Wish I could share it!")
('Priest Kyra', "Sounds like this has been on your mind for a<br/>while now. But even if it's bothering you, I'm glad<br/>everything else is going great!")
('Priest Kyra', 'I heard Creil makes a point to markedly differentiate<br/>between the practices of East and West, so I was a<br/>bit worried!')
('Shino', "I'll wake her shortly and call a cab for her if she<br/>needs one.")
('Shino', 'Good night, Van. And do remember to take it easy<br/>once in a while.')
('Van', 'Will do... Thanks, Shino.')
('Shino', "I've set up shop in every district before, but I always<br/>come back to good old Riverside.")
('Shino', 'Where dreams come true and friendly faces are<br/>aplenty. Plus, this is where all my regulars are.')
('Shino', "Riverside's where I set up shop for the first time, so<br/>it holds a special place in my heart.")
('Shino', 'I make sure to stop by at least once a month, and<br/>every time still feels just as fresh.')
('Shino', "Bermotti's always looking for ways to improve his craft.<br/>Maybe I should ask if I could study under him again...")
('Shino', "This light drizzle's really brought a chill out.<br/>I'm serving up warm cocktails to fight it off.")
('Shino', "Out for an evening stroll? Careful you don't catch<br/>a cold.")
('Van', "Heh, I'll try. Thanks, Shino.")
('Van', "Just got a few things to take care of before<br/>headin' back.")
('Shino', "Thanks again for your help. It's a relief knowing my<br/>customers are safe and sound.")
('Shino', "I'll have to make sure he's well taken care of next time<br/>I see him around.")
('Shino', 'You look like you could use a drink yourself, Van.<br/>How about a cocktail before heading home?')
('Shino', "It's concerning that one of my customers would leave<br/>something like that behind...")
('Shino', "I'll leave it to you to get it back to them.")
('Shino', "I've got your favorite flavor of gelato today, Van.")
('Shino', 'Would you like some to go?')
('Van', 'You know me too well.')
('Agnès', "Don't forget to stop by the orbal café in front of the<br/>station on our way back.")
('Shino', 'Well, look who it is.')
('Van', 'Been a while, Shino. You open yet?')
('Shino', "Still setting up, I'm afraid.")
('Shino', "I'll be done by evening, if you want to stop by then.<br/>Your favorite sweets will be on the menu.")
('Van', 'A woman after my own heart! You know me so well.')
('Agnès', "I don't think I've ever seen a mobile food stand like<br/>this before.")
('Van', "It's pretty unique, to be fair. Welcome to Shino's<br/>roamin' bar.")
('Van', 'Goes wherever the clients are at.')
('Van', 'Cocktails and snacks are out of this world. I stop by<br/>whenever I can find her.')
('Shino', 'And your business is always appreciated. ♪')
('Shino', "Not every drink on the menu's alcoholic, so I can<br/>whip you something up later if you're up for it.")
('Agnès', "Definitely! With Van talking you up so much, I'd<br/>love to try something out.")
('Shino', "I should be open later this evening, Van. By the way,<br/>I'll have a few of your favorite sweets on the menu.")
('Shino', 'Do stop by if you get the chance.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Zzz... Dingo...')

('Van', "(At least she's got what it takes to make it as far as<br/>the afterparty.)")
('Van', 'Sorry for the hassle, Shino. Want me to look<br/>after her?')
('Shino', "Don't worry about it. Let her sleep. Marielle's put in<br/>a lot of work today—I'd say she's earned it.")
('Shino', "I heard you two found Dingo's notebook.")
('Van', "Sure did. Couldn't have done it if Dingo hadn't laid it<br/>out for us so well, though.")
('Van', 'Did everything in style, right till the end.')
('Shino', 'Sounds like Dingo, all right.')
('Shino', "Care for a drink? Here's a sidecar—a little on the<br/>sweet side.")
('Shino', 'On the house, of course. Consider it my<br/>congratulations for a job well done.')
('Van', "Haha... Dingo's favorite drink, yeah?")
('Van', 'Much appreciated. Cheers to the pretty boy.')
('Sister Belicia', "I loved getting to talk to Mother Kyra after all<br/>this time. Busy as always, but she hasn't changed<br/>a bit.")
('Sister Belicia', 'She told me Lashkar stopped by the other day and<br/>updated her on how I was doing.')

('Marduk Security Guard', "Plenty of people are still holed up in their homes.<br/>We gotta make sure they're safe, too.")

('Feri', "Ohh! You're right! We should give them a ride!")
('Aaron', "Sounds more like a pain than anything, but it's better<br/>than you biking straight into a monster's mouth.<br/>Let's get this over with!")

('Giordano', "Got a sweet ride, white as snow. Quick, courteous,<br/>an' will do anything for the right price.")

('Giordano', "Sounds like I got m'self a new rival, eh? 'S good to<br/>have something to look forward to.")
('Giordano', "Seems like that back alley courier an' I are<br/>kindred souls.")

('Nadiya', "The high tensions between us and the Empire made<br/>it so we couldn't visit Culleo after he went there.")
('Nadiya', "I guess that's just part of the job when you're<br/>a diplomat. Culleo's always been very passionate<br/>about other countries.")
('Nadiya', "Only natural he'd want to share that passion with us.<br/>I really hope some of his worldliness will rub off on<br/>our daughter.")

('Nadiya', 'I just never had the chance to visit because of<br/>the tumult.')
('Secretary Culleo', "Haha, you're just as focused on art as always,<br/>Nadiya. I can't say I've seen much when it comes to<br/>dolls lately...")
('Secretary Culleo', '...but Arc en Ciel is much more interesting than<br/>the movies. I bet even Amia will have a blast.')
('Amia', 'Oh, I heard about Arc en Ciel in Sunday School!')
('Amia', "They say the action scenes and the dancing are<br/>sooo cool! And they don't even use special effects like<br/>in the movies!")
('Secretary Culleo', "Oh, you want to see them, too, Amia? You've grown<br/>so much!")
('Secretary Culleo', "Here I thought you'd only want to go to Mishelam<br/>Wonderland because of Mishy in Boots.")
('Amia', 'Er, well... About Mishy, umm...')
('Nadiya', 'Culleo, that movie, umm... How can I put this?')

('Renne', "Heehee. There's no need to worry about me. I'll be<br/>heading home shortly.")

('Renne', 'Look at you, working so hard at your part-time<br/>job today. Ever the overachiever.')
('Sasha', "Renne filled me in a little on what you do.<br/>It's certainly...interesting.")
('Sasha', "Especially that stud you're working with. I didn't take<br/>you for one to be into older men! Oh, the Student<br/>Council's gonna have a field day with this!")
('Agnès', 'Y-You got the wrong idea here!')
('Renne', "I imagine they'll love hearing about that little incident<br/>from the other day.")

('Sasha', "Personally, I'd like to do something about James.")
('Renne', "Ah, yes. James. He's been grumbling nonstop ever<br/>since that happened.")

('Bracer Alvis', 'Sure takes me back to doing the same when we were<br/>still junior bracers.')
('Bracer Regina', "Yeah. It's a hard task, getting a recommendation<br/>letter from every branch, but it's good work before<br/>becoming a senior bracer.")
('Bracer Regina', "Not just that, but it's the best way for all bracers to<br/>acquire their most useful tool on the job.")
('Bracer Gray', 'What tool?')
('Bracer Alvis', "Spoiler alert, but it's cultural understanding.")
('Bracer Alvis', "The Republic's full of folks from all cultures<br/>and backgrounds. You won't be a good bracer if you<br/>don't learn how to approach them all.")

('Bracer Regina', "Give it your best out there! It's a tough road ahead,<br/>but I know you can pull it off.")
('Bracer Alvis', "Best of luck out there, man. Can't look after you since<br/>we're going in opposite directions, but I have a feeling<br/>I won't need to. You got this.")
('Bracer Gray', 'Thanks, to the both of you! Safe travels, and I hope<br/>you enjoy your drinks!')
('Bracer Alvis', "Speaking of, I still can't believe you're not even<br/>slightly drunk, Regina.")
('Bracer Regina', "Is it really that weird? I've only had a few drinks<br/>so far. I don't throw them back as recklessly as<br/>you do.")
('Bracer Regina', "Talk about lack of restraint. It's not long before you're<br/>a blubbering, drunken mess.")
('Bracer Regina', 'I still remember when we got promoted to<br/>senior bracers. You got so drunk that you told Elaine<br/>that—')
('Bracer Alvis', "H-Hey! No need to bring that back up, yeah?<br/>(You don't have to throw that back in my face...)")
('Bracer Lahad', "Huh? Li'l miss, are you...?")
('Feri', "Me? I'm Ferida!")
('Bracer Lahad', 'I had no idea you had a Kruga on your<br/>payroll, spriggan. Pulling out the big guns, huh?')
('Bracer Lahad', "I heard about that case you solved the other day.<br/>You might just regret it if you keep kicking the<br/>hornet's nest.")
('Van', "Yeah, yeah. I got'cha.<br/>(Not like I'm TRYIN' to get us in trouble.)")
('Agnès', "(You might've missed the mark a little there.)")
('Agnès', "(Still, I'm impressed how far and wide the Kruga<br/>are known.)")
('Van', "(Don't think anyone from the Central East could<br/>possibly not know about 'em. Especially a bracer<br/>worth his salt.)")
('Feri', '(I get the feeling that this guy really knows his stuff!<br/>He might even know Abi and everyone else!)')
('Bracer Lahad', "Listen, I'm not trying to rain on your parade<br/>or anything. Just...be careful. Not everyone'll be too<br/>fond of what you get up to.")
('Bracer Lahad', "Heh! Careful you don't go worrying Elaine!")
('Bracer Lahad', "All right! It's about time you get started on your way<br/>to becoming a senior bracer.")
('Bracer Gray', "*gulp* Y-Yes, sir! I'm ready!")
('Bracer Lahad', "But before I send you off from branch to branch, I<br/>wanna ask you one thing, Gray. What're you<br/>striving for?")
('Bracer Gray', 'Striving for...? I... I guess I want to be someone<br/>capable of helping those in need.')
('Bracer Lahad', "Not a bad answer, but it's a little bland, don't<br/>ya think?")
('Bracer Lahad', "Listen, Gray. Keep a hold of your ideals. Don't lose<br/>sight of them. Draw strength from them and the path<br/>forward will always be clear.")
('Bracer Lahad', "You can't help anyone when you're lost yourself.<br/>You've got a good heart, but you better not<br/>forget that.")
('Bracer Gray', 'Y-Yes, sir!<br/>(Draw strength from my ideals...)')
('Bracer Gray', 'Haha, you all seem like such good friends!')
('Bracer Gray', "I'm a little anxious, but I know they have big<br/>expectations for me. I'm going to do my best out<br/>there so that they can be proud of me!")
('Bracer Gray', "I'm planning on taking on a solo request today.<br/>Haha... I'm honestly a little nervous.")
('Bracer Gray', "You're that spriggan, right? I heard about what you<br/>got up to in Langport.")
('Bracer Gray', "I heard you didn't exactly solve that case by the book.<br/>Maybe it's not my place to say anything, but—")
('Agnès', "We all draw the line somewhere. And we didn't<br/>commit any crimes while doing it.")
('Feri', "Yeah, we worked with Heiyue and all, but I don't<br/>think that's a big deal.")
('Aaron', 'Did we ruffle some feathers there? Are you actually<br/>bothered about the legality of it all, or about<br/>getting upstaged?')
('Bracer Gray', "Er, no, I didn't mean it that way. What I wanted to<br/>say was...keep up the good work!")
('Van', 'What?')
('Bracer Gray', "We can all do with different perspectives. Our way of<br/>seeing things can't be the only justice that exists.")
('Bracer Gray', "I'm just happy that there are people out there willing<br/>to do what needs to be done!")
('Van', '(Bright-eyed rookie stereotype at its finest.)')
('Agnès', '(Ahaha... He sure does come on a bit strong. But it<br/>goes to show that not all bracers are the same.)')
('Feri', "(Yeah, he's really laying it on thick! Guess there are<br/>all types of bracers, huh?)")
('Aaron', "(He's got eyes full of stars, and they're looking<br/>straight at you. Dude's kind of a suck-up.)")
('Bracer Gray', "I'm doing my best every day to stand on my own as a<br/>proper bracer.")
('Bracer Gray', 'But I take heart knowing there are people out there<br/>like you doing what needs to be done to ensure justice<br/>is served!')
('Bracer Gray', "Let's work together to make the world a better place!")

('Bracer Gray', "Yes, sir! I'll work my hardest today with you, sir!")
('Aaron', 'Ahh... Nothing beats kicking back and binging with<br/>the boys. But the thought of work is killing my buzz...')
('Aaron', 'Well, at the very least, doing the rounds lets me suss<br/>out a new watering hole or two.')
('Aaron', 'So I guess, just lemme know when you need me to do<br/>my sweep.')
('Walter the Direwolf', 'All right, time to kick back and get some<br/>proper R&R.')

('Dingo', "Today's the first I've heard about it. Isn't that<br/>a funny coincidence.")
('Van', 'Funny? Why?')
('Van', "Langport's economy is boomin' these days. Pretty on<br/>par with Edith's, even. It makes sense there'd be<br/>interest in it.")

('Kukai', "And here's your payment.")
('System', 'Received Onyx Steel!')
('Van', 'Is this some kinda metal?')
('Kukai', "Yup. I came across it in one of my fishing trips.<br/>It's called Onyx Steel.")
('Kukai', 'We also call it Star Steel in the East. Very rare and<br/>precious metal you got there.')
('Kukai', 'Legends say a weapon crafted with it can cut down a<br/>thousand enemies without showing any wear.')
('Van', 'Mighty impressive.')
('Kukai', "But you need to be careful with it.<br/>Your run-of-the-mill smith won't be able to draw out<br/>its true power.")
('Kukai', 'You need proper technique to mold it.')

('Kukai', "You're most welcome, lad.")
('Van', "I'll need to find a specialist to handle this baby.")
('Van', "Maybe I should see what ol' Giscard can do with it.")
('Quatre', "Good idea. I'm sure the supervisor will know what<br/>to do.")

('Quatre', "I don't doubt it.")
('Quatre', 'And speaking of, I believe the supervisor is at the<br/>grand cathedral in Auber.')
('Van', 'That works.')
('Van', "Bet somethin' like this'll be a cakewalk for Basel's<br/>chief engineer.")
('Van', 'I should bring it up to Quatre, see what he thinks.')
('Kukai', "They really do just keep pumping out these orbal<br/>movies, huh. But I guess that's to be expected.")

('Bermotti', "Well, isn't she a polite one! What a lovely client you<br/>have today.")
('Bermotti', 'So I assume whatever led you here regards Giacomo?')
('Agnès', "...That's right.")

('Bermotti', 'Of course it would. The scene of the crime was<br/>practically in my front yard.')
('Bermotti', 'I found him difficult to like as someone in the<br/>same trade...')

('Agnès', 'What do you mean?')
('Van', 'So he did put his hand in the fire.')
('Van', "Guessin' it was last night?")
('Bermotti', "Well guessed. You're absolutely right.")
('Bermotti', 'One of my sources tells me he tipped off the police.')
('Bermotti', 'He said a criminal gang was in the midst of a massive<br/>drug deal.')
('Agnès', "Th-That's no good...")
('Van', "It's not that uncommon...")
('Van', "...but I'm more thinking it was a hoax.")
('Bermotti', 'Indeed, it was. The police arrested several from the<br/>scene, but they found no evidence that drugs ever<br/>changed hands.')
('Bermotti', 'However, it did look like they were in the middle of a<br/>dispute of some kind—but who the other party was,<br/>they could not ascertain.')
('Bermotti', 'The ones caught were also saying something along<br/>the lines of...')
('Bermotti', "'Who ratted us out?'<br/>'THEY wouldn't have done it...so was it someone<br/>on our side?'")
('Van', 'Huh.')
('Agnès', "Erm... Judging by all you've said...")
('Agnès', "...it sounds like those criminals and that other party<br/>were still scheduled to do some kind of deal, even if it<br/>wasn't drug related...")
('Agnès', '...and Giacomo called the police on them, creating<br/>confusion by doing so?')
('Bermotti', 'Well, well.')
('Van', "Yeah. You're dead on.")
('Van', "He then took advantage of that to make off with<br/>somethin' from the scene...")
('Van', '...and ended up with a one-way ticket to the other<br/>side for it.')
('Agnès', '...!')
('Bermotti', "My thinking is along the same line as yours, though I<br/>haven't got a clue what the 'something' in question is.")
('Bermotti', 'As for how he was able to make off with it<br/>completely undetected, I can only speculate.')
('Bermotti', 'There must have been some kind of trick to it.')
('Van', "You don't think he used a Xipha, do you?")
('Bermotti', "No. There still aren't many of them in circulation.")
('Bermotti', 'I think he used the previous model—which fit his<br/>objective much better.')
('Bermotti', "There's a fair number of them making the rounds on<br/>the black market these days.")
('Van', 'A RAMDA, huh?')
('Agnès', "Calvard's fifth-generation orbment?")
('Van', 'Yeah. The one developed between Verne and the<br/>Epstein Foundation a while back.')
('Van', "It was used by the police and army for a while, but<br/>soon as the sixth gen was introduced, they wasted no<br/>time dumpin' it.")
('Van', "Xipha's better, sure, but the RAMDA was just as<br/>good as Erebonia's ARCUS back then, with its most<br/>notable feature being stealth capabilities.")
('Agnès', 'So you think he used that stealth to hide something?')
('Bermotti', "Quite. Well, less 'something' and more<br/>'someone'—himself. It lets you disappear as if<br/>by magic.")
('Bermotti', "How long it lasts depends on the user, and it can't<br/>avoid tripping sensors...")
('Bermotti', "...but slipping into a scene that's already in disarray<br/>and stealing something? That would be child's play.")
('Agnès', 'Hmm... That does all make sense.')
('Van', 'Puts it all into perspective for us, huh?')
('Van', 'When we charged into the maintenance room after<br/>hearing a scream...')
('Van', "...all we found was Giacomo's corpse.")
('Van', "But we weren't the only people who were there.")
('Van', 'The criminals who slit his throat were still there, too.')
('Van', "They just snuck right past us using RAMDA's<br/>stealth capabilities.")
('Agnès', '...')
('Bermotti', 'What fearless criminals they are. Certainly not<br/>bottom of the barrel.')
('Bermotti', 'We could be dealing with jaegers. Or perhaps...')
('Bermotti', "Whoever they are, they've recovered what they're<br/>looking for, so I doubt you'll find success in pursuing<br/>them any further.")
('Van', "Oh, I wouldn't be so sure about that.")
('Bermotti', 'Oh?')
('Van', "Knew he wouldn't keep me waiting.")
('Dingo', 'Here are all the bases he used for the past few years,<br/>complete with security logs.')
('Van', "Thanks. We'll call this even.")
('Dingo', "Heh. Oh, and just to add, there's been no sign of any<br/>jaeger corps on the move as of yesterday.")
('Dingo', 'Well, be seeing you.')
('Van', "All right. Guess I'm in your debt again.")
('Agnès', 'What was that all about...?')
('Bermotti', 'So Giacomo had multiple hideouts, did he?')
('Bermotti', "That could mean whatever he stole is in one of those.<br/>But if it wasn't a jaeger corps he had a run-in with...")
('Bermotti', "Oh, forget it. I can't believe you turned to Dingo!")
('Bermotti', "And right in FRONT of me! You know I'll sing like a<br/>canary for you any day of the week!")
('Van', 'Heh. Sorry, but I never was much of the faithful type.')
('Van', '...')
('Agnès', 'Well, we got a lot of new information out of that...')
('Agnès', "I'm just...surprised at how well connected you are.")
('Van', "What can I say? I spend time puttin' people in my<br/>debt so I can cash in favors when I need 'em.")
('Elaine', 'You must have amassed quite a collection by now.')
('Van', 'Uh...')
('Agnès', 'Oh...')
('Agnès', 'OH!')
('Elaine', "I'd heard you were a regular at this establishment...")
('Elaine', "...but I wasn't expecting to run into you just as it<br/>was opening.")
('Van', 'Heh. That makes two of us.')
('Van', 'First René, then you. Hell of a day for me.')
('Elaine', "You've certainly spent a lot of it skulking around.<br/>Up to no good, I assume.")
('Elaine', 'I imagine it was half your own fault that you got<br/>hauled off to the police station.')
('Van', "Wish I could argue otherwise... Should've known it<br/>wouldn't take long for you to hear about what<br/>happened and come runnin'.")
('Elaine', "Of course. I've paid a visit to the scene of the crime<br/>as well.")
('Elaine', 'Giacomo was hardly a pleasant person, but he was a<br/>decent informant to use when work called for one.')
('Elaine', 'I hope you know that the detectives at the station and<br/>that reporter are very displeased with you, by the way.')
('Elaine', 'Your love of causing trouble for everyone and taking<br/>advantage of it to further your own goals has never<br/>been a bright spot for you.')
('Van', "Don't got a clue what you're talkin' about.<br/>(Damn, this is awkward...)")
('Agnès', "I can't believe it...")
('Elaine', "Forgive me. My name is Elaine. I'm sorry for<br/>interrupting your conversation.")
('Agnès', 'O-Oh, not at all.')
('Elaine', "I think we have much to discuss, but we're also both<br/>busy, so that can wait for another time.")
('Elaine', 'Whoever can solve this case first—the CID, the<br/>police, the guild—wins the prize lying in wait.')
('Elaine', 'That also goes for our presumed suspects.')
('Elaine', "I'm sure you know who I'm talking about. Be careful<br/>not to get too involved here, Van.")
('Elaine', "I'm almost certain that the two people who killed<br/>Giacomo were from A.")
('Van', "Thinkin' the same. But I'll chalk myself up to owin'<br/>you one for tellin' me.")
('Agnès', 'Y-You know her?!')
('Van', 'What, you do, too? Guess she does pop up in the<br/>paper every once in a blue moon.')
('Agnès', "Of COURSE I know her! She's really famous!")
('Agnès', "I don't think there's anyone in Calvard who<br/>DOESN'T know the face of Elaine Auclair!")
('Agnès', "She's one of the youngest bracers ever to reach<br/>A-rank in the guild! Their ace!")
('Agnès', "A-And they even call her...I can't remember, but it's<br/>something like—")
('Van', "—Beauty's Blade. Elegant enough for someone so<br/>adept with the swordsmanship of the old kingdom.")
('Van', "Heh. Hard not to feel for her for having 'beauty'<br/>slapped on her title.")
('Agnès', 'Are... Are the two of you close?')
('Van', "She's just an old friend. Anyway, we've wasted<br/>enough time here.")
('Van', "We almost got this one in the bag. We can talk stuff<br/>through while we're on the move.")
('Agnès', 'Hmm? Who are you calling?')
('Van', 'That hulking bear who pushed the job on us,<br/>of course.')
('Agnès', 'I see...')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Hey, Arkride. All taken care of?')
('Van', 'Will you stop reading me like a damn book?')
('Van', 'Took care of both the monster and that optional one.<br/>My own way, though.')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Haha. Hey, if it works.')
('Zin the Immovable', "I know your style's not the same as ours, but I can<br/>trust you to handle it.")
('Van', "Tch. Don't know why you would.")
('Van', "Took care of the monster. Couldn't do the other<br/>one, though.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'No worries. Another bracer can cover that<br/>one tomorrow.')
('Zin the Immovable', "I'll wire you the money ASAP. Thanks for the<br/>save, man.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Looking forward to the next job with you!')
('Van', "You have GOT to be kiddin' me.")
('Zin the Immovable', "Oh, yeah. Elaine's on a transcontinental train going<br/>the opposite way.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'She should still be in Xipha range if you want me<br/>to—')
('Van', "I'm good! Ugh!")
('Zin the Immovable', "Hahaha. Well, see ya 'round!")
('Van', "A wolf in sheep's clothing, that guy. What a monster.")
('Agnès', "Ahaha... I can see why he's so well respected at<br/>the guild.")
('Agnès', 'I heard he was integral to quelling a big problem in<br/>the Liberl Kingdom in the past.')
('Van', 'Huh. They teach that in class? Yeah, it was about six<br/>years back.')
('Van', 'Around the same time that... Heh.')
('Agnès', 'Hmm?')
('Van', '...')
('Agnès', 'Van?')
('Van', "It's nothin'. Like I said, we're still clocked in until<br/>we're back at the office.")
('Van', 'We can afford to stop by a few spots for some dessert<br/>on the way back, though.')
('Agnès', 'Well, if you say so. Heehee. That sounds right<br/>for you.')
('Agnès', "(Am I imagining things? It feels like there's more to<br/>this than his sweet tooth.)")
('System', 'Received')
('System', 'Visit places where sweet foods are sold around<br/>Riverside, Station Street, and Old Town.')
('Renne', "I'm glad the rain finally let up. The weather<br/>tomorrow should be lovely.")
('Van', "Yeah. The forecast's clear skies all day for<br/>the southeast.")
('Van', 'But should you even be out this late? You just told<br/>your friend to hurry back.')
('Renne', "Why, I'm out on patrol, silly! I have to make sure<br/>students are behaving themselves—new and old alike.")
('Van', 'Yeah, whatever you say.')
('Van', "Heh... It HAS been a while, huh, Kitty? Or would<br/>you rather I called you 'Renne Bright' these days?")
('Renne', 'Call me whatever you like—though I am pretty used<br/>to my new name now.')
('Renne', "It's really good to see you, too, spriggan.")
('Renne', 'I came over as an exchange student this past spring,<br/>but had I known how much you missed me, I would<br/>have paid you a visit a lot sooner.')
('Van', "Nah. No need to go outta your way just 'cause<br/>you're a former client.")
('Van', "Hell, I wasn't even a pro when I helped you.<br/>Didn't have my current office or anything!")
('Van', "And I mean, we have kind of crossed paths since.<br/>Like with that case with the pampered<br/>politician's son.")
('Renne', 'Heehee. I had a feeling you might be involved with<br/>that based on what that reporter was telling me<br/>about it.')
('Renne', "I didn't think I'd end up Student Council president as<br/>a result of it all—but it's been a lot more fun than I<br/>was expecting.")
('Van', 'Glad to hear it.')
('Van', 'Man. Five years since we first met through that<br/>introduction letter from the meister, huh?<br/>Where does time go.')
('Renne', "Indeed. You really helped shake off the professor's<br/>attempts to follow me.")
('Renne', "Not to mention helping the meister with<br/>his...'relocation' after all that chaos in Crossbell.")
('Van', 'I mean, I was in his debt to begin with.')
('Van', 'Ended up dumping a couple of kids with a bit of a<br/>history on him, too.')
('Van', "Wasn't really expectin' anything in return, so I was<br/>pretty surprised when that gift showed up.")
('Renne', "Oh, the turbocharger? Heehee. I'm glad you're<br/>enjoying it.")
('Renne', 'My best friend and I were actually involved in<br/>designing it, you know.')
('Van', 'Hold on, really?')
('Van', "I could tell it was pretty high tech and all, but I didn't<br/>realize you were behind that.")
('Renne', 'Well, I heard that you were a sobbing mess after<br/>Walter turned your old truck inside out.')
('Renne', "So I thought maybe you could use a little pick-me-up.<br/>You know...for old times' sake.")
('Van', 'Sheesh... That figures.')
('Van', "Still. I'm guessin' the society must be feelin' the<br/>pressure at this point.")
('Van', "They've had a lotta dropouts the past few years—<br/>you included.")
('Van', "Just so long as they don't come lookin' for my help.<br/>You I can handle, but those other wackos?<br/>No, thanks.")
('Renne', 'But you have such a natural talent for attracting them!')
('Renne', "They do say birds of a feather flock together, though.<br/>I'm afraid you're likely to meet more of them as time<br/>goes on.")
('Van', "I'm just a normal, upstanding citizen. What'd I do to<br/>deserve this?")
('Renne', 'Protest all you like, but you do seem awfully<br/>popular lately.')
('Renne', "In fact, it looks like you've got another vicious young<br/>woman looking to get her hands on you. Ooh!<br/>How dreadful!")
('Van', '...')
('Kilika', "Oh, I think I'm a little past 'young' at this point.")
('Van', 'Heh. Oh, boy.')
('Renne', 'And such perfect timing, too.')
('Renne', 'Thank you for making time to meet with us. I know<br/>how busy you are.')
('Kilika', 'Think nothing of it. I have some other business to<br/>take care of outside of the office as it is.')
('Van', "You're René's boss, right? Heard a lot about you.")
('Van', "Didn't realize the Flying Swallow was so fond of<br/>practical jokes. Was the lurkin' in the shadows bit<br/>really necessary?")
('Kilika', 'Haha. My apologies.')
('Kilika', "My name is Kilika Rouran, chief of the CID's<br/>Integrated Analysis Division.")
('Kilika', "It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Arkride.")
('Kilika', 'Even if this does not quite feel like our first meeting.')
('Van', "No doubt. I'm sure he's told you a lot about me, huh?")
('Kilika', 'That he did. Including everything that went on<br/>behind the scenes two years ago.')
('Van', "Haven't got a clue what you're talkin' about.")
('Renne', 'Looks like bringing you two together was worth it<br/>after all.')
('Renne', "It's nice to see you again, Ms. Rouran. It's been<br/>what...four years now?")
('Kilika', 'The same to you. Our positions may be different, but<br/>we need not be at odds with one another, Ms. Bright.')
('Kilika', "I'm glad we have a chance to catch up—of course, I'm<br/>pleased to make your acquaintance as well,<br/>Mr. Arkride.")
('Van', "It's getting to be more like a real tea party<br/>every minute.")
('Renne', 'Maybe I should have invited Sylphid along after all?')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Sorry for the wait, Kilika—er, what did I just walk<br/>in on?')
('Kilika', "I should think that's obvious, Zin.")
('Kilika', 'And I had hoped you would be more punctual,<br/>considering this is our first meal together in<br/>some time.')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Sorry, an urgent job came in. I finished it off as<br/>quickly as I could.')
('Zin the Immovable', "I wasn't expecting to find the two of you<br/>here, though.")
('Renne', "It's good to see you again, too.")
('Renne', "I know we've spoken a few times over the phone, but<br/>I think it's been about a year and a half since we last<br/>met up in-person.")
('Zin the Immovable', "Oh, yeah. That was at the wedding, wasn't it?")
('Zin the Immovable', "Man... You've really grown up. Hard to believe you're<br/>that same little girl that knocked us out in Grancel all<br/>those years ago.")
('Renne', 'Oh, right! I nearly forgot about that.')
('Van', "You nearly forgot? Yeesh... You are somethin'<br/>else, kid.")
('Kilika', "Well, everything happens for a reason, they say.<br/>We wouldn't be here talking now if it wasn't for that.")
('Zin the Immovable', "Oh, now I see what's going on here. I thought it was<br/>odd when you told me you wanted to visit.<br/>Should've known you already had company.")
('Kilika', "Now don't give me that jealous look, Zin. It's less<br/>cute on a man your age. I promise I'll buy you a drink<br/>to make up for it.")
('Van', 'You two might not be in the same line of work<br/>anymore, but it looks to me like not much has<br/>changed since your days back at the dojo.')
('Van', 'You sure you really need help from a guy like me?')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Oh, definitely.')
('Zin the Immovable', "We've barely been managing to make ends meet since<br/>Fie got here. We're going to need the help for a<br/>while, I think.")
('Kilika', "You're extremely well connected, too.")
('Kilika', "I'm told you even have ties to another Taito student.")
('Renne', 'As a matter of fact, we were actually just talking<br/>about that before you got here.')
('Renne', "It's like he fits right in no matter whose side he's on.<br/>Hmm... How should I put it? He's... He's like<br/>a singularity.")
('Zin the Immovable', "Yeah. If you wanna know something, Arkride's<br/>your guy.")
('Van', "Hey, lay off with that singularity business! I don't<br/>appreciate bein' talked about like a research<br/>specimen, okay?")
('Van', "And just so we're clear, you guys might not be as bad<br/>as the Direwolf or Cao, but you're still a major pain in<br/>the ass!")
('Zin the Immovable', "Haha. Can't say I don't get where you're<br/>coming from.")
('Zin the Immovable', "So, what's the plan? I've got a reservation not too long<br/>from now at a restaurant near here. You<br/>coming, Kilika?")
('Kilika', "Of course. I think I've played my part here.")
('Kilika', "I'll see you both again sometime. Take care<br/>in Tharbad.")
('Van', "Sheesh... Is there anybody around here that doesn't<br/>know my itinerary?")
('Van', "That aside, I guess you're not totally on board with<br/>the guild yet, after all, huh?")
('Renne', "We do work together sometimes, but I'm not a bracer<br/>like my siblings, after all.")
('Renne', "I just do what I can to help and try to offer them my<br/>knowledge if I know it'll help the people I care for.")
('Renne', 'Both in Liberl and in Crossbell.')
('Renne', "I've been adding a lot of people here in Calvard to<br/>that list, too, lately.")
('Van', "That's good to hear.")
('Renne', "Well, I should be getting home. Estelle and Joshua<br/>will be wondering where I've gotten to.")
('Renne', "I'll be counting on you to take care of Agnès while<br/>she's with you.")
('Van', "I'll do what I can.")
('Van', "Though, aren't the Brights back in Liberl? You goin'<br/>all the way back there? Just like that?")
('Renne', '...Oh. Yes, of course. Home is...far away.<br/>Being around so many familiar faces made me think I<br/>was back there, I suppose.')
('Renne', "I'm so ashamed. A girl on the cusp of adulthood<br/>should be a little more...focused.")
('Van', "Think you're giving adults a little too much credit<br/>there, kiddo.")
('Renne', '...')
('Van', "When I found you five years ago, you were still lost<br/>and tryin' to find your place in the world.")
('Van', "I'd only just finished my training and was still gettin'<br/>a feel for what it was to be a spriggan.")
('Van', "I'll admit I kept you safe for a while and gave you a<br/>few pointers, but...I never really could do much<br/>for you.")
('Van', 'Meanwhile, you managed to build yourself a new life,<br/>new friendships—hell, a whole new family―all on<br/>your own.')
('Van', "You're no lost kitten anymore. You're as fine a lady<br/>as any.")
('Renne', '...')
('Renne', 'So, is this how you treat all the young ladies you keep<br/>company with?')
('Van', 'Oh. Uhh... Guess not.')
('Renne', 'You say you never did much for me, but you give<br/>yourself far too little credit.')
('Renne', "It's not just me you've helped, either—take your old<br/>friend, that bracer girl, for example.")
('Renne', 'Or what about your assistants, including my<br/>dear dormmate?')
('Renne', "You help more people than you think. People who<br/>wouldn't have found themselves without you to take<br/>them by the hand and show them the way.")
('Van', 'I...')
('Renne', 'If you ask me, you need to be a little more aware of<br/>the impact your words and deeds have had on people.')
('Renne', 'If you can manage that, then I might even be willing<br/>to overlook a little headpat every now and again. ❤')
('Van', '...')
('Renne', "Heehee. And with that, I think I'll be off now.<br/>Good night...Mr. Spriggan.")
('Van', "Yeah. G'night.")
('Van', "(Man, she's grown more than I could've ever<br/>imagined—and I know she's nowhere near done.)")
('Van', "(I'll have to keep an eye on her the same way I do my<br/>part-timers now that fate's brought us back together<br/>like this.)")
('System', 'After leaving the district, they made their way to the<br/>surface, following a different route.')
(500, 'October 18th, 5:05PM')
('Van', "Damn, it's already this late? We were down there<br/>a while.")
('Feri', 'It connects to the Riverside District, too?')
('Feri', 'Feels like waking up from a dream...')
('Aaron', 'Heh. Guess it was all a bit too much for a kid.')
('Aaron', 'Speaking of kids, seems like that boy we ran into is<br/>the son of a jaeger.')
('Feri', 'I really liked it down there! Shady criminals excluded.')
('Feri', 'It was like a conflict could break out at any<br/>second—a perfect place for training!')
('Aaron', 'Not this again...')
('Risette', "At least it hadn't fully descended into anarchy, even if<br/>the rules were somewhat lax.")
('Risette', "It seemed like a good place to procure goods and<br/>materials you can't get on the surface.")
('Van', "Yeah. Don't want anyone getting hooked on the<br/>place, but use it when you need to—just follow<br/>the rules.")
('Van', 'That goes for you in particular, Aaron.')
('Aaron', '*whistle*')
('Agnès', '...')
('Feri', "You okay, Agnès? You're awfully quiet.")
('Agnès', "N-No! I'm perfectly fine.")
('Agnès', "It was just a lot to take in. I'm feeling a bit of culture<br/>shock, I suppose.")
('Risette', '...I can hardly blame you.')
('Feri', "I-I'm sorry! I was probably making you feel even<br/>worse with how carried away I was getting.")
('Agnès', "Oh, you don't need to feel responsible!")
('Agnès', "It's just... Umm... To be honest, I've got something<br/>else on my mind, too.")
('Van', "It does kinda feel like something's been eating at<br/>you lately.")
('Van', 'Worried about things at school?')
('Agnès', "Y-Yes, actually... There's a major opportunity coming<br/>up that I was considering opting into.")
('Agnès', "But I think I've decided against it.")
('Agnès', "There's nothing more it can teach me that I haven't<br/>learned already, after all.")
('Feri', 'Oh?')
('Aaron', 'Hmm?')
('Prince Sherid', 'Our information did not lead us astray, I see.')
('Prince Sherid', "It's good to see you all, my friends.")
('Naje', 'That it is.')
('Agnès', 'Your Highness!')
('Feri', 'Naje!')
('Aaron', "Damn. Talk about showin' up unexpected.")
('Van', "Ugh... So this is what the chief was talkin' about.")
('Kincaid', 'Correct.')
('Kincaid', 'His Highness and I have something to discuss<br/>with you. Please, climb in.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Dingooo...why won't you just listen to meee?")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'I... I need you with me at the Tyrell Times...')
('Dingo', "Like I said, I'll leave the honest journalism to you.")
('Dingo', 'Sorry for the trouble, Bermotti.')
('Bermotti', "Oh, please! This is nothing. Don't you worry about<br/>a thing.")
('Bermotti', "Still, if you ask me, I think you're more than ready to<br/>leave the back alleys yourself.")
('Bermotti', "It's been eight years, you know.")
('Dingo', "It's not a matter of how much time's passed.<br/>Besides, I feel like my current path suits me better at<br/>this point.")
('Dingo', 'You should be saying that to Van...')
('Bermotti', 'Oh, my. Is that him, cheating on me with Shino?')
('Bermotti', "I can't say I'm not jealous, but she's been refining her<br/>craft a lot lately—")
('Bermotti', 'Oh, my. Oh, my! My, my, MY!')
('Dingo', 'Heh. Looks like our boy might finally be starting to<br/>move on.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Mmm... I wanna chase scoops togetheeer...')
('Shino', 'Here are the Gimlet and Grasshopper that<br/>you ordered.')
('Van', "Thanks. They've both got just the right amount<br/>of foam.")
('Elaine', "Your shaking technique has really improved, Shino.<br/>I'm impressed.")
('Shino', "Thank you for saying so, but I'm still not a patch<br/>on Bermotti. Well, please enjoy your drinks.")
('Elaine', 'This is lovely. Still, I see you like even your<br/>cocktails sweet.')
('Van', 'Well, not all the time.')
('Van', "Come to think of it, I've shot back a few with René,<br/>but I guess this is my first time doing it with<br/>you, huh?")
('Elaine', "We were too young, remember? Although, I suppose<br/>that didn't stop you at the school festival afterparty.")
('Van', "*whistle* I got no idea what you're talkin' about.")
('Elaine', "I swear, you two are why they say 'boys will be boys.'<br/>Haha.")
('Van', 'Hahaha...')
('Elaine', "Considering someone has been avoiding me these<br/>past four years, we really haven't run into each<br/>other much...")
('Elaine', "But come to think of it, we've ended up with a lot of<br/>shared acquaintances. Bermotti, Shino...")
('Elaine', 'And I suppose even that actress qualifies now.')
('Van', "Hey, don't look at me like that. She's just a client,<br/>that's all.")
('Van', "It's just what happens when two folks work the<br/>same city.")
('Van', 'Especially when our jobs are like two sides of the<br/>same coin.')
('Elaine', "I suppose you're right...though what does that<br/>make René? Heads or tails?")
('Van', "He's the edge of the coin. Or the guy with the coin in<br/>the palm of his hand.")
('Elaine', '*sigh* Good point.')
('Elaine', "I thought he'd made a very fitting career choice when<br/>he decided to join the Ministry of Home Affairs<br/>before graduation.")
('Elaine', "I never expected he'd end up transferring to the CID<br/>when it was established and become a rival of sorts.")
('Van', "That's just the kind of guy he is. Like how he acts like<br/>a venerable older brother figure, even though he's<br/>only a year older than us.")
('Elaine', "Incidentally, he seemed surprised when he learned I<br/>was joining the guild. Happily, he wasn't<br/>opposed, either.")
('Elaine', 'He was like my only ally, outside my circle of<br/>friends...after a certain someone disappeared.')
('Van', 'Erk...')
('Elaine', "Haha... You really haven't changed at all, these last<br/>seven years.")
('Elaine', 'Or the last fifteen, for that matter.')
('Van', "While we're talking about not changing, you do know<br/>it's your fault I ended up with such a sweet<br/>tooth, right?")
('Van', 'All you did was stuff a poor, impressionable Van full<br/>of chocolate and macarons from your family biz all<br/>the time.')
('Elaine', 'Mmm, perhaps. But René got just as stuffed and<br/>avoided sugar addiction, so I can only think you were<br/>doomed to end up this way regardless.')
('Elaine', "I really don't remember you having this much of a<br/>sweet tooth when you were younger, though. Are you<br/>sure something didn't happen after—")
('Van', '...')
('Elaine', "...I'm sorry. I didn't mean to rip at old scars.")
('Van', "Heh. Haven't got a clue what you're talkin' about.")
('Van', "Still. I don't have any regrets about ending up<br/>this way. Adds a bit of fun to life.")
('Van', "My employees always look at me funny, but if they're<br/>gonna complain about me loving sweet stuff, they can<br/>give theirs to me, I say.")
('Elaine', 'Heehee...')
('Elaine', 'I...still have mixed feelings about your career choice.')
('Elaine', "But I've been feeling a little better about it, lately,<br/>seeing the sort of people you're attracting.")
('Elaine', "I really didn't expect you to end up with a student of<br/>Professor Hamilton working under you, though.")
('Van', "'Attracting' is definitely the right word. It's like I'm a<br/>magnet for hard cases these days.")
('Van', "Well, I guess Risette's technically different since she's<br/>on loan from Marduk.")
('Elaine', "I'm honestly shocked at just how much you seem to<br/>trust her.")
('Elaine', 'Not that I have any doubts about how capable she is,<br/>given her employer.')
('Van', "Oh, she's capable all right—and I know I can<br/>trust her. Just wish I could say the same about<br/>her bosses.")
('Van', "Marduk... So shady, you can see the shadow for selge.<br/>You ain't got anything on them, do you?")
('Elaine', "They're as much of an enigma to us as the society is,<br/>I'm afraid.")
('Elaine', "Still, you're the one who has a contract with them.<br/>Good job, signing away your soul to the<br/>selge-long shadow.")
('Van', 'Ugh... Bah. Shino! Bring me an Alexander, would ya?')
('Elaine', 'I would like a White Lady, please.')
('Shino', 'Certainly.')
('Van', "Damn... I really wasn't expectin' you to go and foot<br/>the bill.")
('Van', "How's a guy supposed to look suave if you won't even<br/>let him pick up the check?")
('Elaine', "I was the one who invited you here. And, please, that<br/>idea's so old-fashioned it's covered in moss.")
('Elaine', "You're going away next weekend with your<br/>team, right? If you really want to buy someone<br/>something nice, treat them instead.")
('Elaine', "Besides, I'm sure you're already aware, but being an<br/>A-rank bracer pays rather well.")
('Van', "Geez... Rub it in some more, why don'tcha?")
('Elaine', 'You can treat next time.')
('Elaine', 'How does that sound?')
('Van', "You're on. The tab'll be way bigger next<br/>time, anyway.")
('Van', 'Could always call René, too... Ooh, wait. I got a<br/>better idea.')
('Van', "Let's save that for when we go some place<br/>REALLY expensive. In his line of work, the guy's<br/>probably loaded by now.")
('Elaine', 'Oh, you...')
('Elaine', "I'm going to take a cab home. You're taking the<br/>subway back, right?")
('Van', 'Yeah. No buses run this late at night.')
('Van', "Night, Elaine. Here's to...a good working relationship<br/>from here on out.")
('Elaine', 'That will be entirely dependent on you.<br/>...Good night, Van.')
('Elaine', 'Van!')
('Van', "...Hmm? What's up?")
('Elaine', 'Are you... Are you really going to go on that trip?')
('Van', 'Wha...?')
('Van', "What's gotten into—?")
('Elaine', "It's nothing. I-I hope you have a good time.")
('Elaine', "Don't forget...you're a leader now. Don't get too<br/>carried away out there, okay?")
('Van', "(What was that all about? Haven't seen her act like<br/>that since we were kids.)")
('Van', '(...)')
('Van', "(It's been so long since we first met in Oración, all<br/>those years ago.)")
('Van', "(She was the daughter of the biggest family in the<br/>area, René was the son of a government man slavin'<br/>away his life far from home, and I...)")
('Van', "(Sounds like she stopped talkin' to her family after<br/>joining the guild, though.)")
('Van', "(Maybe there's some kinda problem in her personal<br/>life she's not talking about?)")
('Van', "(Not like it'll make up for what happened seven years<br/>ago, but maybe I should talk to her about<br/>it sometime.)")
('Judith', 'This is one of your favorite spots, right? Full of the<br/>law-abiding and the lawless!')
('Van', "Yeah. It's one of the best places to hit up if you're<br/>looking for info.")
('Van', "Let's head in.")
('Agnès', 'All right...')
('Bermotti', 'Van...')
('Jack', 'Long time no see.')
('Halle', "Yeah. It's been about two months, I think?")
('Feri', "Oh! We didn't know you two would be here!")
('Van', 'Hey, guys.')
('Aaron', 'Well, this is a shocker.')
('Halle', "You're looking well, Aaron.")
('Jack', "Didn't think for a second he wouldn't be.")
('Halle', "Ashen told us about what happened. It's so awful...")
('Agnès', 'Yes, it is...')
('Bermotti', "Please have a seat, everyone. I'm sure we have a lot to<br/>talk about.")
('Agnès', 'So you were acquainted with Dingo, too, Jack?')
('Jack', "Yeah. I'm five years his senior, and even as capable as<br/>he is, he was kind of like a little brother to me.")
('Bermotti', "I call the capital my home, while Jack's is<br/>in Langport.")
('Bermotti', "Meanwhile, Dingo's work led him all around<br/>the country.")
('Bermotti', 'The three of us all had other careers, but we dealt in<br/>information, too, and got along great.')
('Jack', 'Yeah. Sometimes one of us would outwit the others,<br/>but none of us ever crossed the line like Giacomo did.')
('Jack', "Still hard to believe he's dead, too...")
('Bermotti', "Giacomo got what was coming to him, but Dingo<br/>didn't deserve that at all!")
('Jack', "I know. That's why me and Halle are here.")
('Halle', "To help you guys figure out what Almata's up to.")
('Halle', "I've had some dealings with them in the past, too—<br/>which is all the more reason I feel like I should be<br/>here to help.")
('Aaron', 'Huh? What do you mean?')
('Agnès', 'Was there some kind of conflict between you and<br/>Almata in the past?')
('Halle', 'Well...we were involved in the events that led to<br/>Dantès taking over.')
('Halle', "As I'm sure you've heard, Almata weren't half as bad<br/>before him.")
('Van', 'Yeah. The story goes that he was their underboss<br/>back in the day, then made their former boss pay the<br/>price for screwing up.')
('Van', "It sounds like he got what was coming to him, and<br/>Dantès was never gonna be satisfied servin' under a<br/>two-bit thug like him to begin with.")
('Jack', 'Yeah. For being this big, scary mafia boss, Enrique<br/>was basically leading two things—jack and shit—and<br/>Jack left town.')
('Jack', "Meanwhile, Dantès is as dangerous as they come, and<br/>he's drawn the ire of every major player on<br/>the continent.")
('Halle', "Yeah... It sounds like Heiyue's elders are finally<br/>planning to do something about the problem, too.")
('Halle', "I've heard rumors they're already making their move.")
('Aaron', 'Heh. About damn time.')
('Judith', "(I wonder if that means she's working with them,<br/>too...?)")
('Bermotti', 'Word is that some famous jaegers outside the<br/>Republic are also looking to get involved.')
('Bermotti', 'The church and the society are getting ready, too.')
('Feri', "The society again, huh? They were in the Blacklight<br/>District the other day, weren't they?")
('Van', 'Makes sense the church would be acting, considering<br/>that bomb was blown up using an artifact.')
('Jack', "Sounds like it's not just the guys you'd expect, either.")
('Jack', "I've heard talk that there's another armed group in the<br/>church on the move.")
('Risette', '(I wonder if that relates to the other man we saw in<br/>the Blacklight District...?)')
('Van', 'Hmm... That is interesting.')
('Van', "I know they took part in Mille Mirage two years ago,<br/>but they don't normally interfere in other countries'<br/>affairs, do they?")
('Bermotti', "Apparently, they have been a lot lately—seemingly at<br/>the behest of whoever's at the top.")
('Agnès', 'Umm...')
('Quatre', 'I never associated the church with armed combat in<br/>the first place, so this is all a bit of a surprise.')
('Judith', 'I wonder what the society is after in all of this?')
('Judith', "It seems like they've been after Almata for a<br/>while now.")
('Feri', 'Yeah. That Direwolf guy was looking for Melchior<br/>the first time we ran into him.')
('Bermotti', "Indeed. I've heard the Direwolf was pursuing<br/>Melchior for a while.")
('Bermotti', 'It sounds like they were up to something in<br/>Tharbad, too.')
('Risette', 'During the film festival? Hmm... He did not get<br/>involved directly in the chaos, at least.')
('Van', 'I see.')
('Van', "Perhaps there's some kinda shady connection<br/>between the society and Almata—or the Gardens, for<br/>that matter.")
('Van', "At the very least we can take some solace in the fact<br/>they're definitely not working together.")
('Judith', "It's hard to imagine how the current situation could<br/>get any worse, but I suppose that is something...")
('Agnès', "Everything hinges on Almata's next move,<br/>I suppose...")
('Jack', "Yeah. The current deadlock ain't gonna last.<br/>Someone's gonna act out sooner or later, and I'm<br/>betting it'll be sooner.")
('Halle', "You can count on us when it comes to info. We'll let<br/>you know as soon as we hear anything of interest.")
('Van', "'Preciate that. You guys just stay out of trouble out<br/>there, all right?")
('Aaron', "Pfft, Halle will be fine, but Jack's gonna have to avoid<br/>drinking himself into an early grave.")
('Jack', 'All right, all right! Shit...')
('Bermotti', 'Oh, wait! Before you go.')
('Bermotti', 'You remember Marielle, the young lady who was<br/>always chasing after Dingo, right?')
('Bermotti', "You...haven't seen her today, have you?")
('Van', '...Nah. Afraid not.')
('Agnès', "I haven't seen her ever since the emergency<br/>declaration was put into effect, come to think of it.")
('Judith', "She...really looked up to Dingo, didn't she? The news<br/>must have been a real shock.")
('Bermotti', "I've heard she's been desperately seeking out<br/>information on what happened, but...I'm worried<br/>she's going to get herself into trouble.")
('Van', "I see what you mean... All right, we'll try and keep an<br/>eye out for her.")
('Van', 'Damn...')
('Shizuna', 'It looks like time has stopped in this area, too.')
('Feri', 'The effect extends this far, huh?')
('Fie', 'Yeah. There are a lot more people frozen here than in<br/>Old Town, too.')
('Risette', 'The effect extends this far, too, I see.')
('Cao', 'I expected as much.')
('Feri', 'This area has been frozen, too...')
('Risette', "Indeed—even if there aren't as many people frozen in<br/>time here as there are in front of the station.")
('Fie', "We should probably assume the whole city's like this<br/>at this point.")
('Cao', 'I suspect the entire city is in the same state.')
('Van', "Here they come! And something's tellin' me they<br/>won't be as much of a pushover as the others.")
('Shizuna', "Heh. Looks like—these seem like they'll put up much<br/>more of a fight.")
('Feri', 'Evil spirits sighted!')
('Fie', "These look like they've been enhanced by a demon<br/>sphere, too!")
('Risette', 'Here they come!')
('Cao', 'These look to have been enhanced by a demon sphere<br/>as well.')
('Feri', 'O Arusha, grant us your protection!')
('Risette', 'We shall defeat them swiftly!')
('Fie', "This'll be a breeze!")
('Cao', 'This will barely take a moment!')
('Van', "That takes care of 'em. What was up with those auras<br/>they had, though?")
('Shizuna', "I'm wondering the same thing. They were in a<br/>different league compared to the last batch.")
('Van', 'Whew... These things are still a real headache.')
('Feri', 'At least they were kinda small.')
('Risette', 'At least they were comparatively low-level devils.')
('Van', "The demon spheres're gonna have to buff 'em up a<br/>hell of a lot more than that if they want 'em to stand a<br/>chance against this crew.")
('Feri', 'Yeah!')
('Risette', 'That said, we still cannot afford to let our guard down<br/>against them.')
('Van', 'Wha—?!')
('Shizuna', 'Oh? Planning to overwhelm us with numbers,<br/>are you?')
('Fie', "There's so many of them!")
('Cao', 'Oh, my.')
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', 'Stay back.')
('Van', 'That looked like—')
('Feri', 'K-Kasim?!')
('Risette', 'Mr. Al-Fayed!')
('Harwood', 'Hey there. Figured you guys would get involved.')
('Feri', '...')
('Risette', 'Poison...?')
('Shizuna', 'Heh. Looks like we were fortunate not to get to see<br/>that in action in Oración.')
('Fie', "I've heard that he's a criminal genius and renowned<br/>for his poisons, but...")
('Cao', 'Hmm... It looks significantly more potent than the<br/>poison we make use of, too.')
('Van', "Bah. He feels like he's more of a malevolent force<br/>than whatever WE'RE up against.")
('Bermotti', "I couldn't agree more.")
('Van', "Good to see you safe, Bermotti. And you're...")
('Syd', "Oh, you're the guy Aaron's staying with, right?!")
('Syd', "Ugh... Please! You've gotta help him!")
('Feri', 'Wh-What do you mean?')
('Risette', 'Has something happened to him?')
('Van', 'I...')
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', "I'll leave the explaining to you, Bermotti.")
('Harwood', "We're getting out of here. Catch you later.")
('Feri', 'Wh-What?!')
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', "I'm glad you're well, but this city is a battlefield.")
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', 'I have my own battles to fight, and you should do<br/>the same.')
('Feri', '...')
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', 'I have heard of your plans from Mr. Thorndyke.<br/>Take care, then.')
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', "I'll inform you if I learn anything of value.")
('Risette', 'Understood. Please take care as well.')
('Shizuna', "Oh, well. There wouldn't be much point in trying to<br/>stop you, anyway.")
('Harwood', 'Heh. Same to you.')
('Fie', 'I was hoping we could at least get a little bit of info<br/>out of you before you waltzed off.')
('Harwood', 'Heh. Sorry, Sylphid.')
('Cao', 'I had hoped we would be able to take the time to<br/>exchange information before parting, but alas.')
('Harwood', "That would've been nice, but it'll have to wait for<br/>another time, I'm afraid.")
('Harwood', "I'm looking forward to seeing how you get through<br/>this, Arkride.")
('Harwood', "That reward alone is enough to justify Almata's<br/>leaders returning from Gehenna.")
('Van', '...What?')
('Van', "Cocky old bastard just had to throw us a bone to<br/>chew on, didn't he?")
('Feri', 'Kasim...')
('Risette', "Either way, it appears we can't count on them for any<br/>further assistance.")
('Shizuna', "That's the society for you.")
('Fie', '(...Hmm?)')
('Cao', 'I would expect no less of the infamous Oathbreaker.')
('Bermotti', "*sigh* His face is my type, but he's also living proof<br/>that it's possible to be TOO much of a bad boy.")
('Bermotti', 'Now that chief of security, on the other hand, is just<br/>plain dreamy. ❤')
('Syd', "This isn't the time, Bermotti! We have to—agh...")
('Bermotti', 'Come now! I told you to try and stay calm until your<br/>wounds have healed.')
('Bermotti', 'Come on inside, everyone.')
('Bermotti', "I'll try to fill you in on everything that's been<br/>happening here.")
('System', 'They entered the café and bar, and Bermotti talked<br/>them through what he knew about the situation.')
('System', 'His experience mirrored their own—a strange call<br/>followed by the city and sky changing ominously, and<br/>most people being frozen in time.')
('System', 'They entered the café and bar, and Bermotti talked<br/>them through what he knew about the situation.')
('System', 'He also told them about what happened to Aaron.')
('Van', 'So René happened to be here right when it all<br/>happened, huh?')
('Bermotti', "That's right. You might already know this, but when<br/>the chaos began, a strange sphere appeared with it.")
('Bermotti', "It's disappeared since, but it seems like that little ball<br/>is the cause of a lot of our problems.")
('Syd', 'A-As soon as he found out, Aaron set off with the<br/>guy in the glasses to go look into it.')
('Eastern Young Woman', "I really hope he's okay... Something seemed to be<br/>weighing hard on him.")
('Eastern Young Adult', 'Yeah. He had the same eyes he did when Sei and<br/>Huang were killed.')
('Van', '...')
('Feri', 'Aaron...')
('Risette', 'That is rather concerning...')
('Shizuna', "Still, if he had that presidential aide from the CID<br/>with him, I'm sure he's fine.")
('Shizuna', 'We should go and have a look at this strange<br/>sphere, though.')
('Fie', "Still, if he had that presidential aide from the CID<br/>with him, I'm sure he's fine.")
('Fie', 'We should still go and check on them, though—and<br/>help to destroy the sphere.')
('Cao', "I suspect we have nothing to worry about. He's a<br/>strong young man, and he has that presidential aide<br/>from the CID with him.")
('Cao', "Still, I'm sure our support would be appreciated.")
('Van', "Can see 'em saying they didn't need it, though.")
('Van', "But I guess they'll just have to owe us one.")
('Van', "Anyway, we'll go check things out. In the meantime,<br/>see if you can get in touch with anyone else.")
('Bermotti', "No problem. I'll see if I can find some way we haven't<br/>thought of yet.")
('Syd', 'Thanks, everyone. Please take care of Aaron!')
('Feri', "He's our friend, too. We'll do everything we can to<br/>bring him back!")
('Risette', 'We will not let you down.')
('Syd', 'The mists are clearing!')
('Bermotti', 'They must have done it! What a relief.')
('System', 'They returned to the café and bar to both report back<br/>to Bermotti and to discuss their next move.')
('Syd', "I'm so glad you're all right, Aaron! If we'd lost<br/>you, too...")
('Aaron', "Hah. There ain't anything in the world strong enough<br/>to take ME out.")
('Aaron', "Glad you're doin' good, too, man.")
('Eastern Young Woman', 'I bet you are. You completely lost it when Syd<br/>was hurt.')
('Eastern Young Adult', "Haha. Yep, the ol' prodigy of Langport hasn't<br/>changed a bit.")
('Aaron', 'Aww, whatever! Knock it off with that shit!')
('Bermotti', "Haha... I'm glad you were all able to meet up again,<br/>either way.")
('Van', "Same here. We'd better get going, though. We still<br/>have other places we need to check out.")
('Van', 'Old Town and Central Station, in particular...')
('Van', "Feri's in one place, and Risette's in the other...<br/>I'm sure they're both fine, though.")
('Aaron', "Heh. Yeah, goes without saying the maid's tough, but<br/>Feri's proven herself in battle plenty of times<br/>already, too.")
('Kincaid', 'Hmm... Either way, perhaps it would be worth me<br/>joining you for a while.')
('Kincaid', 'I want to assess the situation in the other districts<br/>as well.')
('Van', "We've been around all the major districts in this part<br/>of the city now.")
('Van', "Think it's about time we made our way to the north<br/>side of the city.")
('Kincaid', 'Hmm... In that case, allow me to accompany you for<br/>a while.')
('Kincaid', "I want to assess the situation in the city's other<br/>districts as well.")
('Van', "The area around Central Station's the only district in<br/>this part of town that we haven't visited yet.")
('Van', "Risette was in charge of that area. I'm sure she's<br/>fine, though.")
('Feri', "I don't doubt it for a moment!")
('Aaron', "Yeah, that chick's tough as a tank.")
('Kincaid', 'Hmm... In that case, allow me to accompany you for<br/>a while.')
('Kincaid', "I want to assess the situation in the city's other<br/>districts as well.")
('Van', "Old Town is the only district in this part of town that<br/>we haven't visited yet.")
('Van', "Feri was in charge of that area. I'm sure she's<br/>fine, though.")
('Risette', 'As am I.')
('Aaron', "Yeah. She's proven herself at this point.")
('Kincaid', 'Hmm... In that case, allow me to accompany you for<br/>a while.')
('Kincaid', "I want to assess the situation in the city's other<br/>districts as well.")
('Bermotti', "That's a shame... I was rather hoping you'd stay.")
('Bermotti', 'Especially since the other two wasted no time<br/>in leaving.')
('Kincaid', 'I will arrange for this area to be protected as soon as I<br/>can establish contact with those who can provide it.')
('Kincaid', 'Though I suspect Marduk has already set the wheels<br/>in motion on that front.')
('Van', "Wouldn't be surprised. That chief of security never<br/>misses a beat.")
('Feri', "No kidding. I really wonder just how much he's been<br/>preparing for this.")
('Risette', "Indeed. I wouldn't be at all shocked if both he and<br/>our general manager had seen this crisis coming to<br/>some degree.")
('Shizuna', "Yes. The situation's still dire, but maybe there's a ray<br/>of hope on the horizon.")
('Shizuna', "Still, if our friend from the CID is going with you, I<br/>think you'll be fine without me. I'm gonna head off<br/>on my own.")
('Van', "Makes sense. Thanks for all the help you've given us.")
('Shizuna', 'Not at all. Hanging out with you helped me get a<br/>better handle on the situation, so it worked out for<br/>both of us.')
('Shizuna', "I'm going to meet up with Kurogane and the others,<br/>so if we learn anything, we'll give you a heads up.")
('Shizuna', 'See you around.')
('Fie', "Well, things are still pretty tense, but maybe there's<br/>finally a ray of hope shining through.")
('Fie', "I think you've got enough of a team if you've got<br/>Mister CID with you, so I'll go investigate<br/>somewhere else.")
('Van', "Makes sense. You're part of the guild, after all.")
('Van', "'Preciate the help, though. If we learn anything,<br/>we'll be sure to let you know.")
('Feri', 'Thank you so much for all your help!')
('Fie', 'Yeah, same to you.')
('Fie', "As soon as I find Elaine, I'll be sure to let her know<br/>you're all right.")
('Van', 'Thanks.')
('Kincaid', 'Haha...')
('Cao', 'Heh. The situation is still dire, but there appears to<br/>be a ray of hope at last.')
('Cao', "Regardless, if our friend from the CID will<br/>accompany you, I suppose it's about time I took<br/>my leave.")
('Van', 'You probably got a lot of other stuff to take care<br/>of, huh? I get it.')
('Cao', 'Thank you for your understanding.')
('Cao', 'Well, excuse me, then—and do take care of<br/>yourself, Aaron.')
('Aaron', 'Pfft. Same to you.')
('System', 'Aaron rejoined the party.')
('System', "Kincaid joined as a guest in Shizuna's place.")
('System', "Kincaid joined as a guest in Fie's place.")
('System', "Kincaid joined as a guest in Cao's place.")
('System', "Kincaid joined as a guest in Fie's place.")
('System', "Kincaid joined as a guest in Cao's place.")
('System', 'To advance the main story, inspect the car and select<br/>the next destination.')
('Kincaid', 'Incidentally, I have a suggestion about your plan to<br/>travel north through the center of the city.')
('Kincaid', 'There was heavy traffic on the capital expressway<br/>when the crisis struck, so it might be difficult to get<br/>there by car.')
('Van', 'Bah. Really?')
('Aaron', 'Makes sense, but damn, that sucks.')
('Risette', 'We could likely still make the journey if we used back<br/>roads and the like, but it would be much slower.')
('Feri', "Isn't there another route that we could take?")
('Kincaid', 'I was about to suggest one, actually. What say you to<br/>taking a detour through the Blacklight District?')
('Kincaid', 'Not only would it give us a route, but a lot of strong<br/>individuals tend to hang out around there. It could<br/>give us extra strength going forward.')
('Van', "That's not a bad idea, actually.")
('Van', "I think my master was there, too. It'd be a huge help<br/>to have him with us.")
('Aaron', 'Yeah, he is one damn strong dude.')
('Risette', 'We may be able to resupply there as well.')
('Van', "Then it's settled. The entrance we want is on the<br/>other side of the river.")
('Van', "But there's no way to be sure the route there'll be safe,<br/>so better make sure we're prepared before headin' off.")
('Feri', 'Roger that!')
('Kincaid', "Then let's make our move.")
('System', 'To advance the main story, go to the underground<br/>entrance in the northern part of Riverside.')
('Van', '(Hmm... Now where should we go next?)')
('System', 'Once a district has been selected, the others will be<br/>temporarily unavailable.')
('Van', "(Ferida was the one stationed in this district.<br/>I'm guessin' she's still there, too.)")
('Van', '(Time to go find her!)')
('Van', "(Risette was the one stationed in this district.<br/>I'm guessin' she's still there, too.)")
('Van', '(Time to go find her!)')
('Fie', "Here we are. I've used this entrance to the Blacklight<br/>District a few times myself.")
('Kincaid', "This is the entrance to the Blacklight District that<br/>you mentioned, I take it? I was aware there was one<br/>here, but I've never used it.")
('Cao', "This is the entrance to the Blacklight District that<br/>you mentioned, I assume? I've never used this<br/>particular one.")
('Aaron', "Makes sense you'd know about it.")
('Feri', "I'm really worried about the others. Let's get going!")
('Feri', "We don't have a second to waste.")
('Van', '...')
('Risette', '...What is it?')
('Feri', 'I-Is something wrong?')
('Van', 'Well...')
('Van', "Let me put it this way: I'm gettin' some real bad vibes<br/>about whatever's on the other side of this door.")
('Van', "I'd be willin' to bet there's at least a few monsters<br/>roamin' around somewhere in here.")
('Aaron', 'Well, shit.')
('Fie', "I'm guessing I'm not allowed to ask just how you<br/>know that?")
('Van', 'Yeah. Sorry.')
('Kincaid', 'I see. We should be prepared for combat before we go<br/>inside, then.')
('Van', "It's like you can read my mind.")
('Cao', "Hmm... Seems rather...unusual, but I won't<br/>question it.")
('Van', 'Thanks.')
('Risette', 'Then we should be certain we are fully prepared<br/>before moving on.')
('Feri', 'R-Right...')
('Aaron', '...')
('Van', "Huh. It's a transportation job.")
('Agnès', "That's...odd. Do you get these kinds of<br/>requests often?")
('Van', "Not really. You'd usually get a courier for this kinda<br/>job, and I'm that ain't exactly my job description.")
('Van', "Guaranteed that's not all there is to this.")
('Agnès', 'Right.')
('Van', "Well, whatever. Makes for a perfect first job<br/>with you. Let's book it to Central Station.")
('Van', "There's still a lingering scent. Gotta check the other<br/>bulletin boards.")
('Van', "I ain't pickin' up the usual scent, so I think the<br/>bulletin board hunt's over.")
('Agnès', 'That means we have two tasks to take care of today.')
('Van', 'We should get at least one of them settled today.')
('Van', 'We can take care of the other request if we got the<br/>time and energy,')
('Feri', "Okay! Let's get back to it, then!")
('Van', 'Well, might as well get this over with.')
('Van', "Let's go chat with our client after we wrap up here.")
(40351, 'Finally found ya, buddy... You the smuggler?')
(40351, 'Just keep calm and hand over the case. That way, no<br/>one gets hurt, yeah?')
(40352, "Better do what we say, or the li'l miss here's gonna<br/>get it. Would be a shame if she ends up in<br/>a hospital.")
('Van', 'Guess you finally showed yourselves, huh?')
('Van', "Nothin' personal, y'all. Just doin' my job here.")
('Van', 'But how about we take care of business elsewhere?<br/>Little cramped here for a beatdown.')
('Van', "Hope you're ready, Agnès.")
('Agnès', "Yes! I'm ready whenever!")
(40351, "The hell's up with you?! Cocky bastard!")
(40352, "You're gonna regret givin' us lip!")
(40351, '*pant* *pant* W-We lost?!')
(40352, "Man, we didn't even stand a chance...")
('Van', "I got time to kill if you two are up for round<br/>two, y'know.")
('Van', "Hate soundin' just like you two punks, but I'll<br/>definitely be sendin' you to the hospital if you keep<br/>this up.")
(40351, "Damn it! We'd be in for some big mira if we could<br/>just grab the goods!")
(40352, "Screw it! It ain't worth it, man. Let's just scram.")
('Agnès', 'Well... At least the package is still safe. That should<br/>hopefully be it.')
('Van', "Yeah, looks like it. Wasn't sure who we'd come<br/>across, but I guess I was worryin' over nothin'.")
('Doctor Isabelle', "Wouldn't say nothing. You're just too strong.")
('Doctor Isabelle', 'Those two actually have quite the reputation for<br/>knowing how to put up a fight.')
('Van', 'Hope you enjoyed the show, at least. ...Oh, huh.<br/>First time we meet face to face.')
('Agnès', 'You know her?')
('Doctor Isabelle', "A pleasure. I'm Isabelle, and I'm the client who<br/>posted your request.")
('Doctor Isabelle', 'Figured I should at least pick up the goods in person.')
('Doctor Isabelle', 'Even if it meant digging myself out of my dark and<br/>comfortable hole and coming out into the sun for<br/>a while.')
('Van', "Okay, then. Here's your stuff.")
('Doctor Isabelle', 'Yep, this is it. Good work.')
('Doctor Isabelle', 'This should be just what my patient needs.')
('Agnès', "Patient? You mean there's medicine there?")
('Doctor Isabelle', "That's what I mean, yeah.")
('Doctor Isabelle', "You can probably tell, but I'm a doctor. Not the<br/>regular kind, though. Think more back-alley.")
('Doctor Isabelle', 'I take all kinds of jobs, as long as the mira, the client,<br/>and the mood is right.')
('Doctor Isabelle', "My current patient's a kid with an incurable disease.<br/>It's rare to see it in the Republic.")
('Doctor Isabelle', 'Needed some medication for it that was only recently<br/>approved in Remiferia.')
('Agnès', 'Foreign medication, then.')
('Agnès', "It wouldn't have been approved in the Republic yet,<br/>then, if it's still new even in Remiferia.")
('Van', 'Still technically illegal, so you gotta handle it on the<br/>down low.')
('Van', 'And since I guess a particular someone was busy, you<br/>put in the request for us to handle it.')
('Doctor Isabelle', 'Quick on the uptake as ever. I appreciate that.')
('Doctor Isabelle', "Getting this medication all the way from Remiferia's<br/>a real hassle, let me tell you.")
('Doctor Isabelle', "At least funding's not really an issue here, since the<br/>kid's parents are rich.")
('Agnès', 'I see...')
('Van', "But you sprung a leak somewhere, yeah? And that's<br/>how those two knew 'bout it.")
('Van', 'Probably wanted to hold the meds hostage so they<br/>could fleece the parents for a good chunk of mira.')
('Van', "You definitely need to run a tighter ship if you don't<br/>want the whole world to know what you're up to.")
('Doctor Isabelle', 'Heh. Harsh, but true. I can see that, especially<br/>after this.')
('Doctor Isabelle', "If you don't mind, then, I'll be getting back to<br/>my patient.")
('Doctor Isabelle', "And don't worry about the payment. I'll be sure to get<br/>it to you.")
('Doctor Isabelle', "Let's hope we can meet again, you two.")
('Van', 'Later.')
('Agnès', "Isabelle's a black market doctor, then.")
('Agnès', "She looks like she's quite reasonable, still.")
('Van', "Yeah, she is. Was nice gettin' to meet her.")
('Van', "All right. Let's get goin'.")
('Agnès', 'Of course. Well done on this job, Van.')
('Agnès', '(I wonder where Isabelle treats her patients...)')
('Agnès', "(She said something about a dark hole, right? Odd.<br/>They also talked about a 'certain someone.'<br/>Wonder who that could be...)")
('Agnès', "(There's so much I still don't know. Feels like I'm just<br/>scratching the surface.)")
('System', 'Quest Attaché Case Delivery completed!')
('System', 'Received')
('Van', "You're Jonas, right? I'm the spriggan<br/>you requested.")
('Jonas', 'Oh!')
('Jonas', "That's right. It's a pleasure to meet you. I have a lot to<br/>talk about, so please take a seat.")
('Van', "Before we start, I wanna clear somethin' up.")
('Van', "This is the kinda job you can ask a bracer for<br/>help with. Why'd you pick us, then?")
('Jonas', "Haha, that's a fair question, indeed.")
('Jonas', "It's a long and complicated story, actually. Let<br/>me explain.")
('Agnès', 'Please do.')
('Jonas', 'Ahem. So then...')
('Jonas', "It started with my parents' divorce when I was young.<br/>I went with my father, and my younger sister was<br/>taken by my mother.")
('Jonas', 'That was ten years ago. Recently, my father passed<br/>away due to illness.')
('Jonas', 'While I was going through his belongings, I found,<br/>shockingly, a will addressed to my sister and<br/>my mother.')
('Jonas', "I guess even when you try to cut ties with them, you<br/>can't just erase family. And, well, I'd like to make sure<br/>that this will reaches them.")
('Feri', 'Oh, I understand. Yeah, finding them would<br/>be important.')
('Agnès', 'But again, why us? Why not go to a bracer about this?')
('Jonas', "Here's the issue. Amongst the papers, I found what I<br/>believe is a court order from the same service as<br/>the divorce.")
('Jonas', 'It indicated that neither parent could interact or<br/>interfere with the other.')
('Jonas', "I think that handing this will to my mother would<br/>technically violate that. If anything, I can't imagine<br/>she'd be happy about it.")
('Jonas', "I figured it might be a better idea to give it to my<br/>sister, then. Which is why I've been looking for her.")
('Jonas', "Also, since it's not urgent, I figured the guild would<br/>probably put me on the backburner and I'd end up<br/>waiting for who knows how long.")
('Van', "Got'cha.")
('Van', 'Yeah, I can see not wanting to end up a long-term<br/>resident of their mission board. Sure, we can handle<br/>this job.')
('Van', 'But anyway. Got any clues where to start?')
('Jonas', 'Not exactly... But I did find this letter with the will.')
('Jonas', "It was a letter from my grandmother on my mother's<br/>side from two years ago. Addressed to my father.")
('Jonas', 'In it she wrote that everyone on that side of the family<br/>was doing well, and attached to it was a picture of<br/>my sister.')
('Jonas', 'There was no address on the envelope, but the photo<br/>might be a good place to start.')
('Agnès', 'Can we see this photograph?')
('Jonas', 'Of course. Here it is.')
('Feri', "Oooh! She's so pretty!")
('Jonas', "Haha, right? It's hard to believe we're related.")
('Jonas', "Her name's Jessica. She's younger than I am, but she's<br/>my sister.")
('Jonas', 'The photo looks like it was taken in the<br/>Tyrell District.')
('Jonas', "I've gone and walked around there, hoping I might<br/>bump into her, but no luck.")
('Agnès', 'That feels like the perfect place to start our<br/>search, then.')
('Van', 'Good as any.')
('Van', '(All right. We should definitely take our time on<br/>this one.)')
('Van', '(Should I take the job right now?)')
('Jonas', "I'd like you to find my younger sister, starting your<br/>search in the Tyrell District.")
('Jonas', 'I have a picture of her if that helps you.<br/>Do you think you can take the job?')
('Van', '(Okay, do I take the job?)')
('Van', "Sorry. We're kinda busy at the moment.")
('Van', 'Mind if we handle everything else before we take<br/>your job?')
('Jonas', 'Oh, okay... It is what it is.')
('Jonas', 'I can wait as long as you need.')
('Van', "All right. I'll get started ASAP.")
('Van', 'Mind if I borrow the photo? Will be easier to ask<br/>around if I got it in hand.')
('Jonas', 'Of course, of course! Thank you.')
('Agnès', "Okay, then let's head to the Tyrell District.")
('Jonas', 'Oh! One last thing, if you would!')
('Van', 'Yeah?')
('Jonas', "Ah, well... If you do find my sister, please don't<br/>approach her.")
('Jonas', 'I mean, this might be the first time she hears about<br/>family she might not even know she had.')
('Jonas', "I'd rather she didn't hear about it from a spriggan,<br/>no offense. I'd just like to talk to her myself.")
('Van', 'Hmm...')
('Agnès', "I understand. Your reunion's a delicate matter and<br/>should be treated as such.")
('Feri', 'Okay! So we just need to locate her, then!')
('Jonas', 'Thank you so much. Please find my sister for me!')
('System', "Received photo of Jonas' sister.")
('System', 'Quest Missing Sister started!')
('Jonas', 'I must say, you do excellent work, spriggan.')
('Jonas', "You're really quick! I was expecting results, but not<br/>this quickly!")
('Jonas', "Now, let's cut to the chase? Where's my sister?")
('Van', "Yeah, about that... Just wanna ask somethin' before<br/>we give you a report.")
('Van', "I'll cut to the chase. You've been stalkin'<br/>Jessica, right?")
('Jonas', 'Oh, my. Really? This is all just a misunderstanding.')
('Jonas', "I know I look suspicious, snooping around and asking<br/>for a woman's place of residence like this.")
('Jonas', "But I can assure you that I found that photograph<br/>amongst my father's possessions.")
('Jonas', 'Do you think I just found a picture of some random<br/>woman there?')
('Jonas', "I wouldn't quite call myself a stalker for wanting to<br/>find the woman in the photograph.")
('Agnès', "No. You're not related to Jessica.")
('Agnès', 'We spoke with Jessica directly, on top of verifying her<br/>family records with city hall.')
('Agnès', 'We also found out that Jessica moved recently<br/>because she was being stalked.')
('Van', 'Dug up quite a lotta dirt on you, too, buddy.')
('Van', "This ain't your first rodeo. You were stalkin' another<br/>woman in a different district, yeah?")
('Van', "Got arrested for it, too, but they didn't have enough<br/>evidence to throw you in the slammer.")
('Jonas', '...')
('Jonas', 'Heh... Hahaha!')
('Jonas', "I made it clear you weren't to approach her! Why did<br/>you have to get involved, hmm?")
('Jonas', "And what do you care if I'm a stalker or not?")
('Jonas', "You're a spriggan! Isn't this what you do? Take jobs<br/>for people like me?")
('Agnès', "That's not—!")
('Jonas', 'I apologize for lying to you, really.')
('Jonas', "It just felt like it would've made things easier for the<br/>both of us if I did.")
('Jonas', "To be clear, I don't plan on harming Jessica at all.<br/>Not even after I find out her address.")
('Jonas', "Things went poorly with the last woman, but...I am<br/>Jessica's family. Or rather, I will be. I'm destined to<br/>become her family.")
('Jonas', "I'm eagerly looking forward to doting on my dear,<br/>dear little sister.")
('Feri', '(Umm... This guy is being really creepy.)')
('Jonas', "I'll ask again: Will you tell me Jessica's address?")
('Jonas', 'You can name your price.')
('Agnès', 'Van...')
('Van', 'Well...')
('Van', 'On behalf of Arkride Solutions, the answer is no.')
('Van', 'Any sweets will taste sour if I buy them with your<br/>damn money!')
('Jonas', "D-Don't joke with me!")
('Jonas', 'Worthless! But fine. I thought something like this<br/>might happen!')
('Agnès', 'Ah!')
('Feri', 'Let me handle this!')
('Jonas', 'Agh... Let go! Damn you, brat!')
('Feri', 'Heehee, I finally got to do something!')
('Feri', "You can keep resisting, but I won't let go of you!")
('Agnès', "Sh-She moved so fast I couldn't even see her!")
('Van', 'Great job, Feri.')
('Feri', 'Thanks! So, what now? Do we beat some sense<br/>into him?')
('Van', "I know what I said earlier, but let's not. No need to<br/>get our hands dirty here.")
('Van', '(What should we do here, though?)')
('Van', "(We got enough evidence to throw him to the police<br/>and let 'em sort this one out.)")
('Van', "(But on the other hand, I've also got plenty of<br/>dirt on him. Could use it to scare him into never<br/>tryin' anything like this again.)")
('Van', "(I'll take it easy and make him the police's problem.)")
('Van', "(Dude's a real piece of work, but even a hardcore<br/>stalker like him can learn a good lesson spent in<br/>the slammer.)")
('Van', "Feri, keep him down. I'm gonna report him to<br/>the police.")
('Feri', 'Affirmative!')
('Van', "Again, I got solid evidence to your stalkin'.")
('Van', 'Ran a background check on you, too. You work for a<br/>real big-name company, yeah?')
('Van', "Wonder what they'll think when this goes public?<br/>Guess that's for me to wonder and for you to find out.")
('Jonas', "Argh! Stop pretending you're the good guy!<br/>You're also a man of the underworld!")
('Jonas', "Don't you steal Jessica from me! I LOVE<br/>YOU, JESSICAAA!")
('System', 'So Jonas, the original client, was taken away by the<br/>police under suspicion of stalking.')
('Van', "(Might be best to use what I've got and blackmail<br/>him myself.)")
('Van', "(I'd love to trust the cops on this one, but he might<br/>also get away with just a slap on the wrist.)")
('Van', "(Fat chance that'll fix anything, so I gotta take<br/>matters into my own hands.)")
('Van', 'Feri, keep him down. Him and I are gonna have a<br/>little chat.')
('Feri', 'Affirmative!')
('Van', "Again, I got solid evidence to your stalkin'.")
('Van', 'Ran a background check on you, too. You work for a<br/>real big-name company, yeah?')
('Van', "Tell you what: promise me you stay the hell away<br/>from her, and they don't gotta hear about this.")
('Van', "You so much as even think about breakin' that<br/>promise, though, and I'll break your life into pieces so<br/>tiny you'll never put it back together.")
('Van', 'Understood?')
('Jonas', 'Tch... You think you can threaten me? Go ahead, see<br/>if any of it matters!')
('Agnès', "That's a shame. I guess we should head back to the<br/>office and transfer all files regarding this case to<br/>our computer.")
('Agnès', "I'll start with compiling my recording of this<br/>conversation and all other documents we gathered.")
('Jonas', "What?! You didn't!")
('Agnès', "Of course I did. I can't be too careless in this line<br/>of work. But if you think I'm bluffing, you're more<br/>than welcome to find that out the hard way.")
('Jonas', '...O-Okay.')
('Jonas', "Please, I'm begging you! Don't send anything to<br/>my company. I'll stay away from Jessica, I swear!")
('Feri', "Hmm... I'm not sure we can trust what he says.")
('Jonas', "I-I'll sign a contract, if you need me to!")
('Jonas', "Y-You can even bring a witness! I promise I won't<br/>ever get close to her again!")
('Van', "Yeah, I'd like it in paper. And look, I just so happen<br/>to have a suitable contract on me already. Go me,<br/>bein' so well prepared.")
('System', "So, under Feri's watchful eye, Jonas' hands were freed<br/>to allow him to sign the contract.")
('System', 'He agreed to stop stalking people, and to never<br/>attempt to contact Jessica ever again.')
('Agnès', 'Are you okay, Jessica? You look pale...')
('Jessica', "Yes, I'm fine. Besides, I was the one who wanted to<br/>listen in on everything.")
('Jessica', 'Again, thank you so much, everyone.')
('Jessica', 'I feel like I can finally go back to feeling safe in my<br/>day-to-day life again.')
('Van', 'Hope you can take another trip back to that favorite<br/>café of yours.')
('Agnès', "You'll be heading to the police to provide testimony<br/>after this, correct?")
('Agnès', "I'm sorry if we caused more trouble for you this way.<br/>Please take care of yourself.")
('Van', "You got that contract now, so it should be all right.<br/>Think the guy's too chicken now to try anything<br/>ever again.")
('Van', "But we'll keep an eye on you for a bit longer still.<br/>Just to make sure you're safe.")
('Agnès', 'Yes. I hope this will help alleviate your concern.')
('Jessica', 'Goodness, that is reassuring.')
('Jessica', "Oh, right. I'll make sure to forward your fee later.")
('Jessica', 'Thanks again, you all. For everything.')
('Van', "Man, that one sure was a pain. I'm feelin' all stiff, but<br/>I know a löyly might fix me right back up.")
('Agnès', 'Haha... I suppose we could make a quick stop<br/>after this.')
('Feri', '...What a strange experience. Dumping your client<br/>that way is unthinkable for a jaeger.')
('Feri', "But knowing he's been dealt with makes me feel so<br/>much better!")
('Feri', 'I still have a lot to learn about how a spriggan works!')
('Van', 'Hah. Feel free to take notes if you gotta.')
('Agnès', "I agree with the sentiment. I've learned so much<br/>myself already.")
('Agnès', "All right, everyone! Let's keep it up and finish up all<br/>of our other tasks!")
('System', 'Quest Missing Sister completed!')
('System', 'Received')
('Agnès', 'So this is the taco stand from the flyer, right?')
('Van', "Yeah. Let's see if it's got a clue for this code.")
('Feri', "Wow, they all look really tasty! I can't decide what<br/>to buy!")
('Gordon', 'Haha. Hey there, girlie!')
('Gordon', "Menu's right here. Feel free to pick whatever catches<br/>your eye.")
('Van', "Well, whatever, might as well make an order while<br/>we're here.")
('Van', "...Wait! No freakin' way.")
('Agnès', "Hmm? Oh, you're right! So that's what it means!")
('Feri', 'Huh? Did you figure something out?')
('Agnès', 'I think the menu itself might be our key.')
('Agnès', "You'll find the answer if you use the portion after<br/>the 'No/.'")
('Feri', "On the menu?! I don't get it...")
('Van', 'Why not give it a try? Good chance as any.')
('Van', "It's really straightforward if you figure out the trick.")
('Feri', 'Oh, I see. Okay then!')
('Feri', "I don't like that I'm the only one who hasn't figured it<br/>out anyway! I'll give it a shot!")
('Feri', '(The menu is the key to decipher the code, then?)')
('Feri', "(What came after 'No/' was R4G6B7F7Z1P8S10.)")
('Feri', "(There's nine items on the menu...)")
('Feri', '(Red Hot Chili Taco, Green Onion Taco, and the<br/>Veggie Salad Taco.)')
('Feri', '(Beef & Garlic Taco, Cheesy Taco, and the Fiery<br/>Fish Taco.)')
('Feri', '(Zesty Lemon Chicken Taco, Pulled Pork Taco, and<br/>the Shrimp & Bean Taco.)')
('Feri', "(What's the solution?)")
('Feri', "I got it! It's Zesty Red Green Fiery Pulled<br/>Beef Shrimp!")
('Feri', 'You take the first word as indicated by the letters,<br/>then arrange them from lowest to highest number!')
('Van', "Nope, that's not it. Fun idea, though, and one hell of<br/>a secret menu item.")
('Agnès', "Try starting at the first letter in every item, then go<br/>down a number of letters equal to the number next to<br/>that menu item's first letter.")
('Feri', "I got it! It's a taco!")
('Feri', 'The obvious answer from looking at the menu is that<br/>everything on it is a taco!')
('Van', 'I mean... Yes? But also, no.')
('Agnès', "Here's a clue: try going letter-by-letter down each<br/>menu item by a certain amount.")
('Feri', "I got it! It's Horizon!")
('Feri', 'You start at the first letter and go down each item a<br/>number of letters equal to the number, and take<br/>that letter!')
('Van', "You got it. Good job nailin' it on the first try.")
('Agnès', 'Well done, Feri!')
('Feri', 'Heehee... That was easy!')
('Van', "Yeah, that's right.")
('Van', "Took you a bit, but you did good by figurin' it out.<br/>Especially for someone not used to this kinda work.")
('Feri', 'Heehee... I wish I got it on the first try, but<br/>thank you!')
('Agnès', 'Nicely done, Feri.')
('Van', "But Horizon, huh? Next step is figurin' out what<br/>that means.")
('Agnès', "The obvious answer would be 'the horizon,' but that<br/>may be taking things too literally.")
('Van', 'Can always just ask.')
('Van', 'Hey, mind if I ask a quick question?')
('Van', "What's the first thing that comes to mind if I say the<br/>word 'horizon'?")
('Gordon', 'Horizon? Hmm... Oh, I know!')
('Feri', 'Really?!')
('Agnès', 'What is it...?')
('Gordon', 'No big deal, really.')
('Gordon', "But first thing to pop into my head was the<br/>apartment building across the river. 'S called<br/>Horizon Heim.")
('Gordon', 'The landlord stops by every now and then for<br/>some tacos.')
('Gordon', "Hard to forget when they're always complainin' about<br/>all the vacancies in the building!")
('Van', 'Got it. Thanks for the hint.')
('Van', "(Giacomo might've heard the landlord complainin'<br/>about all the vacancies.)")
('Van', "(If he did, it'd make sense he'd take advantage of the<br/>empty space to hide stuff.)")
('Agnès', '(True. Shall we go look into it?)')
('Feri', "(Let's go!)")
('Agnès', '(Good idea...)')
('Agnès', "(Wait, there's still some other stops that Giacomo<br/>could've used as hiding spots we haven't checked yet.)")
('Agnès', '(It might be more efficient to check those spots first.)')
('Feri', "(Yeah. Let's go see this underground place in Station<br/>Street you mentioned!)")
('Van', 'So, this is Horizon Heim.')
('Agnès', "After all our clues, I think room 203's the<br/>most suspicious.")
('Agnès', 'Should we go inside it?')
('Van', "Was thinkin' about that, but I don't buy that the<br/>hidin' spot's the buildin' itself. It's too easy.")
('Van', "Giacomo was the careful type. Wouldn't have wanted<br/>people to see him comin' in and out of the building.")
('Feri', "Then it must be outside. But then what's the<br/>203 about?")
('Van', "Figure it's gotta be this, right?")
('Agnès', 'Oh, the mailbox!')
('Feri', 'Interesting. The drop slot for 203 is covered by a<br/>transparent tape.')
('Van', "Yeah, probably 'cause the room's not rented.")
('Van', 'However, the code suggests that inside our little<br/>post box...')
('System', 'Van tore the tape off the room 203 mailbox and took<br/>out the contents.')
('Van', 'Knew it. Here it is.')
('Feri', "So this is the notebook we've been searching for?")
('Agnès', 'A worn leather notebook... It certainly looks like it.')
('Van', "Yeah. This thing's filled with personal info, photos,<br/>and newspaper clippings about all kinds of folk.")
('Van', 'No question. This is the blackmail material Jess<br/>talked about.')
('Agnès', "Where's Jess' page? Ah... Here it is.")
(40000, 'Beneath a blue sky, as you and I sit, listening to my<br/>strings, it occurs to me that these everyday moments<br/>with you mean everything to me.')
(40000, 'From ever letting you know the truth of my feelings I<br/>shall abstain. More than just friendship, locked away<br/>in my heart they remain.')
(40000, 'Though they may overpower me, forever I shall be<br/>apart of the flowery man that owns my heart.')
('Agnès', 'Is this a poem? No... These are lyrics.')
('Agnès', "Oh, there's a comment. 'Taken from<br/>discarded notebook.'")
('Agnès', "These lyrics, though, they're...")
('Feri', "They're nice and all, but what about this makes them<br/>blackmail material?")
('Van', "There's a photo here, too.")
('System', "The photo shows Jess entering a business with a<br/>man's arm around his shoulder. His expression is<br/>guilty and full of shame.")
('Van', "At a glance it looks like he got suckered in by some<br/>shop's barker?")
('Feri', 'No, really. All of this looks normal. What about this<br/>is blackmail?')
('Agnès', "I'm not sure I'm right, but I may have an idea.")
('Agnès', '(Did you notice, Van? The song is talking about<br/>a man. Do you think that means...?)')
('Van', "(Yeah, we're thinkin' about the same thing.)")
('Feri', "Aww, come on! Don't whisper to each other! I wanna<br/>know what you're talking about!")
('Van', "We gotta run this by the client first. We don't got any<br/>proof anyway.")
('Van', "Let's meet up with him and have them look at the<br/>contents of this notebook.")
('Shino', 'Ah, Van! Do you have a moment?')
('Van', "I guess? What's up?")
('Shino', 'One of my customers left this behind.')
('Van', "Whoa! That bag's from Andalucía!")
('Van', 'Damn. What kinda rude customer just up and leaves<br/>one of their masterpieces behind?')
('Shino', "Haha. I see your sweet tooth hasn't rotted out your<br/>mouth yet, Van.")
('Shino', "But back to business, this isn't your normal lost item.<br/>There's a story to it.")
('Shino', 'I was honestly planning on contacting the guild or<br/>the police.')
('Shino', 'But in you stroll at the perfect time. Would you mind<br/>if I request for you to handle this?')
('Van', 'This Andalucía bag has a story, huh?')
('Van', "That's weird, but I trust you here. It must be<br/>real serious.")
('Van', "(Gotta admit, I'm curious. But should I get involved?)")
('Shino', 'A customer forgot an item here... One with a story.')
('Shino', 'I was honestly planning on contacting the guild or<br/>the police.')
('Shino', 'But in you stroll at the perfect time. Would you mind<br/>if I request for you to handle this?')
('Van', "(I don't know the details, but I'm curious. Should I<br/>get involved?)")
('Van', "We're hardly strangers, Shino. I'd love to help.")
('Van', "But I'm in a bit of a hurry right now.")
('Shino', 'I understand. Sorry for holding you up.')
('Shino', "But I'd appreciate your help if you can find the time.")
('Van', "Sure. I'll take that job.")
('Shino', "That's a relief. Thank you.")
('Van', 'So, mind if I peek inside the bag?')
('Van', "With the way you're talkin' about it, it can't be a cake.")
('Shino', 'Of course. Take a look.')
('System', 'Van took out the contents of the bag.')
('Van', "Man, oh, man... There's a story here, all right.")
('Van', "By the way this thing was bagged up, I'm guessin'<br/>it came from some smuggling route?")
('Shino', 'Good question. Frankly, the owner seemed like your<br/>average everyman, suit and all.')
('Shino', "He didn't strike me as a shady character.")
('Shino', 'My biggest impression of him was probably that he<br/>seemed worn down. He was definitely drowning<br/>his worries.')
('Van', "Drownin' his worries with a gun in a bag.<br/>Yeah, where this is goin' ain't pretty.")
('Van', 'Last you know is he got drunk and left this behind?')
('Shino', "That's as much as I know on my end.")
('Shino', 'He left my truck just a bit ago, actually.')
('Shino', "He mentioned something about 'catching one last live<br/>performance,' I think.")
('Shino', "If you're quick, you should be able to catch up to him.")
('Van', "All right. That's a good enough lead to start at.<br/>I'll head to the concert hall.")
('Van', "I'll bring the goods with me, just in case.")
('Shino', "Naturally. I'll leave this customer in your hands<br/>then, Van.")
('System', 'Quest What Once Was Lost started!')
('Van', 'Okay, so, here we are. Right at the entrance to the<br/>Riverside subway.')
('Van', "It said 'Look to the river' and 'where a metal box<br/>ferries passengers underground.'")
('Van', "That's gotta mean here.")
('Agnès', "Let's go underground, then.")
('Agnès', "'The man watching over it holds the key.'")
('Feri', "Let's go underground, then.")
('Feri', "The next key's with the man that watches over the<br/>metal boxes.")
('Aaron', "Okay, let's head down underground.")
('Aaron', "Next key's being held by the man that watches over<br/>the 'metal boxes,' yeah?")
('Van', 'Yeah.')
('Van', "The next riddle said to 'look to the river, where a<br/>metal box ferries passengers underground.'")
('Van', "Should we head down and find the man watchin' over<br/>these boxes?")
('Van', 'Hey there, old man. You Bruno?')
('Bruno', '...Who are you?')
('Van', "A spriggan looking for work. I'm with<br/>Arkride Solutions.")
('Van', 'Mind if we talk about the job?')
('Bruno', "The job's exactly as I described in the posting.")
('Bruno', "I'm getting old, so I figured it was about time for me<br/>to sort things out before I pass on.")
('Bruno', 'I want you to get this thing back to its proper owner.')
('System', 'Bruno drew an item out from his pocket.')
('Van', 'A locket?')
('Agnès', "This photo... This isn't yours, right?")
('Feri', "Wait, this photo is of someone else, isn't it?")
('Aaron', "Okay, but this isn't your photo, right, old man?")
('Bruno', "That's right. This locket belongs to a stranger.")
('Bruno', 'I used to make my living as a thief, long ago. I<br/>stole this.')
('Bruno', "Just to be clear, I don't do that anymore. Life's taken<br/>its turns for me.")
('Van', "I've actually heard about you, Bruno.")
('Van', "You were a pretty famous thief. Rumor has it no lock<br/>had been invented you couldn't break into.")
('Van', "Though all the legends are from when you were<br/>young, so everyone thought you'd given it up. I guess<br/>the rumor was true.")
('Bruno', "Oh, you know me? You could've said so before I<br/>bothered explaining, then.")
('Bruno', "But whatever. It's been twenty years since I stole<br/>this locket.")
('Bruno', "It ain't the kinda thing you'd get good money out of,<br/>so I kept it with me instead of selling it.")
('Bruno', "After hearing some rumors about you, spriggan, I<br/>figured it'd be better to see if you can return it for me<br/>before I just pitch it in the trash.")
('Bruno', 'So? How about it? Will you take the job?')
('Bruno', 'I want you to return this stolen locket to its owner.')
('Bruno', 'So, will you take the job?')
('Van', "That certainly is up my wheelhouse, but mind givin'<br/>me a bit?")
('Bruno', "Hmm? Well, I can't force you. I'll stay here, but don't<br/>keep me waiting.")
('Van', "Sure, we'll take the job.")
('Van', 'Obvious question, but do you know where the<br/>owner is?')
('Bruno', 'I want you to return the locket to the boy in<br/>the photograph.')
('Bruno', "Of course, it's been twenty years, so I'm sure he's that<br/>much older by now.")
('Agnès', 'I suppose he would be in his late twenties by now.')
('Agnès', 'Would you happen to know where he is now?')
('Feri', "Okay, so that'd make him in his late twenties.")
('Feri', 'So, where is he?')
('Aaron', "Right, so he's in his late twenties now.")
('Aaron', "So, where's our guy?")
('Bruno', 'How should I know? Finding that out is your job.')
('Van', "Can't even throw me a bone here?")
('Bruno', "I stole it when I was hitting the Maserati Hotel's<br/>guest rooms over in Seiden.")
('Bruno', 'It was quite the event at the time, from what I hear.<br/>The hotel staff might know more about it, so try<br/>asking them.')
('Agnès', 'We should find a member of the hotel staff who<br/>might know about the events that took place then.')
('Feri', "Okay, so we should find hotel staff who might know<br/>about the hotel's history?")
('Aaron', "Right. We're looking for hotel staff who know about<br/>their history.")
('Bruno', 'I assume you can handle it from there.')
('Bruno', "Let me know once you've returned it. I'll send over<br/>your payment then.")
('Van', '...There he goes.')
('Van', 'I guess our next stop is the hotel in Seiden.')
('Van', "Let's go look into this.")
('Agnès', 'Yes!')
('Feri', 'Understood!')
('Aaron', 'Sure, got it.')
('System', 'Quest Change of Heart started!')
('Bruno', 'I was hoping to hear from you, spriggan.')
('Bruno', "But I figured it wouldn't be until you'd returned<br/>the locket. What's this about?")
('Van', "First off, I wanna make sure we're on the same page.<br/>Let me give you a progress report on<br/>our investigation.")
('Bruno', "All right then. Let's hear it.")
('System', "Van explained what they'd learned about the terrorist<br/>attack on the Maserati Hotel.")
('System', "Finally, they told Bruno they'd managed to get in<br/>contact with Senator Taylor's son, Roderick.")
('Bruno', 'Well, well. You certainly picked up the trail quick.')
('Van', 'You said you robbed the hotel, but this photo is of<br/>two of the terrorist attack victims.')
('Van', "Thought you might've been the terrorist behind the<br/>attack, but I've changed my mind since.")
('Van', 'My guess is you just...did exactly what you said.<br/>Robbed the hotel.')
('Van', 'Just so happened that you were in the middle of it<br/>when the place was hit by terrorists, yeah?')
('Bruno', 'Hmph. Those kinds of coincidences only occur<br/>in stories.')
('Bruno', "But that ridiculous scenario's exactly what happened<br/>that day.")
('Agnès', "It's the only thing that seemed plausible.")
('Agnès', "So the person that intervened and saved Roderick's<br/>life at the time would've been...")
('Feri', 'We heard it right, then.')
('Feri', "So then the someone that intervened and saved<br/>Roderick's life was...")
('Aaron', "Yep. Which also means that the person we heard<br/>about that saved Roderick's life must've been...")
('Bruno', "You make it sound more honorable than it was.<br/>I wasn't out to save a kid.")
('Bruno', "My mind wasn't on all the dead people at the time.<br/>I thought that, hey, with people dying all around me,<br/>no one would miss a thing or two.")
('Van', "Man, aren't you a nice fella. Guess the locket's one of<br/>those missing things.")
('Van', 'Even then, Roderick still wants to meet you.')
('Bruno', 'Wait, what?')
('Van', 'He asked us to bring you to him when we hand<br/>over the locket, actually.')
('Bruno', "That's ridiculous! How do you want me to face<br/>him now?!")
('Agnès', "Aren't you worried about him yourself, Bruno?")
('Agnès', 'You want to know how the child from back then<br/>is doing.')
('Agnès', "Otherwise, you wouldn't have asked us to give the<br/>locket back to him.")
('Feri', "But you're worried about him, right?")
('Feri', "That's why you hired us to return the locket to the<br/>boy from back then.")
('Aaron', "Worry's written all over you, man.")
('Aaron', "You wanted to know what happened and whether the<br/>kid's still kicking.")
('Aaron', "And that's why you hired us to get the locket back<br/>to him.")
('Van', "If you ask me, you should stop skulkin' about and just<br/>talk to him.")
('Bruno', "Damn it. It's not that easy...")
('Van', '(He just needs one more push.)')
('Van', "(It'd be best if he was honest about bein' the guy that<br/>stole the locket.)")
('Van', "(But if he doesn't wanna, then maybe he could go<br/>under the guise of bein' someone else?)")
('Van', '(Best to stop with the lies and just present himself as<br/>the thief.)')
('Van', "Stop makin' excuses and do it, already!")
('Van', "I dunno what Roderick's out to get from this meetin'<br/>with you.")
('Van', "But the worst that can happen will be you reapin'<br/>what you've sown.")
('Bruno', '...')
('Bruno', "You're...right. If I'm going to go this far, I might as<br/>well have the courage to take that last step.")
('Van', "(Don't think he'll bite, but he might be inclined if<br/>he's pretendin' to be someone else.)")
('Van', "Look, if you really don't want to, fine.")
('Van', 'You can just pretend to be someone else other than<br/>the thief that stole the locket.')
('Bruno', 'How do you figure?')
('Van', "Whoever stole the locket that day, they're<br/>someone else. You just happened to buy this in a<br/>black market somewhere.")
('Van', "You saw the photo inside and figured it<br/>was important. That's why you decided to return<br/>the locket.")
('Van', "How 'bout it? Might be easier to meet up with him<br/>that way.")
('Bruno', '...')
('Bruno', "Okay. I'll go along with that, sure.")
('Van', "(What's a kid doin' out at this time? She ain't even<br/>got an umbrella on her.)")
('Van', "(Well, can't just ignore her. I'll see what's up.)")
('Van', "Hey, kiddo. What'cha doin' out this late without<br/>an umbrella?")
('Van', "Promise you that you ain't missing much by stickin'<br/>round this boring spot.")
('Lyla', '*sniffle* Mister...')
('Lyla', "Umm. My little sister and I were playing with each<br/>other's hair ties...")
('Lyla', "...but I dropped my sister's ties in the river and I just<br/>can't find them!")
('Van', "Ah, got'cha. Lost somethin' important, then.")
('Van', "But I don't think you're gonna find much at all when<br/>it's this dark out.")
('Van', "Take it on the chin for now and come back when<br/>it's daytime. And maybe when it's not rainin' so hard.")
('Van', "You'll catch a cold if you stick 'round.")
('Lyla', 'No! I have to find them right now!')
('Lyla', "I've been searching for them for so long... I've got<br/>to find them soon!")
('Van', "Good grief, you're a stubborn one. Reminds me of<br/>someone I know.")
('Van', '(I could just take her back home myself if I<br/>wanted to.)')
('Van', "(But I'm not too sure I can persuade her to leave.<br/>Might be easier to help her find the darned things.)")
('Lyla', "Umm, I'm looking for my sister's hair ties. We traded<br/>them for fun.")
('Lyla', "I've been searching for them for a long time now.<br/>I have to find them soon!")
('Van', '(Ah, hell... She is definitely not just gonna go home.<br/>Do I help her find the things?)')
('Van', "(I'm worried about her, but I've got other stuff to<br/>deal with.)")
('Van', "Look, kiddo. Just don't stick around too long, okay?")
('Van', "Don't wanna get seen by cops or caught up with some<br/>local thugs, yeah?")
('Lyla', "I'm not scared!")
('Lyla', 'But I have to find them, no matter what!')
('Van', '(Ah, geez...)')
('Van', "Okay, fine. Guess I got stuck with you since I made<br/>the mistake of askin' what was up.")
('Van', "I'll help you find those hair ties or whatever.")
('Lyla', "Really?! You're not kidding, mister?!")
('Van', "Yeah, but I don't work for free.")
('Van', "And I don't take money from kids, either, so I'm<br/>gonna cut you a deal instead.")
('Lyla', 'A-A deal?')
('Van', "If we can't find them, you accept it, give up on them<br/>for now, and come back another day.")
('Van', "If you don't agree to that, then no dice.")
('Lyla', 'Okay, I promise! Please help me look for them!')
('Van', "All right. A deal's a deal.")
('Van', "Let's hop to it. Where'd you drop the hair ties?")
('Lyla', 'Not here!')
('Lyla', 'The day I lost them, the river was so, SO full<br/>of water! And they got washed away!')
('Lyla', "They're this way! Follow me!")
('Van', 'Whoa! Wait up!')
('Van', "That's weird. The river hasn't flooded recently...")
('Van', "*sigh* But I guess I'm followin' her anyway.")
('Van', 'Ahh, fresh air at last.')
('Van', "And of course it's still rainin'.")
('Van', 'Hold on! Is she...?!')
('Van', 'Hey! You...')
("Laura's Daughter", 'Huh? Who are you, mister?')
('Van', "(Damn if she doesn't look exactly like the other girl.<br/>A little younger, maybe.)")
('Van', 'Sorry. Got the wrong person.')
('Laura', 'Wait a second. What are you holding there?')
('Van', 'Ah... I picked them up a bit ago.')
('Van', "Figured I might as well try and find their owner,<br/>so I was gonna start lookin'.")
('Laura', 'Oh! They look just like them!')
('Laura', 'Sorry, but could you tell me more about where you<br/>found those?')
('Van', 'Yeah, sure.')
('Laura', "Sorry for the inconvenience. I still haven't even<br/>introduced myself.")
('Laura', 'My name is Laura, and this is my daughter.')
("Laura's Daughter", 'Hi!')
('Van', "I'm Van from Arkride Solutions.")
('Van', 'Wait. You said your name is Laura?')
('Lyla', "Here! It's Laura's hair ties!")
('Lyla', "...and I lost them. It's my fault that Laura's been so<br/>sad this whole time.")
('Van', 'Do you recognize these?')
('Laura', "I do. That's what I wanted to talk about.")
('Laura', 'My twin sister, Lyla, lost them twenty years ago.')
('Laura', 'Today is the twentieth anniversary of her death.')
('Laura', 'This is where the accident happened. I came by to<br/>pay my respects, only to be surprised when I see you<br/>turn up with those in hand.')
('Van', 'That...is definitely a surprise, yeah.')
('Van', "(So me runnin' into that kid tonight wasn't<br/>a coincidence.)")
('Van', "What kind of accident was it? You don't have to<br/>answer that if you don't want to.")
('Laura', "Well, I don't think this encounter is a mere<br/>coincidence, so I'm okay sharing. It was twenty years<br/>ago, on a dark and cloudy day. Just like today.")
('Laura', 'My whole family had come to the capital for a trip,<br/>only to have the capital suddenly be struck by<br/>tremendous downpours.')
('Laura', "The river here didn't take long to be swollen<br/>with water.")
('Van', "(And that's the flooding the kid was talking about.)")
('Laura', 'Our family was rushing to evacuate, of course.')
('Laura', "But while we were doing that, my sister came back<br/>here because she'd dropped my hair ties.")
('Laura', 'I chased after her that day...')
('Laura', 'But the river swallowed us both.')
('Van', '...')
('Laura', "I survived by some miracle but she...wasn't so lucky.")
('Laura', 'The last memento of hers that we could never find<br/>were those hair ties you have in your hands.')
('Van', "I see. Thanks for sharin' with me.")
('Van', "I'll give these back to their rightful owner, then.")
('System', 'Van gave Laura the hair ties.')
('Laura', '*sniffle* Thank you so much...')
('Laura', "I can't believe I just happened to meet the person that<br/>would find them, twenty years later. This must be a<br/>miracle from the Goddess herself.")
("Laura's Daughter", "Hey, can I see them? They're a little dirty but<br/>they're really pretty!")
('Laura', 'Right? This is a precious treasure that belonged to my<br/>sister and I.')
('Laura', "They are a little dirty, but that should clean off.<br/>Once they're clean, I'll let you wear them.")
("Laura's Daughter", 'Really, really? Yay!')
("Laura's Daughter", "Heehee, they're so cute!")
("Laura's Daughter", 'Do they look good on me?')
('Laura', 'They definitely suit you.')
('Laura', '...')
('Van', 'You okay?')
('Laura', 'I apologize. Thank you for being considerate.')
('Laura', "I never stopped feeling guilty about that day. If I<br/>hadn't been so mad at her for losing the ties, she<br/>might still be alive today...")
('Laura', 'Wherever she is now, she must hate me.')
('Van', "It probably doesn't mean much, comin' from me...")
('Van', "...but I don't think your sister would hate you or hold<br/>a grudge.")
('Van', "In fact, I'm sure that she'd be more worried about<br/>getting them back to you so you wouldn't be sad.")
('Laura', '...')
('Laura', 'That...does sound like her, all right.')
('Laura', 'If she were here, I can imagine her trying to cheer<br/>me up.')
('Laura', "She was always so full of life, so kind. That's the sister<br/>I remember.")
("Laura's Daughter", 'Mommy, are you okay?')
('Laura', "*sniffle* I'm sorry, dear. I'm fine now.")
('Laura', "Van, right? I can't thank you enough.")
('Laura', "This doesn't feel like nearly enough, but please take it<br/>as a token of my gratitude.")
('System', 'Received <br/>.')
('Van', "I wasn't lookin' for payment or anything, but if you<br/>insist, I'll take it.")
('Laura', "I do. I hope it'll be useful to you.")
('Laura', 'Sorry for keeping you.')
('Laura', "We'll be heading off now. Once again... Thank you<br/>so much.")
("Laura's Daughter", 'Thanks for the pretty hair ties!')
('Van', 'Have a good one.')
('System', 'Quest Lost and Found completed!')
('Van', '(That looks like the person my client told me about.)')
('Van', "Hey there. You're Carson, yeah?")
('Van', 'Stephan told me to come to you.')
('Carson', "Oh, yes. So you know Walton's son, then.")
('Carson', "I'm Carson, yes.")
('Carson', "I'm pleased to know you have an interest in<br/>our activities.")
('Carson', 'Allow me to explain Libra Domina.')
('Van', 'Yeah, about that...')
('Van', "Was kinda hopin' we could hear all of this from<br/>Stephan's dad, you know? Walton, I mean.")
('Carson', 'I see... Unfortunately, Walton is currently busy with<br/>religious service.')
('Van', 'What kind of religious service?')
('Carson', "Ah, yes. Walton hasn't been able to make his tithes<br/>lately, I believe?")
('Carson', "He's helping out with services to the church. After all,<br/>tithes and good deeds both pave the road to a<br/>virtuous life.")
('Carson', 'So, if you would allow me to explain our faith to you,<br/>I will.')
('Carson', 'Do you wish to join the Libra Domina faith?')
('Agnès', "Well, I'm intrigued at least.")
('Carson', "Of course, I can imagine you'll need to experience the<br/>wonder of our beliefs first.")
('Carson', 'As it happens, though... You are in fact<br/>quite fortunate!')
('Carson', "You see, we're scheduled to soon hold the Ceremony<br/>of Purifying Scales!")
('Feri', "The...Ceremony of Purifying Scales? What's that?")
('Aaron', 'Run that one by me again?')
('Carson', "Well, to start with, I should make clear that the Libra<br/>in our faith's name is the same libra of the scales.<br/>All is made equal by scales.")
('Carson', 'Judgment is passed in the ceremony. Good shall be<br/>repaid with good, and evil shall be repaid in evil.')
('Van', "Uh-huh... So that's the particular flavor of your faith.")
('Risette', 'So then, what should happen when the scales tip?')
('Carson', 'Well, for those who have done much good, our guru<br/>will grant them a blessing.')
('Carson', "For one who's done little good...or one who's done<br/>too much evil, our religious leader hands down<br/>divine punishment.")
('Van', "Don't like the sound of that. What does this divine<br/>punishment of yours entail?")
('Carson', 'Should it be called for...they will be forced to even the<br/>scales with their own blood.')
('Agnès', 'W-Wait one moment... With their blood?<br/>How, exactly?')
('Carson', "Well, honestly... I'm not sure myself.")
('Carson', "After all, I've never done an evil deed in my life, so<br/>I'm not privy to the details.")
('Carson', 'You need not worry about it.')
('Carson', "As long as you earn your good deeds by preaching<br/>and tithing, you shouldn't have cause to meet such<br/>a fate.")
('Feri', '(Jaeger corps can be pretty hard on people who break<br/>the rules, too, but I dunno...)')
('Feri', "(This feels totally different. I don't like it.)")
('Aaron', "(Don't know what kind of divine punishment they<br/>have in mind, and I don't want to find out.)")
('Carson', 'Oh, come to think of it... Walton will probably be<br/>partaking in the gathering, too.')
('Carson', 'Busy as he might be with service, joining the ritual is<br/>the duty of all believers.')
('Van', "...Yeah. We'll take you up on that offer to see the<br/>ritual, then.")
('Van', 'Might be a good way to figure out if we wanna join<br/>your faith or not.')
('Carson', "Well, of course! I'm thrilled to hear you're interested.")
('Carson', 'The Ceremony of Purifying Scales should be starting<br/>momentarily, in fact.')
('Carson', 'The site is a sacred place, suitable for freeing and<br/>purifying the souls of the people.')
('Carson', "Riverside's concert hall, of course! Which we have<br/>reserved for our use.")
('Carson', "Now, if you don't mind, I'll head over there now so I<br/>can inform the receptionist that you'll be coming.")
('Van', 'Sure. Thanks.')
('Agnès', 'The Libra Domina feel more dangerous than I first<br/>thought they would be.')
('Agnès', "The silver lining is that it sounds like our client's<br/>father is still well.")
('Agnès', "I do hope we'll be able to find him at this meeting.")
('Van', "Nothin' we can do except roll with the punches.<br/>Did sound like everyone would turn up, though.")
('Van', "Y'all be careful while we're there.")
('Risette', 'Of course. A mistake could turn an entire room of<br/>disciples into enemies.')
('Feri', "Dunno what they were going on about, with the<br/>concert hall being 'sacred' or whatever...")
('Feri', "Anyway, let's stop these weirdos!")
('Aaron', "Let's get going to the concert hall, then.")
('Aaron', 'Bunch of weirdos, trying to sell the concert hall of all<br/>places as some sorta of holy ground.')
('Aaron', 'At least it should make things quick and easy.<br/>Should be done with those creeps quick enough.')
('Carson', "Hello again, everyone. I've been waiting for you.")
('Carson', "I've already spoken to the receptionist about your<br/>wish to observe our ceremony.")
('Carson', 'It will begin momentarily. Are you ready to join us?')
('Van', 'Sorry, just gimme a quick sec here.')
('Carson', 'Of course. The ceremony will begin momentarily,<br/>though, so please hurry.')
('Van', "Yeah, we're good. Show us in.")
('Carson', 'Of course, come with me.')
('Young Man 1 (City; Alt Color Version 1)', 'Goddess Aidios! We offer our gratitude on this<br/>holy day!')
('Young Man 1 (City; Alt Color Version 1)', "I've done so many good deeds, I'm guaranteed<br/>a blessing!")
('Young Man 1 (City; Alt Color Version 1)', 'Glory to Libra Domina! Glory to Libra Domina!')
('Feri', "(I-I already kinda regret coming here... It's<br/>so...overwhelming.)")
('Aaron', '(Well, that went from zero to nuts real quick.)')
('Carson', "I'll excuse myself now.")
('Carson', 'May our guru bless you all.')
('Van', 'Yeah. Thanks.')
('Agnès', 'Goodness. They are certainly...passionate.')
('Van', "They sure are. Might be new and all, but I get the<br/>feelin' they're soon gonna be a big pain in the ass at<br/>this rate.")
('Van', "Honestly, I'd be out the door already, but we gotta<br/>find our client's father first.")
('Risette', "I believe I've located him. That man over there might<br/>be him.")
('Feri', 'Yes, he matches the description!')
('Aaron', 'Sure looks like our guy.')
('Van', "Good. That confirms that he's alive at least.")
('Van', 'What do we do now?')
('Guru', 'Everyone, let us offer up our prayers of gratitude for<br/>this day, guided by the scales.')
('Young Man 1 (City; Alt Color Version 1)', 'Oh, dear Aidios, Goddess of the Sky, we thank you<br/>for this day of salvation!')
('Guru', 'Very well, then. In the name of Aidios, I hereby<br/>proclaim the beginning of the Ceremony of<br/>Purifying Scales!')
('Guru', 'We shall correct the injustices that have been left<br/>untouched, for right and wrong, and purify our<br/>chaotic world.')
('Van', '(More like mindless drones than people here.)')
('Agnès', '(Should we follow along as well?)')
('Van', "(Nah. We're just observers, remember. Don't gotta<br/>do anything. Yet.)")
('Van', "(I get creeped the hell out anyway, just thinkin' about<br/>actin' like them.)")
('Feri', '(Me, too... I feel like even just imitating them would<br/>be an offense to Arusha.)')
('Aaron', '(For once, I agree with you.)')
('Guru', 'First, let us begin by rewarding those whose scales tip<br/>heavy with good deeds.')
('Guru', 'Followers Carson and Dolly, please step forward.')
('Guru', 'Your worthy tithes and deeds in attracting new<br/>followers have caught the eye of our Goddess.')
('Guru', 'Therefore, I grant you both the title of<br/>Honorary Evangelist. May you both be a role model<br/>for all followers of our faith.')
('Carson', "H-Honorary Evangelist! I'm hardly worthy of such a<br/>great honor!")
('Dolly', "*sniffle* I... I'll dedicate my whole life to proving<br/>myself worthy of such a title!")
('Agnès', "That's the same Carson we were speaking to<br/>before, yes? At least he looks happy, but with the<br/>donations and recruitments...")
('Van', 'It just feels like your classic pyramid scheme in here.')
('Guru', 'To continue forward, it is time to punish those whose<br/>scales tip heavy with evil deeds.')
('Guru', 'Follower Walton, and the two transgressors from the<br/>other day, please step up.')
('Risette', "There's Mr. Walton, but who does he mean<br/>by transgressors?")
('Van', "This is goin' from bad to worse.")
('Guru', 'First, the transgressors...')
('Guru', 'Though followers of your faith you may be, you<br/>are insincere. You consider us deviants, going so far as<br/>to report us to the authorities.')
('Guru', 'Violating the teachings of Aidios is a sin heavier than<br/>any other.')
('Guru', 'Therefore, I shall hand down your deserved divine<br/>punishment in Her place.')
('Young Man 3 (City; Alt Color Version 1)', "What?! Screw that, you crazy cultist! You're<br/>a madman!")
('Young Man 3 (City; Alt Color Version 1)', "I just stopped by for the hell of it! I'm so done<br/>with this! Let us go!")
('Guru', "And you, Follower Walton, stand to receive the<br/>Goddess' divine punishment as well.")
('Walton', "I-I'm well aware that my tithes are insufficient and<br/>I've failed to do enough good deeds!")
('Walton', "But I've been trying very hard to serve the faith by<br/>handing out flyers and recruiting people!")
('Walton', 'I will serve as best I possibly can. Please, I beg for a<br/>merciful judgment!')
('Guru', 'You admit your failure at doing enough good deeds,<br/>but fail to acknowledge all the evil burdens you carry<br/>with you.')
('Guru', 'You continue to fail to take responsibility for<br/>your past. Were you not a drinker and a gambler?<br/>One that neglected his family while at it?')
('Guru', "Your lack of good deeds and the heavy weight of your<br/>evil deeds tip the Goddess' scales ever away from<br/>Her favor.")
('Walton', "Th-That can't be!")
('Walton', "I thought that by repenting and dedicating myself to<br/>my faith, my sins would go away and I'd be able to<br/>return to my family!")
('Guru', "That would only be possible if you'd evened the scales<br/>with good deeds. Dare you object to the<br/>Goddess' judgment?")
('Walton', 'Agh... N-No!')
('Guru', "You needn't fear. Divine punishment as it may be,<br/>our sacred ritual will cleanse you from your sins.")
('Guru', 'Open your arms wide to your judgment. I shall<br/>observe your last moments myself.')
('Guru', 'Now, away with you three.')
('Guru', "With today's judgments, Aidios' scales find<br/>themselves even once more.")
('Guru', 'May you all continue with your good deeds evermore,<br/>so that the Goddess may acknowledge you.')
('Young Man 1 (City; Alt Color Version 1)', 'Glory to Libra Domina!<br/>Praise be to Libra Domina!')
('Agnès', 'This is utterly beyond the pale...')
('Agnès', 'Letting a religious movement like this stand is a<br/>threat to everyone.')
('Aaron', "I doubt they're just going to walk out of here now<br/>that we heard all of that.")
('Aaron', "Probably going to try to convert us the hard way, if<br/>that's what it takes.")
('Van', "Makes me feel sick. Let's bounce before Carson<br/>gets back.")
('Van', "Let's chase after our client's father and the rest.")
('System', "Afterwards, Van's team managed to sneak out of the<br/>concert hall without being noticed by Carson.")
('System', 'When they got outside, they saw the guru boarding a<br/>luxury sedan driven by a Libra Domina follower.')
('System', 'They also saw Walton and the two transgressors<br/>being forced into a second car.')
('System', 'Van approached the leader as they were climbing into<br/>the cars, managing to slip something onto<br/>him unseen.')
('Feri', "Did you just attach something to the guru's clothes?")
('Aaron', 'I saw that. Did you plant something on his clothes?')
('Agnès', "Was it a transmitter? That's the kind of thing you<br/>hear about in spy novels and such...")
('Van', "You got it. Bit of an older model, really, but it's the<br/>same grade used by foreign intelligence divisions<br/>and such.")
('Van', "Got it through some...let's say less than legal means.<br/>Been waitin' for a while to get the chance to use it.")
('Van', 'It will send its signal straight to a Xipha.')
('Van', "But let's report back to our client first. Gotta make<br/>sure he's aware that we found his dad.")
('Risette', 'Allow me to make the report, then.')
('Van', "Go for it. Let's hurry, gang!")
('System', 'Van and company got into their own car and soon<br/>started following the signal shown on the Xipha.')
('System', 'Soon after, the transmitter stopped, and they arrived<br/>at the last place they could trace its signal.')
('Van', 'Ready, then?')
('Quatre', 'Yes. Ready whenever you are.')
('Van', "All right. Sendin' now.")
('Feri', 'And now we wait.')
('Aaron', 'Now we wait for them to bite.')
('Risette', 'All we have to do now is wait.')
('Agnès', 'Actually, what did you write in the message?')
('Van', "Made a point of being real vague with 'em.")
('Van', "But I basically said that I didn't have all the money,<br/>and asked if they'd settle for a bit less.")
('Agnès', "So you made it look like you're at least willing to pay.")
('Agnès', 'That would compel them to reply, at least.')
('Quatre', "Well, it wouldn't be good for our plan if they didn't.")
('Van', "Heh. Nothin' to worry about, it looks like.")
('Quatre', "I've got a response on my end, too! Looking at the<br/>orbal wave pattern, it's definitely a direct connection.")
('Van', "Lemme read. Their reply is, 'No. Won't budge on the<br/>price—not even a single mira.'")
('Feri', "They're so greedy...")
('Aaron', 'Greedy bastard.')
('Risette', 'Quite avaricious, they are.')
('Quatre', 'Okay! Analysis complete!')
('Agnès', 'Did you locate the transmitter?')
('Quatre', "I've got an address.")
('Quatre', "It's west-northwest from our current location.<br/>No exact distance, though.")
('Van', 'No, but we got a line—and a whole lotta places along<br/>that line where the source is.')
('Van', 'If we get to trace another line, but from a<br/>different direction...')
('Agnès', 'Then the lines will intersect, pinpointing the exact<br/>location of our criminal!')
('Quatre', 'Exactly.')
('Quatre', 'We should try to aim for as perpendicular a point as<br/>we possibly can.')
('Quatre', "Let's send our next transmission from across the river.")
('Quatre', 'Okay. This looks good.')
('Van', "I'll shoot 'em another message, then.")
('Van', "Wrote, 'I got all the money ready. Where should I<br/>send it to this time?'")
('Van', 'Aaand sent.')
('Van', "Well, aren't you quick.")
('Agnès', 'They replied quite quickly both times.')
('Feri', 'They really must want to get the mira.')
('Aaron', "Again, greedy bastard. Bet they're rubbing their<br/>hands already, waiting for the dough.")
('Risette', 'They must be quite eager to get the money.')
('Quatre', 'Analysis complete! I pinpointed their location!')
('Quatre', "It's southwest from here, under the bridge across<br/>the river!")
('Van', "All right, then. Come on, y'all. Let's close the book<br/>on this one!")
('Agnès', 'So is that our criminal?')
('Quatre', 'Most likely, yes.')
('Van', 'Only one way to find out.')
(40301, 'Just a liiittle more.')
(40301, "Oh? Did they do it? Let's see...")
('System', "'I changed my mind. I reported this to the police.<br/>They're on to you, and should be beating down your<br/>door at any second.'")
(40301, 'WHAT?!')
(40301, "No, no. Calm down. There's no way they can<br/>find me!")
(40301, 'Gonna book it, though. Just to be safe...')
('Van', "Nope. Sorry. Might've worked if we didn't know<br/>exactly where you were already. You can thank my<br/>assistant here for that. Pretty talented, eh?")
('Quatre', "Your security can't measure up to the one at the<br/>Institute of Science. Not even close.")
(40301, "Wait, who are you?! Don't tell me he really did sic the<br/>cops on me!")
('Agnès', "We're not police, nor are we bracers. Van here is<br/>a spriggan.")
('Feri', 'Give up!')
('Aaron', 'Make this easy for us and stay still.')
('Risette', 'If you would, please surrender.')
('System', 'After realizing there was no way to escape, the<br/>criminal gave up on resisting.')
('System', 'After Oslo arrived, the group began questioning<br/>the criminal.')
('Van', "You ain't even the big boss there, but<br/>some part-timer?")
(40301, "Th-That's right...")
(40301, 'After I sent the boss the full amount, all I got was a<br/>tiny paycheck.')
(40301, 'Even that already ran out...')
(40301, 'I-I promise this was my first time doing this!')
('Agnès', "Just because the crime was only committed one time<br/>doesn't mean that you're not to blame.")
('Van', "Lady's right, kid. That's just a lame excuse.")
(40301, "I-I'm sorry!")
('Quatre', 'How much do you know about the organization you<br/>were working for?')
(40301, 'Nothing! Nothing, I promise! I just got the orders on<br/>my phone.')
('Feri', 'They were just using you...')
('Aaron', "Man, you're just a chump.")
('Risette', 'So he was just a disposable pawn in this game.')
('Van', "Well, our guy here was clearly the one blackmailin'<br/>you, but he was just the lowest rung on that ladder.")
('Van', "Sorry to say, but it doesn't look like you'll be gettin'<br/>your money back.")
('Oslo', "It's all right. I'd already given up on that.")
('Oslo', 'My biggest concern is what comes after.')
('Van', "Yeah, that's the ticket.")
('Van', "We caught the blackmailer himself, but the blackmail<br/>material's probably still in the hands of whoever hired<br/>this kid.")
('Van', "We didn't get to the root of the problem, so we can't<br/>guarantee they ain't gonna keep comin' back for you.")
('Van', "But this mook sure ain't gonna get us to the big<br/>boss either.")
('Van', "Not sure there's much more we can do at this point.")
('Oslo', 'Oh, no... Wh-What should I do, then?')
('Van', 'Well...')
('Van', 'At this point, you should hand it over to the cops.')
('Oslo', 'B-But if I do that—')
('Van', 'Yeah, people are gonna find out.')
('Van', "We didn't fix the whole issue, so you don't gotta pay<br/>the full fee. Half's fine.")
('Van', 'Just to be clear, though, the cops should respect<br/>your privacy.')
('Van', "Ain't likely your clients will hear about this.")
('Van', "How's that for a solution?")
('Oslo', 'I suppose it might be my best option.')
('Oslo', "But don't worry about your fee. I'll pay it in full.<br/>I'm the one that made this whole mess.")
('Van', 'All right. As for you...')
(40301, 'Eek...')
('Van', "Talk to the cops. Tell 'em everything. You said it was<br/>your first time, yeah? Should probably get off with<br/>nothin' but a slap on the wrist, then.")
('Van', "Let me be real with you, kid. Consider yourself lucky<br/>that this'll be the end of it. A road like this can only<br/>lead to a very, very dark future.")
('Van', 'Got it?')
(40301, 'Y-Yes sir!')
('Van', 'Can always pretend none of it ever happened.')
('Oslo', 'H-How can we do that?')
('Van', 'You never looked at any weird sites, and never had<br/>any problem.')
('Van', 'We can make that the case.')
('Oslo', 'C-Can you really do that?!')
('Van', "Well, it's up to my assistant here.")
('Van', "How 'bout it? Think you can manage?")
('Quatre', "*sigh* I'm not too happy about it, but if the only<br/>people this will affect are criminals, then I suppose I<br/>can let it slide.")
('Quatre', "I'll need Risette's assistance, of course, but it should<br/>be doable.")
('Van', 'Knew I could count on ya.')
('Oslo', 'P-Please! That would be great!')
('Risette', 'Very well, then. Shall we?')
('Quatre', 'Of course. Thank you for the help.')
('Quatre', '*sigh* All right.')
('Quatre', 'Let me contact Risette, then.')
('System', "By making use of Marduk's servers, Quatre and<br/>Risette together erased Oslo's former account.")
('System', 'After thoroughly erasing all traces of it, the two of<br/>them then issued Oslo a new account, using a backup<br/>to preserve the account data.')
('Quatre', 'That should solve matters.')
('Quatre', "We can't just erase the data the criminals have on<br/>your actions, of course.")
('Quatre', "But by doing this, they shouldn't be able to link it<br/>back to you anymore.")
('Quatre', 'Fortunately, the only person you made explicit<br/>contact with was this blackmailer.')
('Oslo', 'Oh, thank goodness...')
('Van', 'Yeah, better be grateful. They did a superb job here.')
('Van', 'Now, as for you...')
(40301, 'Eek...')
('Van', "Seems like this really is your first time, so we're gonna<br/>sweep your little fun bit of blackmailin' under the rug.")
('Van', "Assumin' you quit your job, that is. Let me say, kid,<br/>that you better jump ship now if you're not willin' to<br/>commit to the criminal lifestyle.")
('Van', "If you keep layin' with criminals, you'll eventually<br/>reach a point where there's no goin' back.")
('Van', "Either pull out now, or you'll get pulled right in.<br/>You lookin' to lose yourself forever in the pitch-black<br/>depths of the underworld?")
(40301, "I-I'll quit! I don't want any more part in this!")
('Van', "You sure you're not just sayin' that to get out of<br/>this bind?")
(40301, 'I-I really mean it!')
(40301, "I don't know about the people above me at all. I got<br/>recommended in by some guy.")
(40301, "He's kind of a recruiter or sorts. Name's Clément.")
(40301, "But that's all I know! Please believe me!")
('Van', "Fine. But I ain't forgettin' you. If I catch you back on<br/>your old haunts, you'll get what's comin' to you.<br/>Got it?")
(40301, 'Got it!')
('Van', '(Clément... I should keep that name in mind.)')
('Quatre', "Well, that solves this case. It wasn't exactly the most<br/>satisfying solution, I'll say...")
('Van', "You get that a lot when you're workin' as a spriggan.")
('Van', "This country's darkness is deep-rooted. It's too deep<br/>for anyone. Ain't no way one person or group can just<br/>clear it all away.")
('Van', 'Not the bracers, and, hell, not even the government.')
('Van', "A spriggan's job is to take care of those that fall<br/>through the cracks.")
('Van', "We ain't after fairy-tale endings—can't afford to<br/>chase those. Just gotta go for the best ones we can<br/>get without compromisin' our values.")
('Quatre', '...Okay. I think I understand, at least a little.')
('Quatre', "It's dawned on me what the purpose of a spriggan's<br/>job is, and why you do it, Van.")
('Agnès', 'Quatre...')
('Van', "That's good. If you've figured that much at least, I'd<br/>call your trainin' a success.")
('Van', "Oh, well. At the end of the day, I need to eat, and<br/>that's the real reason I'm workin' at all.")
('Quatre', 'And you had to dash the nice conclusion with that<br/>sprinkle of cynicism right at the end...')
('Quatre', "Still, I suppose that's the most spriggan-like way to<br/>tie a ribbon on it.")
('Agnès', 'Goodness...')
('System', 'Quest Orbal Net Fraud completed!')
('System', 'Received')
('Van', 'Hey, is that...?')
('Judith', 'Phew. That should get them off my tail...<br/>Wait—YOU?!')
('Van', "Heya. Heck of a coincidence runnin' into you here.<br/>'Specially at this hour.")
('Van', 'Saw that article of yours on Buzzraider, by the way.')
('Van', 'Lemme guess: on the run from paparazzi right now?')
('Judith', 'Wh-What if I am?')
('Judith', 'Ahem! To be clear, that article is—')
('Van', "Don't worry. I can make a guess.")
('Van', "You checkin' out talents and sports figures who've got<br/>ties to the mafia, yeah?")
('Van', "Can't say I blame you. The why of things aside, he<br/>HAS been goin' all around these shady spots for<br/>weird reasons.")
('Judith', "Wait, you've got detailed info on him?!")
('Van', "Look, I can't exactly spill too much, but I can tell you<br/>this:")
('Van', "You can lay off the Red Comet. He's one-hundred<br/>percent clean, trust me. Least when it comes to what<br/>you're lookin' into.")
('Judith', 'You gotta be kidding me... So what was I even<br/>doing all this for?!')
('Judith', 'And I got chewed out by my mom and grammy for<br/>it, too...')
('Van', "Oh? Got complaints about how you're handlin' your<br/>other job?")
('Judith', 'O-Other job? I have no clue what you could<br/>possibly mean!')
('Elaine', 'Van? What are you doing here? And...who would this<br/>woman be?')
('Judith', "(You're kidding! That's Elaine Auclair, the bracer!)")
('Judith', "(Come on! I swear, it's just one thing after another!)")
('Judith', "Anyway! I have to go, but don't you dare think you've<br/>beaten me!")
('Elaine', 'That was Judith Lanster, right? The actress?')
('Van', 'Yeah. You know her?')
('Elaine', "Sort of. We'd just met at an event before.")
('Elaine', "I imagine you'd be more familiar with her than I am.<br/>Heard you two got acquainted in Tharbad.")
('Elaine', 'Well enough to meet outside of work, too, it<br/>looks like.')
('Van', "C'mon, it ain't like that. Have a little faith in me.")
('Elaine', 'Oh, yeah? All right, then.')
('Elaine', 'So? What are you actually doing out here in Riverside<br/>at this hour?')
('Van', 'Searching for someone, actually.')
('Van', "Someone got dragged into workin' an underworld job<br/>without bein' aware of it.")
('Elaine', "You're investigating an underworld job, too?")
('Van', "'Too'? Are you up to the same thing?")
('Elaine', 'I am, yes. One of their scam victims made a request<br/>to the bracers.')
('Elaine', "I'm looking for a man named Clément right now.<br/>He's likely the go-between that hired the part-timers.")
('Van', 'Clément sure gets around, huh.')
('Van', "We're basically barkin' up the same tree, then.")
('Elaine', 'That we are.')
('Elaine', 'I came to Riverside because we had a report that<br/>Clément had been spotted here.')
('Elaine', 'Do you mind if I tag along with you?')
('Van', 'Not at all. Might make things easier for us all.')
('System', 'Van filled Elaine in on the current state of<br/>his investigation.')
('Elaine', 'An idol named Lulua, huh?')
('Elaine', "Definitely looks like she's an unwitting pawn of<br/>this scheme.")
('Van', 'Sure does. Which honestly puts her in a whole<br/>lotta trouble.')
('Van', "Let's check out the concert hall.")
('Ticket Clerk', "Oh, Lulua? No, she wasn't on stage today.")
('Ticket Clerk', 'Hey, Natalie. You got any idea where she is?')
('Natalie', "A little, I guess. I've been thinking about her a lot as<br/>of late.")
('Natalie', 'I did happen to see her.')
('Natalie', "It stuck out to me because she was talking with some<br/>older woman I'd never seen before.")
('Van', "That's a lead.")
('Elaine', 'Did you happen to overhear what they were<br/>talking about?')
('Natalie', 'Eh, kinda? Something about grabbing tea at the<br/>food stalls.')
('Natalie', 'I think I heard something about trying out the tacos.')
('Van', 'Tacos? Got it.')
('Elaine', 'Thank you for the information.')
('Gordon', 'Right, right. Was just before dark when Lulua and<br/>the old lady stopped by my stall.')
('Gordon', "Think they were meetin' with some middle-aged man<br/>or somethin'. He was waitin' for 'em at the table.")
('Gordon', 'Kind of an odd group, if you ask me.')
('Elaine', '(A middle-aged man...)')
('Van', '(Might be Clément.)')
('Van', 'Notice anything else out of the ordinary?')
('Gordon', "Can't say I did. Couldn't hear them all the way<br/>from here.")
('Gordon', "They were talkin' for a good while before the man got<br/>real worked up.")
('Gordon', "Looks like things got real heated, so they up an' left.<br/>Went right across the river. I was wonderin' what<br/>came of them.")
('Gordon', "Don't know anything else, sorry.")
('Van', "That's plenty to go on.")
('Elaine', 'It is. Thank you for all of the information.')
('Van', "This sure is startin' to stink.")
('Elaine', "Agreed. I wasn't expecting someone likely to be<br/>Clément to actually crop up here.")
('Elaine', 'We need to follow their trail, and now.')
('Van', "Agreed. Let's see if we got any other witnesses.")
('Daphne', "Oh, what am I going to do now? I can't believe<br/>this happened...")
('Elaine', '(Looks like something happened to her.)')
('Van', "(This might be who we're lookin' for.)")
('Van', 'Hey there, granny. Got a sec?')
('Elaine', "We'd like to speak to you, if we may have a moment.")
('System', "Van, pretending to be Elaine's assistant, inquired into<br/>Daphne and Lulua.")
('Daphne', "Oh, for an A-rank bracer and her assistant to show up<br/>just when I need them most... This must be the<br/>Goddess' guidance at hand.")
('Daphne', "But you're right, yes. I'm Daphne.")
('Elaine', 'Thank you for confirming that.')
('Van', "Heard Lulua was helpin' you as part of her<br/>volunteer work.")
('Van', 'Mind telling us what happened?')
('Daphne', 'Not at all. I do have something to share with you.')
('Daphne', 'About an hour ago, Lulua was taken away by a man<br/>called Clément.')
('Elaine', 'He straight up took her?')
('Van', "Well, shit's getting urgent.")
('Van', 'To be clear, Clément was the man that introduced<br/>you and Lulua, yeah?')
('Daphne', "That's right. Until today, I wouldn't have pegged him<br/>for anything less than a kind and trustworthy man.")
('Daphne', 'I came tonight because he wanted to discuss<br/>something with Lulua and me.')
('Daphne', "That's when he started trying to sell me some kind of<br/>medical insurance.")
('Daphne', "It all sounded splendid, but I'm not naïve. I know<br/>when something's too good to be true, it probably is.")
('Van', "Good on you for not fallin' for that old trick.")
('Daphne', 'I have some experience, since I do have a<br/>different insurance already.')
('Daphne', "When I started asking for details, Clément couldn't<br/>answer me.")
('Daphne', "Lulua must've caught on to my suspicions, because<br/>she also started asking him questions.")
('Daphne', "He didn't like that at all, and started yelling at us.<br/>And then...")
('Elaine', 'And then he dragged Lulua away.')
('Daphne', 'Yes... I tried to chase after, but I lost sight of them<br/>right around here.')
('Daphne', 'I was afraid that if I contacted the police or the guild,<br/>they might suspect Lulua as well.')
('Daphne', "I didn't know what to do...")
('Van', "Okay. I think I've got the picture.")
('Elaine', "Don't worry. The guild will do the best we can for<br/>Lulua's sake.")
('Elaine', 'Rest easy. You can leave the rest to us.')
('Daphne', 'Oh... Thank you so much.')
('Daphne', "Do you know where she might've been taken to?")
('Van', "Ain't hard to take a guess if around here's where you<br/>lost sight of 'em.")
('Van', "(Must've gone into the Blacklight District.)")
('Elaine', '(Undoubtedly.)')
('Elaine', "We need to head after her quick, but we shouldn't be<br/>too careless either.")
('Elaine', "I'll be waiting by the entrance. Just tell me when<br/>you're ready.")
('Van', 'Got it.')
('Elaine', 'We need to go save Lulua. Are you ready?')
('System', 'Choosing this will cause the main story to advance.<br/>Your free time tonight will end once you begin the<br/>rescue mission.')
('Van', "Yeah. Let's go put Clément in the trash.")
('Van', "I'll contact Seyla, my client, to make a<br/>progress report.")
('Elaine', "Okay. Let me know when you're ready.")
('System', 'Van contacted Seyla and filled her in on the situation.<br/>After she pleaded to come with them, they set off.')
('System', "Together the three of them headed into the<br/>Blacklight District in pursuit of Lulua's kidnappers.")
('System', 'And so...')
('Van', "'Go to the stable along the river upon which the<br/>injured iron steeds descend.'")
('Van', "That's gotta be the body shop, yeah?")
('Van', "Well, I'm here. Now what?")
('Bradley', "Hey, Junifer. Van's here.")
('Junifer', 'There you are!')
('Junifer', 'Good on ya for solving that riddle!')
('Van', 'You put up the request, then?')
('Junifer', "Oh, nope! Not me. Just heard through the grapevine<br/>what was goin' on, and offered to lend a hand.")
('Junifer', "No way I wasn't gonna pitch in!")
('Van', 'Pitch in to what? Be straight with me here.')
('Junifer', 'Heh, you can leave all the questions for later!')
('Junifer', 'You took the subway here, yeah?')
('Junifer', "I assume your car's gonna be in its usual garage.<br/>Mind if I go get it?")
('Van', "That came outta nowhere. Y'all should have a key<br/>already since this is where I bring my car to<br/>get serviced.")
('Van', "What're you up to, though?")
('Junifer', "Nothing bad! Surprise! You're getting a nice, free car<br/>wash on your dear truck!")
('Junifer', "Uncle here's gonna give it his best shot, too, so we'll<br/>get 'er nice and shiny!")
('Van', 'Oh. Okay? Thanks for the offer. Little outta<br/>nowhere, though...')
('Van', "I'd definitely like that, but lemme pay for it.<br/>Nothin' scares me more than free stuff.")
('Junifer', "Hey, hey, absolutely not! It's fine. Don't look a gift<br/>car wash in the...water. But seriously, we don't need<br/>your money!")
('Bradley', "Done a splendid job right there of not lookin'<br/>suspicious, you know.")
('Bradley', "Look, Van. Don't play hard to get here. You won't<br/>owe us a thing. Client's already paid in full.")
('Bradley', 'So just shut up and get your car washed!')
('Van', 'Client? Who the hell puts up an order like this?')
('Van', "But fine. Since you insist, I'll leave you to it.")
('Junifer', 'Great! Lemme go get her!')
('Junifer', "Uncle, better get your butt in gear while I'm away for<br/>the best car wash ever!")
('Bradley', '*sigh* If I gotta...')
('System', 'Junifer immediately left for Old Town.')
('System', "When she returned, she did so with Van's pickup<br/>truck, bringing it into the shop.")
('Junifer', "Okie dokie! Your baby's here!")
('Junifer', "Leave it to us! She'll shine so bright you won't even<br/>need to turn on the headlights!")
('Junifer', "She'll get a nice new waterproof wax finish on the<br/>outside and a nice and thorough vacuuming on<br/>the inside!")
('Junifer', "And don't you worry about all the small details!<br/>Uncle's gonna handle the real delicate parts.")
('Bradley', "'Scuse you.")
('Van', 'Thanks for giving it the works.')
('Van', 'Might not need to polish her myself in a while with<br/>all that.')
('Junifer', "You won't regret it! Always nice to work on a car as<br/>nice as yours.")
('Bradley', 'Well, I suppose I have to give you this, now.')
('Bradley', "Here. Get goin' to the next place while we clean<br/>your car.")
('Van', "Next? Wait, there's more?")
('System', "'Second task: On the gateway to our fair capital lies a<br/>merchant whose store carries varieties for every man.'")
('System', "'Reach him to accomplish this task.'")
('Van', "Another riddle? And this one ain't any easier than the<br/>last one.")
('Bradley', "I'm sure you have questions, and I can't answer any<br/>of them.")
('Bradley', "So don't bother asking and go solve the<br/>riddle instead.")
('Van', "*sigh*... Fine. Guess I'll head to the next spot, then.")
('Van', 'Thanks a bunch, you two.')
('Junifer', 'Have a good one!')
('Van', "(I don't get it. What's the point in gettin' my<br/>car washed? What's this client of theirs up to?)")
('Van', "(But with Junifer and Bradley in on this, it can't be<br/>that bad, right?)")
('Van', "(Eh. No point in worryin' now. If I want an answer,<br/>I'm probably gonna have to find one myself.)")
('Van', '(I should ask the two idols about Jess.)')
('Van', '(Should I wait till their break time?)')
('Lulua', 'Hi there!')
('Seyla', 'Thanks for coming to see us.')
('Van', 'You two did great up there.')
('Van', "Sorry to bother while you're on your break, but I got a<br/>few questions for you.")
('System', 'Van explained the situation to the two idols and<br/>inquired about Jess.')
('Lulua', 'Oh, no! Jess, of all people...')
('Seyla', 'Now that you mention it, I did think he was acting<br/>strange this morning.')
('Van', 'This morning?')
('Agnès', 'Did you see Jess somewhere?')
('Feri', 'Did you see Jess?')
('Aaron', 'You saw him this morning?')
('Risette', 'Did either of you see Jess today?')
('Quatre', 'So you saw Jess somewhere?')
('Judith', "Where'd you see him?")
('Bergard', 'Huh, you saw Jess?')
('Seyla', 'We bumped into each other at Brothers Music<br/>Shop, over in Tyrell.')
('Lulua', 'We stopped by the store to borrow some musical<br/>equipment for our performance today.')
('Lulua', 'Jess was talking to the manager when we got there.')
('Seyla', "He's a regular there.")
('Seyla', 'He was probably saying goodbye to the manager since<br/>Jess was on his way out of the capital.')
('Van', 'Did you and Jess talk about anything?')
('Lulua', 'I told him we were gonna have a performance and he<br/>wished me the best.')
('Lulua', "I was hoping he'd be there, so I made a point of<br/>inviting him.")
('Seyla', 'He said he appreciated the invite, but was busy.')
('Seyla', 'Mentioned leaving the capital to see his<br/>favorite flower.')
('Van', 'Favorite flower? Wonder what that could be.')
('Van', 'Maybe Raymond knows.')
('Agnès', 'He does work as a florist.')
('Feri', 'Oh, yeah! Since he sells flowers and everything.')
('Aaron', 'If you wanna learn about flowers, might as well ask<br/>a florist.')
('Risette', 'A reasonable assumption. Raymond does work as<br/>a florist.')
('Quatre', "Certainly. He's got that job with the flower seller.")
('Judith', 'Well, he does work selling flowers, right?')
('Bergard', 'Consult the experts, right? Flowers for a flower seller,<br/>and all.')
('Van', 'Thanks for the help. Much appreciated, you two.')
('Seyla', 'It was nothing.')
('Lulua', 'Hope you can help Jess out!')
('Van', 'Okay, then. Back to Raymond we go.')
('Van', 'Okay, back to Raymond for now.')
('Agnès', "Yes, let's. We'll need to give a progress report on<br/>our investigation.")
('Feri', 'Of course! We should report to him on our progress.')
('Aaron', 'Yup. Have to fill him in.')
('Risette', 'Of course. We ought to report on our progress.')
('Quatre', 'Yeah, we should give him a progress report.')
('Judith', "Yes, let's fill him in on how things are going.")
('Bergard', "Right. Let's get him up to date on everything.")
('Van', "Hey there. Heard there was some sort of race thing<br/>goin' on?")
('Van', "Let's hear it. Might be able to join, depending on<br/>the details.")
('Graham', "Thanks, Van! Okay, let's get everyone here so I<br/>can explain.")
('Graham', "All right. Looks like everyone's here.")
('Junifer', "I know everyone's busy, but thanks. You in<br/>particular, Van. It's reassurin' having you here.")
('Lucio', '...')
('Van', "No prob. Where's the rest of the crew, though?")
('Van', 'Bit of a shock to see you here, kid.')
('Van', "Lotta shit goin' on with your family lately. You okay?")
('Lucio', "Hmph. Don't pry.")
('Lucio', 'But regardless of that, I appreciate what you did the<br/>other day.')
('Lucio', "Today's the day we come back for the promised<br/>rematch with Edith's racers.")
('Junifer', "Hot damn, is it gonna rain today or somethin'?<br/>Can't believe it! Lucio just said thanks! Or...somethin'<br/>like that.")
('Junifer', "You were being way nicer than usual, so I was<br/>wonderin' what the heck happened there.")
('Graham', "My guess is Van gave you a hand and we weren't<br/>aware of it?")
('Lucio', "And why should that matter to you? Keep your nose<br/>out of business that's not yours.")
('Junifer', 'Okay? Sure, whatever. Rude as always.')
('Van', "Wasn't expectin' the High Bloods of all people to join<br/>in on this.")
('Lucio', "Well, as I said already, we're here for our<br/>promised rematch.")
('Junifer', "Gotta say, we haven't seen you 'round these parts for<br/>a while, but you've definitely changed.")
('Junifer', "More honest, I guess? Like you had a big helpin' of<br/>humbling pie.")
('Graham', "Right. I heard your family's been having a rough go<br/>of it.")
('Lucio', 'A commoner like you has no place prying into<br/>my life. Know your place.')
('Junifer', 'Ahaha. More things change, more they stay the same.')
('Van', "I don't think I know everyone here.")
('Lucio', "I suppose I'm yet to introduce myself. I'm Lucio, of<br/>the High Bloods.")
('Lucio', "We normally race around Oración, but we've<br/>expanded our reach to Edith as of late.")
('Lucio', 'We got into a bit of a conflict at the time, true.')
('Lucio', 'Some biker lady got involved and served us a<br/>harsh loss.')
('Lucio', "We're here now because the time's right for<br/>a rematch.")
('Van', "(He talkin' about Hermès?)")
('Van', "Got'cha. That's why you made the request for us?")
('Graham', 'Yeah. We were gonna head out on the highway for<br/>some high-speed unrestricted races.')
('Graham', 'But it looks like our friends the High Bloods here<br/>learned a good lesson about reckless driving.')
('Graham', 'They were hoping for a more...fun kind of race.<br/>Something everyone can join in on.')
('Junifer', 'But Downey and Hyades wanted to spend the day<br/>enjoying the festivities.')
('Junifer', "Won't be joinin' us today.")
('Lucio', 'My group consists of two people. Myself,<br/>and Damian. A bike rider.')
('Lucio', "We're not the only ones that came, of course, but the<br/>other two couldn't be bothered to be here, on account<br/>of the festivities.")
('Graham', "You probably figured it out already, but we're a little<br/>short on people.")
('Graham', 'So, hey. Figured we might as well try to get you to<br/>join, Van.')
('Graham', 'You and...maybe some other people? How about it?<br/>Wanna help us track down some more racers?')
('Van', 'Well...')
('Graham', 'We were gonna have a big, fun race with a bunch<br/>of people.')
('Graham', "But we, uh, kinda don't have a bunch of people.")
('Graham', 'So, hey. Figured we might as well try to get you to<br/>join, Van.')
('Graham', 'You and...maybe some other people? How about it?<br/>Wanna help us track down some more racers?')
('Van', "Sure, I could join, but I was hopin' to hit up a few<br/>places first.")
('Van', "You guys okay with me comin' back later?")
('Graham', "Of course! We know you're busy.")
('Junifer', "But don't flake on us! Come back when you've got<br/>the time!")
('Lucio', 'Hmph...')
('Van', "All right. Don't mind joinin'. I'll even ask some other<br/>people to join, too.")
('Agnès', 'A lot of people came by today to enjoy the festivities.')
('Agnès', "I don't imagine it'll be too hard to find people<br/>to participate. We just have to look.")
('Feri', 'A lot of people came by for the festival today!')
('Feri', 'I bet we can get a bunch of people to join if we<br/>ask around!')
('Aaron', 'You mind if I join in?')
('Van', 'You got something to drive with?')
('Aaron', "I'm borrowing your old master's motorbike till the<br/>end of the festival, so I could use that.")
('Aaron', 'Though it could get damaged in the race. Maybe I<br/>should run this past him first...')
('Aaron', "Eh, I'm lazy. It should be fine.")
('Van', 'Get your ass on the phone, my dude.')
('Aaron', 'Fiiiiiine.')
('Aaron', "Done. He said, 'Go wild.'")
('Aaron', 'As wild as I can go with you nannying me<br/>around, anyway.')
('Van', "Keep runnin' that mouth and I'm gonna have you<br/>runnin' soon.")
('Graham', 'Haha. Glad to have you join us.')
('Junifer', 'Heck yeah! This is gonna be a sick race! A face-off<br/>between cars and bikes!')
('Lucio', "You're a biker? Hmph. We'll see if you have a hope<br/>against Damian.")
('Aaron', "Just don't come crying to me if you don't like what<br/>you see.")
('Aaron', "But whatever. Let's get looking. We need more<br/>drivers still.")
('Risette', "There's a lot of people gathered from all over today,<br/>after all.")
('Risette', "Recruiting participants shouldn't be too difficult<br/>a challenge.")
('Quatre', "Well, there's a lot of people in the capital, thanks to<br/>the festival.")
('Quatre', "You have a lot of contacts, don't you, Van? I imagine<br/>it'll be easier to find participants.")
('Judith', "Well, it's the middle of the festival. There should be<br/>plenty of people here in the capital. At least SOME<br/>of them should be up to it.")
('Judith', "Why don't we try chatting them up, see what<br/>they think?")
('Bergard', "Hmm... If you're going to ask around, why not<br/>ask Aaron?")
('Van', "Huh? Why him? You're the one with the motorbike.")
('Bergard', 'Actually, I lent it to him for the duration of<br/>the festival.')
('Bergard', "He would jump at the chance to join. I'm sure he'd<br/>love to put those wheels through their paces.")
('Van', "I guess. I could see him gettin' a kick outta this.")
('Van', "But the same goes for you, Master. I figured you'd<br/>enjoy the thrill of the race.")
('Bergard', "I would rather pass the torch to you young'uns.<br/>I'm getting too old for this, I'm afraid.")
('Bergard', "Why don't you give him a call? I'm sure he'd say yes<br/>in a heartbeat.")
('Van', 'All righty. One minute.')
('Van', "Welp, you were right. Soon as the word 'race' left my<br/>mouth, he was right on board.")
('Bergard', 'Heh. I thought as much.')
('Bergard', "I'm sure he will have a great time. You all have fun<br/>out there.")
('Graham', 'All right, one person down.')
('Junifer', "Oooh, can't wait to test my own baby against a<br/>biker's mettle!")
('Lucio', "We'll see how he fares, although I doubt he can<br/>compare to Damian.")
('Bergard', "Let's get going, then. I'm sure Aaron's not the only<br/>one who'll want to join.")
('Van', "Yeah. Let's keep this up.")
('Junifer', 'Bring everyone you can! The whole town if<br/>they want!')
('Junifer', "If they wanna race, they're welcome here!")
('Graham', "We'll be here, so come back when you got<br/>more people.")
('Van', 'Sure.')
('System', 'Quest The Autobahn Showdown started!')
('Van', "I'm back. Talked to some folks, saw who wanted to<br/>join up.")
('Van', 'Dunno how many will actually show up, but it should<br/>still be a fair bit.')
('Graham', "Can't wait. I really appreciate it, Van.")
('Junifer', "Well, what're we waiting for?! Let's get goin'!")
('Lucio', 'Very well. I will call Damian and tell him to<br/>rendezvous with us.')
('Graham', 'You ready?')
('Graham', "We'll be leaving the capital for a while, but we can<br/>hold on a moment if you still have something to do.")
('Graham', 'You ready?')
('Graham', "We'll be leaving the capital for a while, but we can<br/>hold on a moment if you still have something to do.")
('Van', "Yeah, just give me a sec here. I'll be back soon.")
('Lucio', "Bold of you to assume you're worthy of delaying the<br/>whole event and keep me waiting. But go on.<br/>Hurry up if you must.")
('Van', "Nah, got nothin'. Let's get goin'.")
('Graham', 'Okay. If everyone else is ready, then we can get going<br/>to the starting point.')
('Junifer', "You vouchin' for these new racers has my mouth<br/>watering here!")
('System', 'Van and everyone else hopped on their vehicles and<br/>headed towards the meeting spot.')
('Agnès', "'Bermotti'... Looks like it's closed right now.")
('Van', "Yeah, nighttime's when the mira really rolls in.<br/>We can come back another time.")
('Van', "He likes hangin' out in the terrace. Let's find a spot<br/>where we can scope things out.")
('Van', "He likes hangin' out in the terrace. Let's find a spot<br/>where we can scope things out.")
('Van', "Well, here's Riverside, the 6th District.<br/>Don't imagine you've been by here often.")
('Agnès', "I've rarely had the need to, so no. I haven't.")
('Agnès', "Although I've heard it's a popular after-class spot<br/>for students.")
('Van', 'Oh, yeah. Place is mighty pretty and got a wide<br/>variety of shops and stalls. A date here scores a ten<br/>outta ten when it comes to the view.')
('Van', "Fun doesn't stop when the sun goes down, either,<br/>what with the concert hall and all the bars around.")
('Agnès', 'You must frequent this place quite a lot, since you<br/>know so much.')
('Agnès', "I didn't have much time to look around last time we<br/>came here.")
('Van', 'Work hard, and we might be able to get to see the<br/>sights for a bit.')
('Van', "Let's start here.")
('Agnès', "I've been wanting to check out the food truck in<br/>more detail since we didn't have the chance last time.")
('Van', "Not surprised a prim and proper private school<br/>student hasn't eaten at one before. Y'all are too<br/>fancy for street food.")
('Agnès', 'I really want to try out their food!')
('Shino', "Welcome to Shino's Bar. It's nice to see you, Van.")
('Van', 'Hey, Shino. Takeout for me today. Two sorbets,<br/>extra caramel sauce.')
('Shino', 'One moment.')
('Van', '...<br/>(Yup. Just as I thought.)')
('Agnès', 'Is something the matter?')
('Van', "Nah. Don't worry about it.")
('Shino', 'Thanks for waiting. Here are your sorbets.')
('System', 'Van received his order.')
('Shino', "I put an ice pack in there in case you don't get to<br/>them immediately. It should last around two hours.")
('Van', 'Thanks.')
('Van', "Next stop's the orbal café over in Station Street.<br/>Should be about time to give that new latte of theirs<br/>a try.")
('Agnès', 'Of course! We can make up for this afternoon.')
('Dominion Celis', "Aaaaaagh... My head is STILL spinning. So, what?<br/>We've had the wool pulled over our eyes for...going<br/>on three years now?")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'So it seems—though this revelation coming from<br/>who it does is no surprise.')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'I have to assume the commander, the<br/>second-in-command, and the archbishop were the<br/>only people who knew.')
('Dominion Celis', 'That damn, bald-faced liar... The commander, too!<br/>What are we, total strangers?!')
('Dominion Celis', "You know what? I'm in the mood for a rematch!<br/>It's time to kick her ass for good this time!")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "Not to rain on your parade, but the odds aren't quite<br/>stacked in your favor here.")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'Where do the scores stand as of now? Two wins,<br/>seven losses?')
('Dominion Celis', "THREE! Three wins, seven losses excuse you!<br/>And it's not stayin' that way for long!")
('Agnès', '(Th-These two are...)')
('Feri', '(These are the two from the Blacklight District.)')
('Aaron', "(Hey, if it isn't our friends from the<br/>Blacklight District.)")
('Risette', '(They were present at the Blacklight District.)')
('Quatre', '(They are dressed rather oddly. Are you<br/>guys acquainted?)')
('Van', '(Barely, if that.)')
('Dominion Celis', "Hmph. What're you doin' here, spriggan?")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'Ah, speak of the devil.')
('Van', "Guess that chance at another meeting wasn't too far off.")
('Van', 'Got too hot under those hoods? Had to take a<br/>layer off?')
('Dominion Celis', "Pfft, you wish. We were just bein' careful. Let's just<br/>say that we got a complicated relationship with<br/>someone who was also there.")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "This is how we dress on a daily basis.<br/>Appropriate travel attire, regardless of whether it's by<br/>train, airship, or otherwise.")
('Van', 'Oh, right. The needle noggin priest I met way back<br/>kinda dressed like that, too.')
('Van', "You don't look much like your usual travelin' priest or<br/>sister, you know.")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'Haha. There, I will have to agree with you.')
('Dominion Celis', "Don't see what you're laughin' about. It's just clothes.")
('Agnès', 'So...')
('Feri', "You don't actually know each other, then?")
('Aaron', "We're here, too, you know. Mind not ignoring us<br/>while you guys chat?")
('Risette', '...')
('Quatre', 'If I were to guess, I would assume you and Van share<br/>an acquaintance.')
('Van', 'You could say that.')
('Dominion Celis', 'What? You got a problem with us, punk?')
('Dominion Celis', "So you're the spriggan of the Republic—but<br/>personally, I think of you as the dropout of the<br/>Kunlun school.")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "Now, now, Celis. It's not good to pick fights with<br/>him when you've only just met.")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "Even if he is a shady piece of human waste from<br/>Aidios-knows-where who can't figure out which half<br/>of the moral fence he's standing on.")
('Van', 'Just met, but you sure got an opinion on me already.')
('Van', "Not very fair if you ask me. Don't even know who<br/>you two are.")
('Dominion Celis', 'Guess we can tell you that much.')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "*sigh* I'm not pleased, personally, but very well.")
('Dominion Celis', "I'm Celis. Celis Ortesia.")
('Dominion Celis', "Just think of me as your average wanderin' priest.<br/>Pleased to beat ya, spriggan.")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "And I'm Leon Balthazar, also a wandering priest.<br/>I've been assigned to support Celis.")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "It is once again a pleasure, fine folks of Arkride<br/>Solutions—though quite the heavy displeasure in your<br/>boss' case.")
('Van', "Gimme a break here. We barely even know each<br/>other and you're already barin' your teeth at me.")
('Van', "Whatever. You guys already know me, so it saves me<br/>that part of the intro. But the gist is I take jobs from<br/>anyone—long as they don't cross the line.")
('Van', "Even if you two don't like me much, I'll be willin' to<br/>take a job or two from you. Might even help clear up<br/>that nasty impression of me you got.")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "It'll be up to you to prove us wrong.")
('Dominion Celis', 'Do appreciate a man that sticks to his principles.')
('Dominion Celis', "Hah, unbunch your panties, Arkride. We're not here<br/>to pick a fight with you.")
('Quatre', '...I thought my heart was gonna beat right out of<br/>my chest. Those two are clearly not your average<br/>sister and priest.')
('Agnès', "True, but I don't think the part about belonging to<br/>the church was a lie.<br/>(Reminds me of a book I read once.)")
('Feri', "I didn't spot a single opening throughout that whole<br/>conversation, but they weren't being hostile either.<br/>I guess they're okay?")
('Aaron', "Churchfolk armed to the teeth? I might've heard a<br/>rumor or two.")
('Risette', "(I'll need to update our records. The fourth and<br/>eleventh are far stronger than our initial analysis<br/>results indicated.)")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Shooo what 'm tryin' to get at here is ishn't that...<br/>'S that... Well, y'knooow...")
('Dingo', "Come on. That's enough for one day, isn't it?")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Dooon't change the shubjeeect!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Ah, 's yooou! The shpriggan!")
('Dingo', 'Van.')
('Van', "Hey, dude, don't let me keep you. I don't fancy<br/>third-wheeling, so how about I leave you two to it—")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Nooo! Shtay! *hic* Dingo's a JERK!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "He joosht left me behind! An' what did 'e learn?<br/>Nothin'! He'sh doing it again!")
('Van', "So she's the loud kinda drunk.")
('Van', "You know, if Dingo's bein' such a jerk, why not tell<br/>him yourself? You're mighty close to him right now.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'I shure did! I told him off real good!')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "An' what did he do? Jusht blew me off! *hic* Didn't<br/>listen t' a thing I shaid!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "An here I just...'m workin' shooo hard...to...to follow<br/>in his fooshteps...")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'I just... Just wanna... Zzz...')
('Van', 'Lasted longer than I expected.')
('Dingo', 'Yeah, she did.')
('Dingo', 'Sorry. That was an embarrassing way for you to<br/>find us.')
('Van', "Don't sweat it. Not like I don't know you well enough<br/>at this point. Girl's sure got some balls, though.")
('Van', "Follows you all the way to Tharbad, gets kidnapped,<br/>and caps it off with a night of drunken complaints.<br/>It's like she's not even fazed.")
('Dingo', "That might be my fault. I probably shouldn't have<br/>been so soft on her after the fact.")
('Dingo', 'I did try to get it through to her that she needs to be<br/>more careful.')
('Van', "Carefulness doesn't seem to have clocked in tonight,<br/>from the look of it.")
('Dingo', "Not at all. I'll have to try again some other time.<br/>And I definitely can't have her knowing where I'm<br/>going next time I travel.")
('Van', "Losin' a newbie like her shouldn't be THAT hard for<br/>you, right?")
('Van', "But you sure it's worth it? Don't wanna upset the cute<br/>little missy by pushing her away. She's got a thing<br/>for you.")
('Dingo', "I've said it before, but we're from different<br/>publications. Rather than friends, we should<br/>be rivals.")
('Van', "Don't think that really matters much. You'd probably<br/>be rivals even if you worked in the same place.")
('Van', 'But rival or not, she looks up to you. That, at least,<br/>should mean something to you, yeah?')
('Dingo', 'Hmph...')
('Dingo', "I finally got a lead into one of the topics I've<br/>been pursuing.")
('Dingo', 'You know me. All my investigations are a grey area<br/>at best.')
('Dingo', 'The rest? Pitch black. Of the worst kind, and you<br/>know that.')
('Dingo', "I'd much rather she stay far, far away from that world.")
('Dingo', "Maybe it's wrong of me to make that decision for her,<br/>but I don't want her to follow in my footsteps.<br/>She...should walk a brighter, more honest path.")
('Van', "For someone who denies takin' her under your wing,<br/>you sure get overprotective when it comes to her.")
('Dingo', "Look who's talking. You, and your growing office of<br/>assistants you'd stick your neck out for.")
('Dingo', 'Hey... Van. If I...')
('Van', 'If you?')
('Dingo', "...Nothing. You're going out on a trip with your<br/>assistants, right?")
('Dingo', 'Should be a good time. Take the time to<br/>enjoy yourselves.')
('Van', "I...will? That's the plan, at least.")
('Van', 'I swear, just as quick AND creepy as Kitty used to be.<br/>How the hell do you know about that?!')
('Dingo', "That's for me to know.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Nooo, back oooff! Don't go gettin' too coshy with...<br/>with 'im, Dingo! Ish not faiiir! *hic* Not...fair...")
('Van', "Whatever. I'll buy you a souvenir. You don't get to<br/>complain if you don't like it.")
('Dingo', 'I trust you to pick something good.')
('Shaheena', 'Hi, guys!')
('Feri', "It's Saara and Shaheena!")
('Aaron', "I see Sylphid's with you, too.")
('Quatre', 'Who are they?')
('Bergard', 'Hmm? Acquaintances of yours?')
('Agnès', 'We met each other back in Tharbad.')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "Nice to see you. It's been a while.")
('Van', 'What brings you guys here?')
('Fie', "We bumped into each other in town, so I'm showing<br/>them around now.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "We have a guest role in Director Gotti's new film, so<br/>we were invited to come here.")
('Agnès', "You'll be in Director Gotti's next film?!<br/>Congratulations!")
('Aaron', "Be careful with that perv. Don't let him goad you into<br/>doing some skeevy scene or event.")
('Judith', "Don't worry. Nina and I are keeping an eye on him to<br/>make sure he won't try anything funny.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'Thank you for doing that.')
('Fie', "Two of the actresses are already keeping an eye,<br/>making sure they don't get in any trouble.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "I'm tremendously grateful to Judith and Nina.")
('Shaheena', 'Actually, we were on our way to your office to say<br/>hi, Van.')
('Shaheena', 'You got ahead of us there!')
('Van', "Hah. If you have the time, feel free to stop by for a<br/>visit anytime. I'm usually free durin' the day.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "We'll be staying until the Revolution Festival, so I'm<br/>sure we'll have a chance to visit.")
('Risette', "We'll break out our reserve of special snacks for you.")
('Agnès', "We'll get out our reserve of special snacks for you.")
('Van', 'You mean MY reserve? The ones I save for myself?')
('Aaron', 'Oh, you were saving those? Whoops. I ate all of<br/>them already.')
('Van', 'SON OF A—')
('Aaron', 'Hey, Syd. Sorry to keep you waiting.')
('Aaron', 'Hey there. You guys enjoying the festival?')
('Agnès', "Yes we are. I see you're with your friends from<br/>Langport, Aaron?")
('Feri', "We are. They're your friends from Langport, right?")
('Risette', 'Yes, thank you. I see you are with your friends<br/>from Langport.')
('Quatre', "Yep. You're with your Langport friends, I assume?")
('Judith', "Sure are. I see you're spending the festival with your<br/>Langport buddies.")
('Bergard', "Uh-huh. I see you're out with your Langport buds.")
('Van', "Hey, Syd. You feelin' better now? You took quite a<br/>beatin' back there.")
('Syd', "Haha, yeah. Thanks for asking. I'm doing much<br/>better now. Doctor Longkai gave me the okay<br/>to come.")
('Eastern Young Adult', 'Things finally settled down in Langport, so we<br/>decided to pay Aaron a visit.')
('Aaron', 'Pay me a visit? You sounded more like you wanted to<br/>see the sights more than me.')
('Eastern Young Woman', 'Aww, come on! We can do both!')
('Eastern Young Woman', 'Especially with how big the capital is! Gonna need<br/>you to show us around, Aaron!')
('Aaron', "Yeah, yeah. I'll take you to some of my favorite spots.")
('Aaron', 'Figure we can go hang out in the Entertainment<br/>District, see some of my faves.')
('Eastern Young Adult', "Ohh! Edith's Entertainment District? Hell yeah!")
('Syd', "Let's get going already, then!")
('Aaron', 'No can do. Not with the old fart on my ass all<br/>day, anyway.')
('Van', "Call me old fart again and we'll see who's on their ass<br/>by the end of the day.")
('Syd', "Come on! It doesn't matter where, let's just get<br/>going, Aaron!")
('Aaron', 'Sure. Later then, old fart.')
('Van', "Watch it, or I'll throw you into the damn river.")
(40305, "Hey, you there, with the red hair. You're<br/>Aaron, right?")
(40303, 'Found you! With your friends, too, huh?')
(40301, "Your luck's run out, Aaron Wei! You had the<br/>misfortune of meeting me here today! Now face me!")
('Aaron', 'Oh, yeah? You wanna throw down?')
('Van', "Hey, you guys. Don't you dare—")
(40301, 'The loser treats the winner! And not just to one stall.<br/>To ALL the stalls!')
(40301, "As for rules... Okay, let's do best of in three minutes,<br/>one point per touch.")
('Syd', "I'm game! Let's go, Aaron!")
('Aaron', "As long as they don't mind getting their asses handed<br/>to them during the festival, I'm down for some fun!")
('Eastern Young Woman', "Give it to 'em, Aaron! You, too, Syd!")
('Van', "They're...not fightin', then? Looked like they were in<br/>good terms, actually.")
(40303, "They just met a little while ago. I wouldn't call them<br/>friends, but let's just say it's a sort of friendly rivalry<br/>they have.")
(40303, 'Boys will be boys, I guess.')
('Van', "Well, at least he's makin' friends.")
('Aaron', 'Come on, man! Is that all you got? I could fall asleep<br/>here before you hit me!')
(40301, "Shut it, loser! ...Damn, you've got some crazy reflexes!")
('Aaron', "Here. I'll even make it easy for you.")
('Aaron', 'Think you can hit me now?')
(40304, 'You show him, Aaron!')
('Syd', 'One more minute! Keep it steady!')
('Van', 'He sure knows how to draw a crowd, wherever<br/>he goes.')
('System', 'Afterwards, both Aaron and Van—who inadvertently<br/>got drawn into to the contest—won, not failing to<br/>rouse the crowd that gathered around them.')
('System', "Their victory secured, they enjoyed their prize by<br/>taking a victory lap around all the stalls in Riverside at<br/>the losers' expense.")
('Bermotti', "(Ah, Van, dear! You've got perfect timing!)")
('Van', '(Huh? Lemme guess: is our problem from last<br/>night—)')
('Van', "(Huh? What's gotten into you? Why do you look<br/>like—)")
('Agnès', 'O-Oh, Mr. Kincaid!')
('Feri', 'Kasim?!')
('Aaron', 'What kind of hell did we just walk into?')
('Risette', 'Mr. Al-Fayed? As well as Mr. Kincaid, and even...')
('Quatre', "Oh, it's Kincaid and Feri's brother...and...")
('Judith', 'Oh, the CID guy? Wait... Those two are—')
('Bergard', "Didn't think I'd see you out in broad daylight.")
('Harwood', 'Hey, Arkride. Been a lonely ten days since I last<br/>saw you.')
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', 'Thanks a bunch for everything. Including you<br/>handling the game.')
('Kincaid', 'Took you long enough, Van.')
('Van', 'Long enough, my ass. What are you doing?')
('Van', "You plannin' on seein' the Revolution Festival off<br/>with a bang? 'Cause that's all you'll get with these<br/>two here.")
('Harwood', "I think there's a misunderstanding here.")
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', '*sigh* It hurts to hear something like that from a<br/>former pupil of mine.')
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', "You should already be aware that Marduk's taking<br/>part in the weapons reveal.")
('Feri', "That's right. I think I saw you at the<br/>ceremony, Kasim...")
('Van', "Well...at least you're relatively reasonable.")
('Van', "But the bar's pretty damn low when you're drinking<br/>with this guy, so maybe don't judge me for gettin' a<br/>little jumpy here.")
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', 'Only relatively?')
('Harwood', "You're making it sound like he's some kind of deadly<br/>chemical that only turns into a threat when making<br/>contact with the wrong catalyst.")
('Harwood', "But heh. Don't you find that one funny, Arkride?")
('Van', "Stop being so smug about it when you're the<br/>damn catalyst!")
('Kincaid', 'Calm down, Van.')
('Kincaid', "While Marduk's chief of security is one thing, having<br/>one of the organization's highest-ranking<br/>members here...")
('Kincaid', 'You appearing publicly is certainly a problem for<br/>maintaining order.')
('Kincaid', 'Or it would be, normally.')
('Van', 'So then...')
('Harwood', "I'll be upfront with you. We came to...an agreement<br/>of sorts with a certain someone.")
('Harwood', "It's a short thing, no real meaning in the long run, but<br/>I wouldn't dare overstep my bounds. This time.")
('Harwood', 'And that agreement included giving you the hint you<br/>needed to destroy A over in Oración.')
('Van', '...!')
('Agnès', "Yeah. Just a hint, right?<br/>(An agreement with a 'certain someone'...)")
('Feri', "B-But that's all you did!")
('Aaron', 'Yeah, hint all right. And barely that.')
('Risette', 'I do recall your support extending just as far as that<br/>hint went, yes.')
('Quatre', 'Th-That barely helped, though!')
('Judith', "Yeah, it was just a hint! You don't get to be so smug<br/>about that!")
('Bergard', "...I hope you're not crazy enough to think we owe you<br/>for that.")
('Harwood', 'Hah, not a chance. It was just a matter of who knew<br/>more about A at the time.')
('Harwood', "Yeah, it was. You don't owe me for it, by the way.<br/>It was just a matter of who knew more about A at<br/>the time.")
('Harwood', 'What kicked off their mad death game with that<br/>incomplete nuclear weapon as a toy...')
('Harwood', '...and how they managed to assemble the crew they<br/>did in just twenty short years. Rounding, of course.')
('System', "You're talking about the society's knowledge in<br/>the regard. Or, well, yours.")
('System', 'So it boils down to what the society knows<br/>about them. Or you, rather.')
('Aaron', 'Okay, man. Toot your own horn if you want to.')
('Bergard', 'I thought something was off. It was your doing, then?')
('Van', "Oh, man. Is there nothin' you won't try turnin'<br/>into poison?")
('Van', "Far as I see it, you're just as bad as the one that<br/>brought in the Empire's Great Twilight.")
('Harwood', "Oh, not at all. I don't think I'm as amazing as all that.")
('Harwood', 'Besides, give or take about half of what I said was<br/>just a bluff.')
('Van', 'WHAT?!')
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', "What he's trying to say is they weren't the only people<br/>with control of the situation.")
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', "The CID, Heiyue, two of the church's factions, the<br/>Bracer Guild, and even Ikaruga and Marduk had<br/>influence over that situation.")
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', 'That is the influence these organizations were able to<br/>exert outside the scope of the game.')
('Kincaid', 'The result of their fair judgment is this: a convenient<br/>blind eye.')
('Kincaid', 'With that being said, our agreement will only last<br/>until the end of the festival.')
('Van', 'Got it...')
('Harwood', "Of course I've been in and out of the Blacklight<br/>District for a while, so it's more of a formality<br/>than anything.")
('Harwood', 'So come on, Khamsin, spectacled sadist. Drink up<br/>and enjoy!')
('Harwood', "We've got the winner of the game here, after all!<br/>Thanks for picking up the tab Arkride. Now<br/>bottoms up!")
('Van', "I'm going to WHAT?!")
('Kincaid', 'Well, in that case...')
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', "There's no reason to hold back.")
('Bermotti', "They already emptied a thirty year old<br/>vintage Rabelais. But it's okay, dear. I'll just add it to<br/>your tab.")
('Van', 'SCREW THAT NOISE!')
('Van', 'Shoot! They called in demons!')
('Shizuna', 'They must be trying to protect it!')
('System', 'Break the Demon Stone?')
('System', 'Break the Demon Stone?')
('System', 'Break the Demon Stone?')
('System', "Van's group decided to take a short break.")
('System', 'Everyone split up so they could spend their free time<br/>as they pleased.')
('Agnès', "*sigh* I guess I'll keep looking. I can't give up here...")
('Van', "Hey there. Funny seein' you here. You look mighty<br/>busy for someone who's supposed to be on break.")
('Agnès', 'Van!')
('Agnès', 'Heehee. Thank you for worrying.')
('Van', "I was just passin' by. Don't think too hard about it.")
('Van', "Though since I'm already here, I can always be a good<br/>boss, lend you an ear.")
('Agnès', 'Heehee. Thanks. I appreciate it.')
('Agnès', 'So, as it happens, I lost an important book of mine<br/>somewhere around here.')
('Agnès', "It's been weighing on me, so I've been coming back<br/>to look for it when I have some free time.")
('Van', 'What book did you lose?')
('Agnès', "It's a copy of one of the Sunshine Agnès volumes.<br/>You might've heard about them before.")
('Agnès', "It's very popular and still in print, so I could<br/>technically replace it if I wanted to.")
('Agnès', 'But the one I lost was a first edition print that I got as<br/>a gift from my parents ten years ago.')
('Agnès', "It's been with me for a long, long time.")
('Agnès', "And I don't want to just give up on it. It's a special<br/>book to me. I just...")
('Van', "Yeah, I get it. A thing stops being just a thing when it<br/>starts becomin' special to you. You just can't give it up<br/>like that.")
('Van', "Reminds me of when my favorite car's paint<br/>got scratched.")
('Agnès', 'Umm, right...')
('Agnès', "Though, maybe you're not too far off. It's<br/>funny, though. I hadn't paid that book much mind<br/>until now.")
('Agnès', 'I only realized it was really important to me once I<br/>lost it, I suppose.')
('Van', 'So? Any ideas on where it might be?')
('Agnès', 'Oh! Were you going to help me search?')
('Van', "Sure. I know you're keepin' it away from work by<br/>searchin' in your free time, but I still don't wanna see<br/>my assistant down in the dumps at all.")
('Van', "I don't work for free, though, but I guess I can give<br/>you an employee discount.")
('Agnès', 'Heehee. I appreciate it.')
('Agnès', 'With that said, I have no clue where it might be.')
('Agnès', 'I lost it the other day when I was out for a stroll. I was<br/>reading it at the time.')
('Agnès', "I retraced my steps multiple times and asked around<br/>all the stores I stopped at, but there's no sign of it.")
('Van', 'Well, that leaves a few possibilities, at least.')
('Van', "But let's make sure I have a clear picture of things.<br/>Mind if we retrace your steps one more time?")
('Agnès', 'Not at all. It might help just having another pair of<br/>eyes on it.')
('Van', 'Who knows? Now, where do we start?')
('System', 'Having finished shopping with a little time to spare...')
('System', '...Agnès decided to stop by Riverside to test her new<br/>art supplies.')
('Van', "Dunno why I'm even surprised an Aramis student<br/>would knock it out of the park with art, too.")
('Agnès', "All I'm really doing is applying what we learned<br/>in class.")
('Agnès', "But it's nice, spending an occasional off day painting<br/>like this.")
('Agnès', "The light reflecting off the river surface is beautiful,<br/>and the breeze feels quite nice. It's fun.")
('Van', 'Good to hear. Though painting the cityscape feels a<br/>fair bit advanced.')
('Agnès', 'Really? I feel like I see painters doing it all the time.')
('Agnès', "Come to think of it, Aramis the artist himself drew a<br/>number of Edith's cityscapes, I believe.")
('Agnès', "If I recall correctly, his earlier works depicted<br/>immigrants who'd been turned away from<br/>their homes.")
('Agnès', 'His later works depicted the streets of Edith after<br/>the Calvardian Revolution. The biggest constant<br/>is he always paints people, not just landscapes.')
('Van', "That's not a surprise, comin' from one of the main<br/>parties behind the revolution, and your<br/>school's founder.")
('Van', 'Though I also heard he was a real weirdo. As all<br/>artists tend to be.')
('Agnès', "Haha, I don't think you're far off. I've heard of his<br/>eccentricities in some of my classes.")
('Agnès', "But sitting here right now, painting the city landscape<br/>just as he did, helps me imagine what he might've<br/>thought of as he did this, too.")
('Agnès', "I can't help but think that he would've wanted the<br/>peaceful joy he painted on his canvas to reflect forever<br/>outside of it, too.")
('Van', 'You might not be far off there.')
(40302, 'Oh, no way! So, you know...')
(40301, "What? You're kidding!")
('Agnès', "Oh, they're Aramis students. They're probably on<br/>their way back home after their club activities.")
('Van', "Lemme know if I'm being rude or anything, but I<br/>kinda think you should've joined a club yourself.")
('Agnès', "I appreciate your concern, but I'm fine. I'm more than<br/>happy keeping busy after school and on the weekends<br/>with my part-time job.")
('Agnès', "It's taught me a great deal, just working with you and<br/>everyone at the office. And, needless to say, I enjoy it<br/>a lot, too.")
('Agnès', 'Of course, I do still make time to contribute to school<br/>activities when the time allows for it.')
('Van', "Well, if you're enjoyin' your student life, then there's<br/>no reason for me to butt in.")
('Van', "You're not the kind to neglect school and flunk out<br/>just 'cause of a part-time job.")
('Agnès', 'I agree there. I have always liked studying, to be<br/>frank, so it hardly feels like a burden.')
('Agnès', "I like organizing study groups in my free time.<br/>Studying with friends is surprisingly effective.<br/>There's always something new to learn from others.")
('Agnès', "You can never truly stop learning. It's hard at times,<br/>but it's also very rewarding.")
('Van', "Yeah, I trust you. Just don't go missin' out on quality<br/>time with your friends just 'cause you're busy with<br/>your job, okay?")
('Van', "The friends you make in school have the potential to<br/>be some of the best you'll ever make. And this is<br/>basically your only chance to ever do that.")
('Agnès', 'Oh. I...will keep that in mind.')
('Albert', "Ugh... I thought she said she was working a part time<br/>job, but they just went shopping and now they're<br/>even painting...")
('Albert', 'This is so suspicious... I need to look into this more.')
('System', 'Van and Agnès returned to their patrols after she was<br/>done with her painting.')
('System', 'Van left the office after the rain let up, gang member<br/>in tow.')
('System', "As he put it, there would be a major fight between<br/>gangs that had each team's very existence on the line.")
('System', "Van headed to the site of the conflict, concerned by<br/>the gang member's hopefully overwrought claims.")
(40301, "That's him! He's the one! Ahh! He's already<br/>kickin' ass!")
('Van', "Damn it. Of freakin' course.")
('Aaron', 'You took your sweet ass time getting here, you know!')
(40303, "Aaron, bro, you're amazing!")
(40304, "You're damn invincible!")
('Aaron', "Nah, these babies are just weak as shit. But<br/>that's okay. They're just the appetizer. Looks like the<br/>main course finally walked right in.")
('Van', "Had a feelin' it was you. For cryin' out loud...")
('Van', "I knew you were out, messin' around at night, but it<br/>didn't even cross my mind to think you'd be running<br/>with brats like these.")
('Aaron', "Hey, they're the ones that wanted to pick a fight with<br/>me when I was just chilling in the Tyrell District.")
('Aaron', 'I just taught them not to screw with me, but they<br/>practically up and begged me to be their boss.')
('Aaron', 'Who am I to say no? Especially since they asked<br/>so nicely. Thought I might as well keep an eye on<br/>them and lend a hand here and there.')
('Aaron', "And don't worry. I'm not stupid enough to get any<br/>outsiders wrapped up in this mess.")
(40301, 'Wait... My spriggan, my dude. You know him?!')
('Van', 'Unfortunately.')
('Aaron', "Whatever, man. You're here to help those chumps<br/>out, right?")
('Aaron', "Let's throw down already, then! Getting to hand you<br/>your ass will be the perfect cherry on top for<br/>the night!")
('Aaron', 'We got some unfinished business from back in<br/>Langport to settle. We never did get a clear winner<br/>out of those fights.')
(40301, "C'mon, bro! Show this red-haired idiot what's what!<br/>You got this—")
('Van', "Nah, I'm good.")
(40301, "What?! C'mon, bro! You said you were gonna<br/>help us!")
('Van', "I said I'd take a look. You're the one that jumped<br/>to conclusions.")
('Aaron', 'Man, you chickening out?')
('Van', "Ain't gettin' paid enough for this. Actually, I'm not<br/>gettin' paid at all. This pain in the ass ain't worth it.")
('Van', "Hell, aren't you twenty already? It's about damn time<br/>you stop foolin' around like you're just a kid.<br/>It's embarrassing.")
('Van', 'Later.')
('Aaron', '...Damn.')
(40301, 'Oh, no...')
(40305, "Hell yeah! You're the best, bro!")
(40303, "That means Riverside's our turf now!")
(40303, "Now, it's time for the curtain call!")
(40303, 'Wha—?!')
(40304, 'Y-You blocked it?!')
(40301, "The hell?! You're on the same team!")
('Aaron', "I'm not an idiot, you know. I saw this coming<br/>ages ago. You just wanted me to clean house, right<br/>from the start.")
('Aaron', "All so you'd get to expand your territory and<br/>assimilate the punks from this district before handing<br/>them over to some bigger gang.")
('Aaron', 'Just another job for you, right? But you should know<br/>dealing with me is way above your pay grade.')
(40304, 'Y-You knew the whole plan?!')
(40303, "Come on, don't get scared now! He's the only one<br/>remaining—")
('Van', 'Yeah... No.')
(40304, 'What?!')
(40301, 'Spriggan, my dude!')
('Aaron', "Thought you'd gone home already.")
('Van', "Nah. I'm the adult around here, and that means I<br/>gotta keep an eye on y'all and make sure you kids<br/>don't do something stupid.")
('Van', "Don't act so surprised, though. You knew what I was<br/>up to already.")
('Aaron', 'Yeah. What do you think of my distraction game?')
('Van', 'Cocky as always.')
('Van', "Anyway. You kids are in for some real tough shit if<br/>you keep this up. It's one thing to get into a smalltime<br/>gang or whatever.")
('Van', "But getting involved with real gangsters crosses<br/>the line. I can't ignore that anymore.")
('Aaron', "You ain't gettin' your ass out of this one. You screwed<br/>yourselves over the second you even looked at 'em.")
(40304, "I-I don't need a lecture from you, asshole!")
(40305, 'You two might be strong, but we win in numbers!')
(40305, "Come on, show them who's boss!")
('Aaron', 'In one ear and out the other. Might as well have some<br/>fun, then!')
('Van', 'Time to teach you a lesson!')
(40305, 'Argh...')
(40304, "Th-They're so strong...")
(40301, "You two're AMAZING! You fought all of them off<br/>without breaking a sweat!")
('Aaron', "Are all of Edith's punks this shitty? 'Cause these guys<br/>could barely put up a fight.")
('Aaron', "I'm sure as hell not getting involved with any more of<br/>these smalltime gangsters.")
('Aaron', 'Wanna help me clean up this mess, old fart?')
('Van', 'Gonna charge you extra just for that.')
('System', 'Afterwards, the persistent conflict between the two<br/>local gangs came to a close.')
('System', 'Van and Aaron left the scene after sending an<br/>anonymous tip to the police, leaving them to handle<br/>the rest.')
('Van', "Not gonna lie. Got my suspicions when I heard you<br/>were gettin' involved with some local street<br/>punks here.")
('Van', "Worried you were tryin' to build a replacement for<br/>the crew you lost in Langport.")
('Aaron', "Nah, man, I wouldn't do that. There's no way I could<br/>replace them.")
('Aaron', "But, like...yeah, those punks were pretty nasty, but<br/>they weren't rotten to their cores. Not yet, anyway.")
('Aaron', "They just didn't know any other way to live. And I<br/>don't believe not knowing any better's a grave enough<br/>crime to damn them forever.")
('Van', 'So you decided to get involved to fix things?')
('Van', "All for some group of Edith punks you barely knew...<br/>Well, shit could've gone worse, I guess.")
('Aaron', "You're thinking too hard about it. I wasn't trying to<br/>play nice like that.")
('Van', "Sure, sure. We'll stick with that if it helps you sleep at<br/>night, kid.")
('Aaron', 'Tch...')
('System', 'Aaron soon left, planning to enjoy the city at night<br/>for a while longer before heading back.')
('System', 'After that, Van returned to his nightly patrol.')
('System', 'Van received a call from Judith.')
('System', "Together they headed to the site of Grimcat's<br/>supposed latest heist.")
('Judith', 'Thank you for coming, Van.')
('Van', "Don't sweat it. If something's bugging you, better<br/>take care of it ASAP.")
('Van', 'So, what are we looking at? Is this where<br/>Grimcat hit?')
('Judith', 'You mean the FAKE Grimcat!')
('Judith', 'There was this fake calling card left behind.')
('System', "'The Phantom Thief Grimcat has stolen<br/>your treasure!'")
('Van', "It's just chicken scratch on a dirty piece of paper.")
('Judith', 'I know, right? RIGHT?! Talk about disrespect!')
('Judith', "If they're going to go around, posing as me, they<br/>could AT LEAST put some effort into it!<br/>Like matching the stationery at least!")
('Van', "That really what's botherin' you here? Actually, no.<br/>How'd you even get that in the first place?")
('Judith', 'After tracing their steps, I was able to predict where<br/>they would strike next. Sort of...')
('Judith', 'I got here after the fact, but I did manage to beat the<br/>cops by a bit.')
('Van', 'No small fry if they can shake you off, at least.')
('Judith', "Yeah... They've got the acrobatics to match, at least.")
('Judith', "But I'm sure it's just a matter of time before I catch<br/>up, though! So I figured I'd call in the cavalry, just<br/>in case!")
('System', 'Van and Judith set off in pursuit of the fake Grimcat.')
('System', "Judith's investigation suggested the fake Grimcat<br/>would strike multiple targets in one night.")
('System', 'Their goal was to catch the fake Grimcat before they<br/>struck again.')
('System', "Van decided to stop by Bermotti's place during his<br/>nightly patrol.")
('Bermotti', 'Oh! Van, darling, welcome.')
('Bermotti', 'Which Bermotti are you looking for tonight?<br/>The informant, or the bartender?')
('Bermotti', "I can pull double duty if you're feeling a little<br/>needy, too!")
('Van', "That's a weird way to ask 'do you want a drink.'")
('Van', "Which is what I'm here for, by the way. Figured I'd<br/>have a quick drink while out and about.")
('Van', 'Surprise me.')
('Bermotti', "All righty! I'll get you just the perfect drink for a dark<br/>and rainy night.")
('Bermotti', 'By the by, we happen to have an unusual<br/>customer today.')
('Van', 'An unusual customer? Who—')
('Fie', 'Hey, Van.')
('Fie', 'Want to sit with me tonight?')
('Bermotti', "Here you go. It's called Rainy Blue. Perfect for<br/>tonight's weather.")
('Bermotti', 'Have fun, you two. ♪')
('Fie', "It's a nice drink.")
('Van', "Yeah. You okay to be out drinkin'?")
('Fie', "I may still look like a teen, but I'm twenty as of<br/>this year.")
('Fie', 'How about you?')
('Van', "Twenty-four. And I don't wanna hear any comments<br/>about it. I'm not that old.")
('Fie', 'You telling me not to only makes me want to do it<br/>even more.')
('Van', "Anyway. Since we're already here, we might as well.<br/>Cheers.")
('Fie', "Sure. Here's to making friends. Cheers.")
('System', 'Van and Fie shared a few drinks, opening with a bit<br/>of pleasant small talk.')
('System', 'After ten minutes of drinks...')
('Fie', '...')
('Van', "Come on, you barely had anything. Don't tell me<br/>you're blackout drunk already.")
('Fie', "I'm not. Just felt a little sleepy there.")
('Van', "You don't gotta force yourself to drink if you can't<br/>take it. I ain't gonna look after you if you DO<br/>black out.")
('Fie', "*yawn* I'll be fine. Just need to take a short nap.")
('Fie', "And I'm familiar with what a truly embarrassing<br/>drunk looks like. I can keep myself from falling into<br/>the same rut as Sara.")
('Van', 'Sara? As in Valestein? The Purple Lightning?')
('Van', "A former jaeger turned A-rank bracer. Just like you.<br/>She also had somethin' to do with Class VII, if I<br/>remember right.")
('Fie', "I guess it's your job to be well informed.")
('Fie', "She started out as our class teacher. Now, she's both<br/>my master and my partner. Of sorts, anyway.")
('Fie', 'Come to think of it, I had some good drinks with<br/>Rean, Laura, and the others on my birthday, too.')
('Van', 'Master and partner, huh...')
('Fie', 'Do you have someone like that?')
('Van', 'Sort of. Master, yes. But not partner.')
('Van', "Not that different at the end of the day, though.<br/>I wouldn't be where I am today without him.")
('Van', "But that tie's been cut now.")
('Fie', 'I see.')
('Fie', '...')
('Van', "Anyway, that's enough about me. You got somethin'<br/>you wanted to ask, yeah?")
('Van', "Since you went to the trouble of waitin' for me here<br/>and all.")
('Fie', "Should've guessed you'd figure it out.")
('Fie', 'Zin told me something right before I arrived at<br/>the Republic.')
('Fie', 'He filled me in on what happened in Creil.')
('Fie', 'You were there for it, right? With the Kruga girl I<br/>met at the park.')
('Van', "We were, yeah. Guess it's not surprising you'd wanna<br/>hear about what happened.")
('Van', "We might be here a bit, but I don't mind sharin'.")
('System', 'Van started telling Fie about what happened in Creil<br/>Village, making sure to omit the subject of<br/>the Genesis.')
('System', 'He told an intently listening Fie about what occurred<br/>in the village and everything relating to Aida.')
('Fie', 'I see. Aida...')
('Fie', 'She never changed. She always played the role of big<br/>sister, even back with our old crew.')
('Fie', 'I definitely saw her as one.')
('Fie', 'She was probably happy to have her little sister with<br/>her for her last moments.')
('Fie', "Thank you for telling me about it. I'll make sure Xeno<br/>and Leo hear about it, too.")
('Van', 'Yeah, you do that.')
('Van', 'So you still keep in touch with the guys from Zephyr?')
('Fie', '*yawn* A bit, at least...')
('Fie', 'I lost contact with them for a few years after what<br/>happened to the boss.')
('Fie', "But they're still family to me. I kept in contact with<br/>them this time, after everything settled down.")
('Van', "That's good.")
('Van', '(Heard here and there that the Jaeger King was<br/>somehow involved in the whole war deal<br/>with Erebonia.)')
('Van', "(Probably shouldn't pry.)")
('Fie', 'But, hmm... Ferida, from the Warriors of Kruga.')
('Fie', "I'd like to talk to her about Aida. And in general, too.<br/>It'd be nice to chat with her outside of work.")
('Van', "Don't see why not. Feri looked like she wanted to<br/>talk to you, too.")
('Fie', "That's good to hear. But it'll probably have to wait<br/>until things calm down.")
('Fie', "Still, it'll be nice to get to talk to one of Aida's<br/>other sisters.")
('Fie', 'Oh. Right. When I meet her... My dad...')
('Fie', '...')
('Van', 'Uhh... You okay there?')
('Fie', '...Zzz...')
('Van', "Hah. Well, guess that's the end of that conversation.")
('Van', "She said she'd only take a short nap, so I guess I'll<br/>leave her be.")
('System', "Van, leaving Fie in Bermotti's care, left the bar.")
('System', 'He received word shortly after that Fie had woken up<br/>and headed off herself.')
(40301, "Heh, think I managed to lose 'em.")
(40301, "Just my luck that the cops just happened to be there.<br/>But what's done is—")
(40301, 'GAH!')
('Van', "Whoa. You sure went flyin'. You okay there, bud?")
(40301, 'Oww... Damn it, who the hell are you?! The hell was<br/>that all about?')
('Van', "Whoops. Sorry, man. You looked so easy to trip up, I<br/>couldn't help myself.")
('Van', 'Anyway, stay quiet. Aaany minute now...')
('Detective Nate', 'Inspector, over there!')
(40301, 'The damn cops!')
('Van', 'Good work, officers!')
('Detective Nate', '*pant* *pant* Wh... Why are you here?!')
('Inspector Daswani', "You took him down, didn't you?")
('Van', "Not at all! Let's just call it dumb luck. Glad you could<br/>apprehend the culprit, officers.")
(40301, 'D-Damn it all!')
('Detective Nate', 'And so we brought the case of the Brothers Music<br/>Shop thief to an end.')
('Detective Nate', "That's another one for the books... NOT! Is this<br/>a joke?!")
('Detective Nate', 'What is with you?! How did you even get ahead<br/>of us?!')
('Detective Nate', "And if you were going to help, why didn't you do it<br/>from the start?!")
('Van', "Because you wouldn't owe me if I'd just up and<br/>offered my help.")
('Van', "Here's a tip, buddy: You really gotta learn Edith's<br/>backstreets if you wanna make it as a cop here.")
('Detective Nate', 'Grr...')
('Inspector Daswani', "We were also able to assist the old lady thanks to<br/>some 'good-hearted citizen's tip.'")
('Inspector Daswani', "Her family's on the way to pick her up, so she should<br/>be fine from here on.")
('Van', "Oh? Dunno what you're talkin' about, but good<br/>for you.")
('Van', "Well, then, officers. Don't wanna stand in the way of<br/>all your peacekeepin', so I'll leave you be.")
('Detective Nate', "Goddamn it. What's he even trying to get at?")
('Inspector Daswani', "I suppose that's just how a spriggan does things.")
('Inspector Daswani', "Not to say that he's earned my trust just with this,<br/>of course.")
('Detective Nate', 'Huh?')
('Inspector Daswani', "Nothing. Let's get back to the station.")
('System', 'The robber was escorted to the police station.')
('System', 'Once things calmed down, Van returned to his<br/>nightly patrol.')
('Aaron', 'Well, I got some time to kill. What to do, hmm...')
('Aaron', "Maybe I'll stop by for a bit of booze while the sun's<br/>still up, and then some cuties for when it goes<br/>down—")
('Ashen', "So this is where you've been, Aaron.")
('Van', 'You look awfully relaxed for someone who just<br/>ditched all his responsibilities on me.')
('Aaron', 'Why are you here?!')
('Ashen', "It's not that hard to guess what you get up to.<br/>How come you canceled on me last minute?!")
('Ashen', "You haven't been causing trouble for everyone, right?<br/>I so know you messed up your sleeping schedule<br/>again, and I bet your diet's not far off.")
('Aaron', '(Oh, you did NOT just come all this way to have her<br/>nag at me!)')
('Van', "(You were askin' for it.)")
('System', 'Van and Ashen took Aaron around town, having him<br/>serve as her tour guide for the day.')
('System', 'After ending their tour at Trion Tower, they returned<br/>to the Seiden District.')
('System', 'Van headed to the meetup location indicated by<br/>the mail.')
('Prince Sherid', 'Van. Van? Over here.')
('Prince Sherid', 'My thanks for coming out here.')
('Prince Sherid', "It's been a few hours, yes? Thank you for answering<br/>my call.")
('Van', 'Why...are you hiding there?')
('Van', "I know you're good with arts and everything, but<br/>don't you have your right hand with you? Or even<br/>just one bodyguard?")
('Prince Sherid', 'As I wrote to you, I managed to lose them for<br/>a moment.')
('Prince Sherid', "Shall we be off, then? Let us share the night as men,<br/>savoring all the dazzling delights of Edith's nightlife!")
('Van', 'Already kind of regretting this...')
('Van', 'You sure it was okay for you to slip out like that?')
('Prince Sherid', "I guess that's up to you, isn't it?")
('Prince Sherid', 'Given the situation, if by some off chance something<br/>were to happen to me, I dare say the obvious person<br/>to hold responsible would be...')
('Van', "Scratch that. I don't just kind of regret this. I wanna<br/>erase all evidence that this ever happened and then<br/>book it outta here.")
('Prince Sherid', "Now, now. Don't be like that. There's no one better<br/>to fulfill this role than you.")
('Prince Sherid', 'Think of this as a symbol of my trust.')
('Van', 'Fine. Where do you wanna go, anyway?')
('Prince Sherid', "Excellent. You're everything I'd hoped for, Van.")
('Prince Sherid', "I've marked a few places I was hoping to visit.<br/>The one closest by would be—")
('Prince Sherid', "Oh, excellent! Excellent! So this is the 'rock and roll'<br/>that's been so popular lately!")
('Prince Sherid', 'I dare say the fervor of this music could even sweep<br/>me away.')
('Van', 'We can get closer to the stage.')
('Prince Sherid', 'Then let us do so.')
(40301, "Hey, man! That's a wild getup! This your first time at<br/>a live show?")
(40301, "C'mon, man, get into the rhythm! Just match the<br/>energy and go wild!")
('Prince Sherid', 'Go...wild?')
('Prince Sherid', '(So, like this?)')
('Van', '...')
('Bermotti', 'Hello there, Van, dear. You, too, Agnès!')
('Bermotti', "It's wonderful seeing you two together again.")
('Van', 'Yeah. Long story short, I guess I hired myself a<br/>new assistant.')
('Van', "Figured we'd drop by for a proper greeting.")
('Agnès', "Once again, it's a pleasure to meet you.")
('Bermotti', "The pleasure's all mine, darling.")
('Bermotti', "How's your first day on the job treating you? I'm sure<br/>it's going to be hard work!")
('Bermotti', "But if you need to relax after a hard day of work,<br/>you're always welcome here!")
('Agnès', 'Thank you very much!')
('Bermotti', "Oh, you might've guessed already since you're here,<br/>but I'm also open throughout the day, too. Feel free<br/>to drop by for lunch, if you'd like.")
('Van', 'Sounds good. We might drop by for that, and<br/>some info.')
('Agnès', "There's a bulletin board here, too? It looks like it gets<br/>a lot of use.")
('Van', 'That it does, yeah.')
('Van', "Let's focus on this case for now.")
('Agnès', '...?')
('System', "It's an old jukebox.")
('System', 'Enter the Underground Maintenance Tunnel?')
('Van', 'I should meet up with everyone first.')
('Van', "I shouldn't be goin' in without any business.")
('Van', "I shouldn't be goin' in without any business.")
('System', 'Travel to the Blacklight District via the Subway<br/>Service Path?')
('Van', "The concert hall... It usually isn't open during<br/>the day.")
