('Agnès', "At the time, the anti-immigrant sentiment wasn't<br/>quite as strong.")
('Agnès', "Professor Hamilton's proposal was quickly accepted<br/>by the Institute of Science and the Artisanal District.")
('Albert', "And so forty-five years ago, the Institute of Science<br/>and the Artisans' Guild came together to establish the<br/>Verne Company.")
('Albert', 'They then went on to further orbal technology in<br/>new, innovative ways.')
('Odette', 'Right. Like how Calvard and the Verne Company<br/>were the first to develop orbal cars.')
('Odette', 'That eventually led to the four big car manufacturers<br/>being established as affiliated companies.')
('Renne', 'And while Calvard pioneered orbal cars, the Empire<br/>was the first one to develop orbal trains, and Liberl<br/>the first to develop orbal airships.')
('Renne', "It's amazing, the kinds of things a little research<br/>uncovers about the history of something<br/>so commonplace.")
('Julian', "All good to know, too. I'll have to keep it all in mind<br/>for my report.")
('Chignon', "And we're not even done, because all that links to the<br/>development of films!")
('James', "Hmm... Isn't this all a bit too simple for a topic?")
('Sasha', "Aww. Don't be like that.")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', '(Heehee. Oh, to be a student again. When I was<br/>their age...)')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "(Wait! I'm only twenty-one! I'm not an old pile of<br/>bones yet!)")
('Lyle', '...Our hot-ass president, Roy Gramheart!')
('Chignon', "Heehee! It's funny hearing you say it out loud, but<br/>yeah, he IS pretty hot for his age, huh?")
('Julian', "He's become a big name even in the Empire. For a...<br/>variety of reasons.")
('Agnès', "...I'm sure.")
('Odette', 'Well, that just goes to show how big a deal he is on<br/>an international scale.')
('Albert', "Yeah. For how difficult things were at the end of the<br/>war, he's done a pretty stellar job of steering our ship.")
('Renne', '(Heehee...)')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', '(It is true that the current government is handling<br/>things extremely well.)')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "(But that's more because...)")
