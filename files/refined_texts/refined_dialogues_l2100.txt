('Van', "Still not sure you should've come along for the<br/>ride, Agnès.")
('Van', "I know you've got three days off, but the new term<br/>started, didn't it? What, you got no work to do?")
('Agnès', "I just didn't want to be the only one left out.")
('Agnès', "The Geneses seem to be involved in this somehow,<br/>too, so it could be there's a role here that only I<br/>can play.")
('Agnès', "And I applied for permission to be off campus for a<br/>few days last night, so don't worry—I'm not breaking<br/>any rules!")
('Van', 'You thought this through WAY too hard!')
('Van', '...Aramis has always been way too lax with rules for<br/>such a big-name academy.')
('Agnès', 'Hmm?')
('Feri', "Umm... So if you're going to such a famous academy,<br/>why are you working for Mr. Arkride?")
('Feri', 'Is it a part-time job?')
('Agnès', "That's right. I've only just started, though.")
('Van', "And I didn't have much say in the matter.")
('Van', "Oh, and Ferida—'Van' is fine.")
('Van', "I'm gettin' paid for this, so you're my client. No need<br/>to be polite.")
('Feri', 'B-But...')
('Feri', "...Okay. But only if you call me 'Feri.'")
('Van', 'Hmm? Sure. If that works for you.')
('Agnès', 'Heehee.')
('Agnès', "If you're thirteen, then you must attend Sunday<br/>School at the temple, right?")
('Feri', "Yeah. I started senior classes this year. They're a lot<br/>harder than what I'm used to...")
('Feri', "Oh, but the temples here aren't the same as the ones I<br/>know, I think?")
('Agnès', "That's right. We have churches and chapels instead,<br/>though they serve the same purpose.")
('Agnès', 'But there ARE temples for worship in Calvard, too.')
('Van', 'You got Arusha, the Winged Goddess, in the Central<br/>East, and Aidios, the Sky Goddess, in the West.')
('Van', "They're believed to be one and the same even if the<br/>names're different, though.")
('Van', "She's even got another name if you go farther east.")
('Feri', 'Oh! Yeah! Aida told me about that!')
('Feri', "It feels like there's so much out there for me to learn...")
('Agnès', 'Heehee.')
('Agnès', 'Still, it sounds like Aida taught you a lot.')
('Feri', "She did. Not just about fighting, but about different<br/>places across the continent, what's popular in<br/>those places...")
('Feri', "I know this'll sound weird after I've already asked you<br/>to find her...")
('Feri', "...but I still can't believe her corps would just<br/>disappear the way it did.")
('Feri', "They're all hardened jaegers who have always been<br/>able to handle anything thrown their way.")
('Agnès', "Your friend from the CID called her the Flameeater,<br/>didn't he?")
('Van', 'Yeah. Pretty well-known name among jaegers.')
('Van', 'They say she uses surgical precision with knives and<br/>gunfire to cut through enemy morale and momentum.')
('Van', 'She joined Eisenschild five years ago after her old<br/>corps disbanded, I think?')
('Feri', 'That sounds about right.')
('Agnès', 'She was in another corps?')
('Feri', 'She was! A really famous one, too.')
('Feri', 'It was called Zephyr and was one of the two biggest<br/>jaeger corps in the West.')
('Feri', 'It was made up of a small number of combat<br/>specialists, the Jaeger King being its head.')
('Feri', 'And Aida used to lead one of their units.')
('Feri', 'But after the Jaeger King died five years ago, the<br/>whole corps fell apart.')
('Feri', 'That was when she moved on to Eisenschild.')
('Agnès', "This is all so interesting... I didn't realize jaeger corps<br/>could have such a rich history.")
('Van', "Zephyr's still around, by the way—just in a<br/>different form.")
('Van', "But yeah, their rep back in the day was somethin' else.")
('Van', "I can't see someone who used to be with 'em going<br/>down easily.")
('Feri', 'So you think so, too?')
('Feri', "But if she's fine, then why hasn't she made contact<br/>with the rest of her corps?")
('Feri', 'Ugh... All of this is making my head hurt.')
('Agnès', "D-Don't worry! We'll find her for you.")
('Agnès', "Even if she isn't in Creil, I'm sure we'll find some clue<br/>that will take us to her.")
('Agnès', 'You told us how deep your bond with her goes...')
('Agnès', 'That alone will surely draw the two of you<br/>back together.')
('Agnès', "Where there's a will, there's a way—and Van and I<br/>have the will to find you a way!")
('Feri', 'You mean it...?')
('Feri', "Well, thank you! I'll be counting on you both!")
('Van', 'Heh.')
('Van', "(Thinkin' about it, I might've had some indirect<br/>involvement with Aida two years back.)")
('Van', '(She chose to go against her old home and help our<br/>side back then.)')
('Van', '(It makes no sense that someone of her skill would up<br/>and vanish. And with a Genesis maybe involved...)')
('Van', "(There's gotta be more to this than there seems.)")
('Van', "(The only question's whether she went dark by her<br/>own volition...)")
('Feri', "*yaaawn*... Sorry. Didn't mean to yawn so loud.")
('Van', "It's okay to go to sleep if you wanna get some<br/>shuteye, y'know.")
('Van', "The seats all recline, so you should be able to<br/>get comfy. Just make sure your seatbelt's nice and<br/>tight first.")
('Agnès', "None of us would mind if you got some rest, too, by<br/>the way. We've passed a number of pit stops already.")
('Van', "Ahh, don't worry 'bout me. I'm used to long drives<br/>like these.")
('Van', "If I really need it that bad, I'll just let this little punk<br/>take over.")
('Aaron', "Works for me—I'm still young, so I can actually<br/>DO all-nighters.")
('Feri', "*yaaawn*... Oh! I've been meaning to ask.")
('Feri', "Do people really not drink camel's milk in<br/>the Republic?")
('Agnès', 'Was it the story about the melfita that made you want<br/>to ask?')
('Agnès', "But that's right. You don't see camels much outside of<br/>the Central East.")
('Aaron', 'Did you used to drink it back home or something?')
('Feri', "Nope. Our village is at the base of a mountain, so we<br/>don't keep any camels back home, either.")
('Feri', "I've just had some during a few of our trips.")
('Feri', "It tasted so good, though! It's much thicker than cow<br/>and sheep's milk.")
('Aaron', "Huh. I wonder if it's like kumis. That's good stuff.")
('Agnès', 'You make me want to try it now! Heehee.')
('Van', "Camel's milk is supposed to be really valuable since<br/>they don't produce much of it.")
('Van', "Never tried any myself, but it's supposed to be a good<br/>alternative for people who're allergic to cow's milk.")
('Van', "It's much higher in protein, vitamins, and iron, while<br/>at the same time much lower in fat content.")
('Van', "They also say it's tough to bake with, though, so<br/>kinda surprising that someone would try makin'<br/>chocolate with it.")
('Aaron', 'You are an encyclopedia for the weirdest shit...')
('Aaron', "You guys hauled your asses over to Langport 'cause<br/>Cao bribed him with sweets, too, right? We are so<br/>screwed if Almata learns his weak point.")
('Agnès', 'Y-You make a good point...')
('Feri', "I...guess we'll have to learn how to make even nicer<br/>confections to keep him loyal to us?")
('Van', "I can't ALWAYS be bought, you know...")
('Agnès', "Changing topics, Nina seems like such a lovely<br/>person on top of her already being a talented actress,<br/>doesn't she?")
('Agnès', "She's only two years older than me, but she's so<br/>composed and levelheaded.")
('Feri', 'Yeah. She stood her ground even when those<br/>monsters all showed up.')
('Feri', "She's not a warrior, but she did have this noble kinda<br/>aura to her.")
('Van', 'Yeah. Quite a woman.')
('Van', "Not much like your average Easterner, either. I don't<br/>think she's from Langport, is she?")
('Aaron', "No, but it's not like every Easterner in this part of the<br/>world comes from Langport.")
('Aaron', "We've got Longlai in Eastern Calvard and a<br/>place like the Eastern Quarter over in Crossbell<br/>out west, to name two big hubs.")
('Aaron', "And she's deliberately gone out of her way to present<br/>herself as more white, too.")
('Aaron', "Not judging, to make it clear. That's her call to make.")
('Feri', "I'm confused. I feel like I'm missing something...")
('Agnès', "It's...a bit of a Calvard problem. A delicate one.")
('Agnès', 'After the revolution a hundred years ago,<br/>discrimination on the basis of identity, race, and<br/>culture were all abolished.')
('Agnès', 'Our constitution makes it possible for us all to live<br/>in harmony with one another.')
('Agnès', 'And to a certain extent, we do—at least on<br/>the surface.')
('Feri', "Oh... Do you mean all the racial terrorism that's<br/>been happening?")
('Aaron', 'Prejudice runs reeeal deep in Calvard.')
('Aaron', "There isn't much over in Langport, but up north?<br/>Hoo, boy.")
('Aaron', "You got white supremacists stuck in Calvard's past<br/>who raised some hell with Easterners—and Central<br/>Easterners sometimes, too.")
('Aaron', "Things came to a head when Crossbell tried declaring<br/>its independence and during the economic crises that<br/>followed, but it's calmed down some since.")
('Agnès', "Though that's only because Calvard's been basking in<br/>the prosperity of the Empire's reparations.")
('Agnès', "It isn't as if racism itself has disappeared.")
('Feri', "It's too bad that's not the case...")
('Aaron', "Course, Heiyue's never taken it lying down. They hit<br/>back hard.")
('Aaron', "So there's that, too. It's not all one-sided.")
('Van', "Huh. That's a pretty mature take for you.")
('Aaron', "Oh, shut up. I just hate stereotypes, that's all.")
('Agnès', "I agree with you there. We're all individuals.")
('Agnès', "It's just a shame that a lot of people in this world can't<br/>see others that way...")
('Feri', '...')
('Van', 'Central Easterners have a lot of mira, so that adds to<br/>the friction, too.')
('Van', "They've contributed a good amount to Calvard's<br/>development in technology and academics.")
('Van', 'Their investments are a large reason why Verne and<br/>the Basel Institute of Science have become as big as<br/>they are.')
('Agnès', "And it's not just financial investments. It's well<br/>known that one of my great-grandfather's three<br/>disciples has a Central Eastern background.")
('Agnès', 'Professor Hamilton, if you know her name.')
('Feri', "Oh! Yeah, I've heard of her before!")
('Feri', "Still...it's sad to think that there are those out there<br/>who hate any contribution made just because of the<br/>people who made it.")
('Feri', "I guess I've still got a lot to learn about this<br/>country, huh?")
('Agnès', 'Feri...')
('Aaron', '...')
('Van', "The younger crowd doesn't really dwell as much on<br/>where people come from, though.")
('Van', 'I say keep it that way as you grow.')
('Van', "Us oldies will be watchin' over you with pride as we<br/>sip our tea.")
('Feri', 'Van...')
('Agnès', "You're not much older than us, you know...")
('Aaron', "Heh. Don't throw out your back just yet, gramps.")
('Aaron', "It's the job of your generation to pave the road ahead<br/>so we can have a smoother ride.")
('Van', "You pave your own damn road! And callin' me an old<br/>fart is bad enough!")
('Van', "(Man... They're a tough bunch, but they all look their<br/>age when they're asleep.)")
('Van', '(Hard to believe we used to be like this, too.)')
('Van', "These are some troubled times, and I know you've all<br/>got a lot more to worry about than you'd ever let on...")
('Van', "...but I hope you'll never lose sight of how to live your<br/>life your own way.")
('Van', "...So you don't go off the rails like I did.")
('Van', 'The war two years ago and the leadup to it was a big<br/>turning point in tech across the continent, too.')
('Van', 'The major powers were locked in a heated arms race<br/>with each other. The Empire even ended up creating<br/>these giant robots.')
('Aaron', 'Those Panzer Soldat things? Yeah.')
('Feri', "I've seen them in person before, and I couldn't believe<br/>what I was seeing.")
('Risette', 'Wars accelerate the birth of new technology, and that<br/>new technology in turn spurs on yet more wars.')
('Risette', "Liberl's airships are an excellent example of that,<br/>since they were first developed in response to a war<br/>between it and the Empire.")
('Aaron', 'Anyway, it was pretty clear tech-wise that the Empire<br/>was ahead of the Republic during the war.')
('Aaron', "Calvard's back on top now, though.")
('Van', 'Yeah. The reparations and desire to not be<br/>one-upped by the Empire again more than fueled<br/>that fire.')
('Van', "That's what inspired our Xiphas and the installation<br/>of the orbal network all across the country.")
('Van', "Word is our military weaponry's got a massive<br/>overhaul in store soon, too.")
('Van', 'And the one aggressively advancing all that is...')
('Van', 'Either way, large influxes of mira and major changes<br/>on the world stage often manifest as distortions<br/>in society.')
('Van', "I dunno whether that fact's got anything to do with<br/>what we're going to investigate—")
('Feri', "—but try to sniff around for signs of trouble while<br/>we're there, right?")
('Aaron', "Miss Perfect's thing shone when we were talking<br/>about the place. We already know there's trouble<br/>going in.")
('Risette', 'We will be on the lookout for anything we can glean<br/>regarding the many major ongoing projects in<br/>the city...')
('Risette', "...as well as ready to 'sniff out' any significant groups<br/>and organizations that may be at work.")
('Feri', 'Right! Together with Agnès, too!')
('Van', "I didn't even have to say anything, huh? Yeah, you're<br/>right on.")
('Aaron', 'Out like a light already, huh?')
('Agnès', "Well, it was an early morning for her. I'm not<br/>surprised she's tired.")
('Risette', "It's almost 9AM. You said we would be arriving<br/>around 12:30, if I recall?")
('Van', "Somewhere around there, yeah. Since we got Yumé<br/>with us, I'm plannin' to make a couple pit stops along<br/>the way.")
('Feri', "Oh? I wonder who's calling.")
('Van', "Huh. I don't recognize this number, either.")
('Nina', 'Hello. Sorry for calling you so early in the morning.')
('Van', 'Well, this is a surprise.')
('Agnès', 'Nina!')
('Quatre', "Isn't she...?")
('Feri', "She's an actress we handled a job for a while ago.")
('Nina', "Oh! I didn't expect everyone to be with you.<br/>Wait—are you on the road?")
('Van', "Yeah, but we're on a major one, so we can get a<br/>decent enough signal.")
('Van', "We're actually gonna be outta town for a few days.<br/>You didn't have another job for us, did you?")
('Nina', "O-Oh, not quite. I really don't want to impose on<br/>you, either.")
('Van', "Well, why don't you just tell us what's up?<br/>Can't guarantee we'll be able to help, but I'd still like<br/>to hear you out before saying for sure.")
('Nina', '...All right. Thank you.')
('Nina', "It's about Judith, you see.")
('Nina', "We haven't been able to get in contact with her for a<br/>few days now.")
('Van', '...Really?')
('Agnès', "D-Do you think that's because...?")
('Aaron', "It's gotta be because of that story getting around.")
('Nina', "That's what I was thinking, too.")
('Nina', "It's completely fabricated, so I wouldn't have expected<br/>her to get worked up about it...")
('Nina', "...but the timing sets off a red flag. That's why I was<br/>hoping to ask you to look for her.")
('Quatre', "This is Judith Lanster we're talking about, right?<br/>She's always struck me as the kind of person who'd let<br/>nothing get her down.")
('Quatre', 'Maybe the more someone appears to be that way, the<br/>more sensitive they are deep down?')
('Feri', "Hmm... No. She's this super hardheaded lady who<br/>doesn't know when to quit.")
('Agnès', 'F-Feri...')
('Aaron', "Heh. Yeah, her outfit sure doesn't know when to quit.")
('Nina', '...Hmm? What outfit?')
('Van', 'Oh, just ignore them.')
('Van', "If she's still missing when we get back to the capital<br/>the day after tomorrow, we'll see what we can do.")
('Van', "Until then, I'll give some of my contacts a call and<br/>check if they've heard anything.")
('Risette', 'I would also be happy to look into what I can find on<br/>the orbal network.')
('Nina', 'Oh, that sounds like more than enough! Thank<br/>you both.')
('Agnès', "Umm... I don't think you should worry about her too<br/>much, though. Especially since we all know that<br/>article is made up.")
('Agnès', "But if we learn anything, we'll be sure to let you know<br/>as soon as we can.")
('Nina', 'Thank you, really. I appreciate you being<br/>so accommodating.')
('Aaron', "Seriously, though, that kinkster's tough as nails.<br/>I'm sure she's fine.")
('Feri', "You said you ran into her last weekend, didn't<br/>you, Van?")
('Van', "Yeah. She was lookin' for proof that Maxim was<br/>involved in a crime.")
('Van', "Seemed to get real down after I told her her<br/>suspicions about him couldn't be more off.")
('Quatre', "'Kinkster'? And what kind of crime?")
('Quatre', "I'm having trouble following this conversation...")
('Risette', "That's hardly surprising.")
('Agnès', "Ahaha... It's not that important, but hopefully we'll<br/>get the chance to fill you in at some point.")
('Van', "Anyway, I'm gonna hit up Dingo and Bermotti<br/>for starters.")
('Yumé', "Mmm... I'm too full to eat any more...")
('System', 'On the way to Oración, they came across several<br/>checkpoints put up due to the emergency declaration,<br/>but the CID had arranged for them to pass through.')
('System', 'After a brief pit stop in Anchorville, they hit the<br/>road northeast.')
('Aaron', '... ♪')
('Bergard', 'The city we are headed to was the capital of Calvard<br/>before the revolution one hundred years ago.')
('Bergard', 'It has a population of around 280,000 people, making<br/>it the third most populous city in the Republic.')
('Aaron', "That's a lot fewer people than the capital's 800,000<br/>and Langport's 550,000.")
('Aaron', "But man, oh, man, this bike you got here is pure fire!<br/>I can't wipe the grin off my face!")
('Bergard', "Heh. I'm glad you are enjoying it, but do ride<br/>with care.")
('Van', "Bah. Didn't get half that reaction when he was drivin'<br/>MY girl...")
('Quatre', 'I guess even obsessing over something has its<br/>downs, huh?')
('Judith', 'Heehee. I think your truck is nice and comfy, if<br/>it helps.')
('Bergard', '...Now, we know that many other groups are also<br/>making their way to our destination.')
('Bergard', 'I am aware of Heiyue and several jaeger corps...')
('Bergard', "...as well as the Gralsritter, and the Papal Guard's<br/>secret unit.")
('Quatre', 'You were in the Gralsritter if I recall, right?')
('Van', "Yeah. It's an elite force affiliated with the<br/>Congregation for the Sacraments that primarily exists<br/>to recover artifacts.")
('Agnès', "And then we have the Papal Guard, the Holy City of<br/>Arteria's peacekeeping force.")
('Agnès', 'So they have a special unit of sorts, too?')
('Van', "I'm no expert on them, myself. Can you tell us a bit<br/>about them?")
('Bergard', 'Certainly. As you may be aware, the Gralsritter is a<br/>relatively small organization comprised of around a<br/>thousand people.')
('Bergard', 'The Papal Guard is a force 30,000 strong that answers<br/>directly to the Congregation for Divine Worship.<br/>It took part in the war against the Empire.')
('Bergard', 'The relationship between the two congregations was<br/>strained even before that, but it became more so after<br/>the war.')
('Bergard', 'Still, while the Papal Guard may have the upper hand<br/>in numbers, the Gralsritter has significant advantages<br/>that the guard does not.')
('Bergard', 'Chief among them are the Dominions—the twelve<br/>knights that lead the organization, one of whom I<br/>used to be.')
('Bergard', 'Their power, and the power of the unique abilities<br/>they wield, is overwhelming.')
('Bergard', 'You encountered the fourth and eleventh among<br/>them in the Blacklight District some time ago.')
('Bergard', 'Their strength, too, is incredible—incredible enough<br/>to match that pair from the society we met yesterday.')
('Aaron', 'For real? Damn.')
('Agnès', 'That red-haired woman seemed so adorable to me...')
('Feri', "That weapon she had wasn't so adorable, though.")
('Van', "Gotta have some bite to stand up against<br/>the Direwolf. Most people'd be scared outta<br/>their mind.")
('Van', 'So, wait. Then the other hooded guy who was down<br/>there that day...')
('Bergard', "He is Iscariot's second-in-command—Iscariot being<br/>the Papal Guard's secret unit I mentioned earlier.")
('Bergard', 'His name is Ashladd. He does not have any<br/>extraordinary abilities like a Dominion, but he is still<br/>a veteran in combat.')
('Bergard', 'He learned how to wield a battle mace from me<br/>personally, so in a sense, he is another student<br/>of mine.')
('Van', '...Huh.')
('Judith', "With the Papal Guard being so big, I'm sure even<br/>their secret unit's pretty sizable, huh?")
('Judith', 'And the Oathbreaker is probably right that everyone<br/>taking part in this has their own schemes in mind,<br/>them included.')
('Bergard', 'Likely so. If I were to speculate, I would say that the<br/>Gralsritter aims to take Almata into custody and<br/>recover their artifacts.')
('Bergard', 'As for Iscariot, I believe they seek to destroy the<br/>artifacts or intercept their recovery...')
('Bergard', "...as well as execute all of Almata's members, who<br/>have no doubt long been branded as heretics.")
('Agnès', "'Execute'...?")
('Aaron', "So their job's to take out traitors and criminals?<br/>Sounds kinda like Heiyue's xiongshou.")
('Aaron', "I didn't think there were people like that in<br/>the church.")
('Quatre', "The church's situation sounds complicated enough—<br/>and they're just a small portion of the groups we'll<br/>be facing.")
('Quatre', 'Once we arrive, our first goal should be assessing the<br/>situation on the ground, I suppose.')
('Risette', 'I expect to hear what headquarters plans to do soon<br/>as well.')
('Feri', "I'll know for sure if there are any jaegers or warriors in<br/>the city once we get there.")
('Feri', "Judging by how many people are going to be<br/>gathering there, I wouldn't be surprised if Abi and the<br/>rest of our people come.")
('Van', "We'll have to see what we can learn from the guild<br/>and the CID, too.")
('Van', "As soon as we've finished contacting everyone and<br/>learning all we can, we'll get right to work.")
('Agnès', 'All right!')
('Aaron', "Sounds like we're about to get real busy!")
('Bergard', 'Haha. You look more comfortable riding an<br/>orbal bike than I was expecting.')
('Bergard', 'I heard your undying love was to cars, so this comes<br/>as something of a surprise.')
('Van', "I've borrowed one from a friend a few times since<br/>they hit the market a couple years ago, but that's<br/>about all the ridin' experience I got.")
('Van', "Nothin' beats my Ingert, but I'll give you that it's nice<br/>to feel the wind in your hair when you're out on<br/>the road.")
('Bergard', 'Heh. That it is—a fine benefit that only two wheels<br/>can offer.')
('Bergard', 'Another being that attractive women often strike up<br/>conversations with me in pit stops and suchlike.')
('Van', "Well, look who's popular. You really are livin' it up<br/>now, huh?")
('Van', "I sure hope I'm like you or President Rocksmith when<br/>I'm your age.")
('Bergard', 'It is a luxury that only the aged get to enjoy when<br/>they are freed from the shackles of obligation that<br/>have held them all their lives.')
('Bergard', 'Still, there is plenty that only the young can enjoy in<br/>life—so I suggest you and your friends do just that.')
('Van', "Heh. I dunno if I'm really that young anymore, but I<br/>get you.")
('Van', 'So...')
('Van', "I take it they're the real reason you planned to go off<br/>on your own?")
('Van', "They're trying to keep their distance, but there's three<br/>cars behind us and two ahead.")
('Bergard', 'Well, I thought it a shame to spoil an otherwise<br/>pleasant evening.')
('Bergard', 'I intend to lead them out to the outskirts of the city.')
('Van', 'Those guns are Zecht Arms models, huh?')
('Van', 'So, you from the company?')
('Van', "We didn't have to fight you in the underground—<br/>even if we've dealt with you in the past.")
('Van', "We didn't have to fight you in the underground, but<br/>we knew you were there.")
('Bergard', "I'm well aware that you have been following me<br/>around these past few days.")
('Bergard', 'I would assume that is because you have somehow<br/>learned my former name.')
(40302, "That's right, Roaring Lion.")
(40303, 'We thought you were finally dead, but here you are<br/>skulking around under some pseudonym!')
(40304, "We're here to pay you back for what you did to<br/>our company!")
('Van', '...Just what did you do?')
('Bergard', 'Four years ago, they were testing a new weapon in an<br/>area I was operating in.')
('Bergard', 'During the tests, local civilians were placed in danger.<br/>I then stopped it by destroying the weapon and taking<br/>care of their members.')
('Van', 'Pretty cut and dry, then.')
('Van', "Sounds to me like you got what you deserved.<br/>Not the best justification to be followin'<br/>someone around.")
(40314, "If he hadn't interfered in our test, our company would<br/>be seeing even greater success than it already has!")
(40311, "So now that he's lost that power of his, it's time he<br/>answered for his actions!")
(40302, "And if you're going to get in our way, spriggan, we'll<br/>take you down right with him!")
('Van', 'You are WAY underestimating my master here.<br/>If you honestly think you can take him down—')
('Bergard', 'No. I think this may be the perfect chance to show<br/>me what you currently know. Do not use your<br/>stun caliber.')
('Bergard', 'Show me the fruits of your Kunlun school<br/>teachings instead.')
('Van', "Heh. All right. If that's what you want.")
('Van', "It's been a while since I last had to fight hand to<br/>hand, but here we go!")
('Bergard', "Very good! Then let's begin!")
('Bergard', 'Haaaaaah...')
(40303, 'Ugh!')
(40304, 'Wh-What the hell?!')
('Van', 'Oooh...! / Haaaaaah!')
(40303, 'Ugh... How is he still so strong even without his<br/>old abilities?')
(40304, "You'll regret this, spriggan!")
('Van', '*pant* Whew. Sure put me through my paces.')
('Van', "Please don't make me fight people packin' advanced<br/>weaponry with my bare fists again, Master...")
('Bergard', 'Haha! Yet you triumphed, did you not?')
('Bergard', 'Your current combat style may be a mix of the<br/>Kunlun school and hollow style...')
('Bergard', '...but I see that you did indeed fight using only the<br/>techniques that I taught you.')
('Van', "Of course. If I didn't, this would've all been<br/>for nothing.")
('Van', 'You took advantage of you being targeted to make<br/>me remember my Kunlun roots.')
('Van', "You could've handled those guys on your own just<br/>fine, but you chose to invite me along just for that.")
('Van', "Man...you really haven't changed at all.")
('Bergard', 'Haha...')
('Bergard', 'Still, I do hope it went some way to reminding you of<br/>how you used to be.')
('Bergard', 'You looked to the future when you were training<br/>under me. More than you do now, at least.')
('Van', '...!')
('Van', "Well...I'll admit, it did take me back.")
('Van', 'You taught me to be calm and one in spirit with the<br/>land and the Kunlun Mountains—to find a way<br/>forward using the energies coursing through us.')
('Van', "Those teachings are more relevant than ever now that<br/>I'm working with so many others who aren't so sure<br/>where they belong.")
('Bergard', "Indeed—and I hope you'll always keep that in<br/>your heart.")
('Bergard', 'Remember what you have created throughout the life<br/>you have chosen, and what is truly capable of<br/>binding you.')
('Bergard', "Only you can face your demons, but I'll do all I can to<br/>aid you.")
('Bergard', 'For you will always be my student, and I will always<br/>be proud of you.')
('Van', '...')
('Van', "...I'll do my best to keep that in mind.")
('Van', 'Thank you very much, Master Barkhorn.')
('Bergard', 'Heh. Then let us return to the city.')
('Bergard', 'I ought to be able to enjoy the journey back with my<br/>student much more now that the matter has been<br/>dealt with.')
('Dominion Celis', "That's our master, all right. So he's just as good to his<br/>unofficial student, too, then?")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "I'm not at all surprised. That's simply his way—once<br/>he makes up his mind to guide someone, he will never<br/>turn his back on them.")
('Dominion Celis', "Well, he did a decent enough job in Oración, so let's<br/>hope we can count on him at least a little in<br/>the future.")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'Only time will tell if that is truly the case.')
('System', 'Together, Van and Bergard made their way back to<br/>the capital, enjoying the cool, peaceful night breeze as<br/>they did so.')
('System', 'They then resumed their respective tasks upon<br/>returning to Edith.')
('Professor Cronkite', "You're right on time.")
('Hermès', 'I just came out onto the highway.')
('Hermès', 'Thanks to your help, I was able to get through the<br/>checkpoint without issue.')
('Hermès', "There's a lot less traffic on the roads than usual, so I<br/>expect I'll reach you a little ahead of schedule.")
('Professor Cronkite', 'Excellent. I will be waiting.')
('Professor Cronkite', "I wasn't sure if you would be able to oblige our<br/>request, so I am pleased you have been able to.")
('Hermès', "I'm well aware you're against the clock. Saying no was<br/>never an option.")
('Hermès', "Especially since I'm connected to this project, too.<br/>I'll make sure these parts are delivered—I swear it on<br/>my name as a courier.")
('Professor Cronkite', "I'm sure you will. I trust in your abilities.")
('Professor Cronkite', 'As long as the parts arrive safely, I have no specific<br/>instructions on how you deliver them.')
('Professor Cronkite', "I'm counting on you. Contact me again once<br/>you arrive.")
('Hermès', 'Understood, Professor Cronkite.')
