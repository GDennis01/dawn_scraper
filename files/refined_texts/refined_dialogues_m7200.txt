('System', 'Van and the others then proceeded through the<br/>hidden routes to the Blacklight District they had<br/>traveled through before.')
('System', 'Along the way, they approached a spare railway line<br/>that was rarely in use.')
('Feri', 'Just look at this...')
('Risette', "It's just like aboveground.")
('Fie', "More underlings. Doesn't look like they're here 'cause<br/>of the demon spheres, though.")
('Kincaid', 'More underlings. It would appear they have nothing<br/>to do with the demon spheres, however.')
('Cao', "I see we've found more underlings, though the demon<br/>spheres seem uninvolved.")
('Van', "Maybe, but that doesn't change the fact that there are<br/>some tough bastards roamin' around.")
('Van', 'Whether we pick them off or slip by, keep your wits<br/>about you.')
('Feri', 'G-Got it!')
('Aaron', 'All we gotta do is bust some ass if they plan on<br/>getting in our way.')
('Feri', "Oh! The pattern's gone!")
('Aaron', 'And those devils are nowhere to be found.')
('Van', "Yeah, I don't smell a thing. We should be safe<br/>going forward.")
('Risette', 'Understood.')
('Fie', "What's our next move, Van? Head straight for the<br/>Blacklight District?")
('Kincaid', 'In that case, shall we head straight for the<br/>Blacklight District?')
('Cao', 'Then shall we make way straight for the<br/>Blacklight District?')
('Van', "(I don't smell anything, so we should be good<br/>going forward.)")
('System', 'Proceeding beyond this point will remove guests from<br/>the party.')
