('Feri', 'This place sure is creepy.')
('Agnès', 'I never knew there was a railway under the city.')
('Quatre', "It probably hasn't seen any use in over a decade.")
('Risette', "That's correct, actually. Records indicate it was<br/>abandoned twelve years ago when the subway<br/>was expanded.")
('Risette', 'It has been left untouched ever since.')
('Judith', "And thanks to that, it's become a nesting ground<br/>for monsters.")
('Judith', "This is a good find. I'll be sure to make good use of<br/>this place when I'm doing my heists.")
('Agnès', "I'm still a little puzzled as to why we were sent down<br/>here—particularly at a time like this.")
('Aaron', "They're carrying on like it's business as usual.<br/>It pisses me off.")
('Van', "I think there's more to this case than it seems.")
('Feri', 'Oh!')
('Quatre', 'Dead monsters?!')
('Risette', 'Those are clean cuts. Whoever did this is clearly a<br/>master of their craft.')
('Judith', 'I wonder who it was.')
('Van', 'Could be a rival from another field, I guess.')
('Van', "Either way, the CID gave us a job, so let's get it done.")
('Risette', "(...I see what's going on.)")
('Quatre', "The monster's supposed to be a fair way inside, so<br/>let's pick up the pace.")
('Bracer Alvis', 'E-Elaine!')
('Elaine', "I'm going to need you to fall back, Alvis! I'll take care<br/>of these.")
('Bracer Alvis', "What? No! That's too much to handle—even for you!")
('Aaron', 'Damn.')
('Feri', "She's incredible.")
('Quatre', "I recognize her. She's one of the guild's A-rank<br/>bracers, right?")
('Van', '...Knew it.')
('Bracer Alvis', "Huh? What're you guys doing here?!")
('Agnès', "I'm glad you're all right, Alvis!")
('Van', "You can hang back for this one! We'll make sure she<br/>comes out of this unscathed!")
('Bracer Alvis', 'Ugh...')
('Van', 'Agnès, Judith, and I are gonna join up with Elaine.<br/>The rest of you can take on the other one!')
('Feri', 'Understood!')
('Risette', 'Leave it to us!')
('Agnès', "Sh-She's really going all out...")
('Judith', "I've heard rumors about Beauty's Blade's strength, but<br/>they don't do her justice.")
('Judith', 'You sure she needs backup?')
('Van', "Maybe not, but she's throwin' caution to the<br/>wind here.")
('Van', "And I don't like it. Not one bit.")
('Agnès', "Elaine! We're here to help!")
('Judith', "It's no use. She's completely absorbed in her fight.")
('Judith', "What's the plan? I don't think we can just jump into<br/>the fray.")
('Elaine', "You're hopeless, Van. It's a good thing I'm here to<br/>babysit you. You'd be a lost cause without me!")
('Elaine', "Shut up, Lainey! And whaddaya mean by 'babysit'?!<br/>I'm older than you!")
('Elaine', "*sigh* You two are such children. I suppose it's up to<br/>me to teach you how to behave.")
('Van', 'Get a grip, Lainey!')
('Elaine', '...?!')
('Elaine', 'Van? Why are you...?')
('Van', "Is this an off day or something? Your bladework's<br/>sloppy, and you're totally oblivious to<br/>your surroundings.")
('Van', 'Now look over there!')
('Elaine', '...!')
('Van', "My assistants have that one on lock, so we'll lend you<br/>a hand here!")
('Elaine', '...Fine, then!')
('Agnès', 'You have my support!')
('Judith', "We'll take it down in no time!")
('System', 'Found <br/>.')
('System', 'Found <br/>.')
('Aaron', 'Whew. We made short work of that one.')
('Feri', 'Are you guys all right?!')
('Elaine', '...')
('Van', '*sigh*...')
('Van', 'Listen, I know the incident in Creil came as a shock.<br/>It did for us all.')
('Van', "But you can't lose your cool like this. An A-rank<br/>bracer's gotta be calm and composed even when the<br/>going gets tough.")
('Bracer Alvis', "Who do you think you're...?")
('Van', "Take some deep breaths. Everything's gonna be fine.")
('Van', "There'll be trying times ahead, sure, but we'll get<br/>through 'em. Just gotta take things one step at a time.")
('Van', 'And that goes for everyone here—not just you<br/>and me.')
('Elaine', '...I know that.')
('Elaine', "I know that! I'm trying SO hard to stay calm!")
('Elaine', "But even still, we...no, I couldn't protect them!<br/>I'm supposed to be a beacon of strength for<br/>the people. And I failed them!")
('Elaine', "If only I didn't let that man escape back<br/>in Langport...")
('Elaine', "No, even before that. If I just hadn't...")
('Van', 'Elaine...')
('Van', "Sounds like you're bottlin' something up.")
('Van', "If you need someone to lend an ear, I'm here for y—")
('Elaine', 'Are you really?')
('Elaine', 'Then tell me, Van. Why did you leave me?')
('Van', '...')
('Van', 'I...')
('Elaine', "...I'm sorry. I don't know what came over me.")
('Elaine', 'We defeated both of our targets, and we may not<br/>have done so without your timely aid.')
('Elaine', 'I apologize for how I treated you back there, Alvis.<br/>You fought admirably.')
('Bracer Alvis', 'Elaine...')
('Elaine', "...I'm going to take my leave now. I still have other<br/>work to do.")
('Elaine', "I'll make certain you get compensated for your<br/>portion of the work.")
('Elaine', '...The loss of Dingo Brad was nothing short of<br/>a tragedy.')
('Elaine', 'There were times when he beat us to the punch, but<br/>his intelligence proved indispensable on a number<br/>of occasions.')
('Van', '...Same for me, too.')
('Elaine', 'If you can, try and keep an eye on that Tyrell<br/>Times reporter.')
('Elaine', "She's getting dangerously close to the criminal<br/>underworld, and she doesn't seem to be taking any of<br/>my warnings to heart.")
('Elaine', "Alvis, we're leaving.")
('Bracer Alvis', 'W-Wait!')
('Aaron', 'Hmph.')
('Quatre', "She's just as strong as everyone claims.")
('Feri', "But I'm a little worried about her now...")
('Agnès', '(What could have compelled her to be so reckless in<br/>that fight? Also...)')
('Judith', 'Well, I guess we know why that presidential aide sent<br/>us down here.')
('Judith', "So what's next? Should we go check up on<br/>that reporter?")
('Risette', 'That might be prudent. If she is closing in on the<br/>criminal underworld, then she can only be headed to<br/>one place.')
('Quatre', "The so-called 'Blacklight District,' correct?")
('Van', "Yeah. If she's there, we gotta drag her out. That place<br/>is crawlin' with criminals of all shapes and sizes.")
('Van', "Wonder how she found out about that place, though.<br/>Dingo never would've told her about it or shared its<br/>location with her.")
('Feri', "Well, there's more than one way to crack an egg.")
('Agnès', "Right. She could have found out from some of her<br/>other connections. I'm worried about her...")
('Aaron', "Then let's find her. Can't hurt to check and see if<br/>she's all right.")
('Van', 'Yeah, I agree.')
('Van', "We should head straight there. There's no time<br/>to waste.")
('System', 'Quest Last Stop―Destruction! completed!')
('System', 'Received')
('System', 'Head to the Blacklight District?')
('FIO', 'Commencing proximity probe.')
('FIO', 'Response found! Heat signature detected!')
('FIO', 'Response found! Heat signature detected!')
('Risette', 'There he is!')
('XEROS', 'GRR...')
('Agnès', "XEROS! Oh, I'm so glad we found you!")
('XEROS', 'RUFF!')
('Feri', 'What a relief.')
('Aaron', "Heh. You're looking well, buddy!")
('Van', "I get it now. So you picked up Quatre's scent, and<br/>that led you here.")
('Agnès', "But the scent ends here, and there's<br/>nothing underground. Did we get all that right?")
('XEROS', 'GRR... RUFF!')
('Judith', "Well, that's strange... What's going on?")
('Rixia', "I suspect there's a demon stone somewhere in<br/>the vicinity. That must be the origin of the scent.")
('Bergard', 'These stones appear to be similar in nature to the<br/>demon spheres. That must be why they could sense<br/>Quatre through it.')
('FIO', 'Correct. I can detect his unique spiritual wavelength.')
('FIO', 'Continued caution is advised.')
('Aaron', 'Ugh. These stones are probably gonna be just as<br/>much of a pain to take out as the spheres.')
('Risette', 'A distinct possibility.')
('Risette', 'Regardless, if we can determine where this one is<br/>lurking, we have ways of drawing it out of<br/>the shadows.')
('Feri', "Well, what are we waiting for? Let's smash that stone<br/>so we can get Quatre back!")
('XEROS', 'RUFF!')
('Feri', 'Hmm? What is it, XEROS?')
('Agnès', 'It looks like they have something to tell you.')
('FIO', 'XEROS is granting you temporary authorization to<br/>execute their offensive programs.')
('FIO', 'They want to be of service in rescuing Quatre.')
('Feri', 'W-Wait, you want me to give you commands in<br/>battle like Quatre does?')
('Van', "Sure sounds like it. You've handled military monsters<br/>before, so I'd say you're more than qualified.")
('Feri', "Umm... I mean, I've only done that in training...")
('Feri', "...but if you trust me, then I'll do my best. Let's save<br/>your master together!")
('XEROS', 'RUFF!')
('Agnès', "Heehee. I'm sure we don't have anything to worry<br/>about if Feri's in charge!")
('Aaron', "Maaan... Why couldn't it have given<br/>me authorization?")
('Judith', "Maybe if you weren't so unbelievably untrustworthy,<br/>you'd have a shot.")
('Van', "All right, gang. Let's smoke that stone out!")
('System', 'Feri can temporarily use <br/>.')
('Shaheena', 'A-An underground railroad?! Are we even allowed to<br/>be here?!')
('Van', "Maybe not, but it's not like anyone else uses<br/>it anymore!")
('Van', "I know of an exit near Trion Tower. Buckle up, 'cause<br/>I'm about to let her rip!")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'A-All right!')
('Van', "Whoa! There's another car down here, and there's a<br/>couple of hotties in the back!")
('Van', "Hell yeah! That thing's got some awesome parts on it.<br/>This is our lucky day!")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "Th-There's another car on our tail!")
('Van', "Must be some scumbags from the Blacklight District.<br/>Well, they ain't gonna catch ME!")
('Shaheena', 'Make them eat our dust!')
