('Judith', 'Wh... L-Let go of me!')
('Feri', 'It came from over there!')
('Van', 'That voice... It figures.')
(61390, 'Hnngh!')
(61391, 'Haaaah!')
('Judith', 'L-Let me GO, alre—wait! I know you!')
('Agnès', 'Miss Grimcat!')
('Aaron', 'Sorry. We interrupt your fun?')
('Feri', '(Wh-Why is my heart beating so fast all of<br/>a sudden?)')
('Judith', "Do I LOOK like I'm having fun?! Now hurry up and<br/>give me a hand!")
('Van', 'Guess we got no choice.')
('Van', 'You owe us one now—or two, if we count the night<br/>before last.')
('Judith', "Shut up! Just make with the punching and knock<br/>'em out!")
('Judith', "Oof... It's not easy, knocking people out without<br/>really hurting them.")
('Judith', 'What took you guys so long, anyway?!')
('Van', "You understand we didn't come to save you in the<br/>first place, right?")
('Aaron', "She IS one of the people we're here to help, though.<br/>Technically.")
('Feri', "Oh, you're right... We're glad you're safe!")
('Judith', "Well, uhh...I-I have NO idea what you're<br/>talking about!")
('Agnès', '(...Why does this seem familiar somehow?)')
('Risette', '(I see now...)')
('Van', 'Either way, you still owe us. So you can pay us back<br/>with a little friendly info swapping.')
('Judith', 'So the orbal hookahs were what made all of<br/>this possible...')
('Judith', "Those scumbags have sent everyone who's ever<br/>smoked one into a frenzy.")
('Van', 'Sounds like Almata had people in the hotel after all.')
('Van', "And sure enough, they brought the device we're<br/>looking for along with them.")
('Agnès', "Judging by the color, it's likely the one that angelic<br/>doll carried off.")
('Agnès', 'It must have been delivered to them after the fact.')
('Risette', 'That girl did say something about how she and that<br/>doll had already played their part.')
('Feri', "Hmm... We've met Melchior before, but who could<br/>the man in the coat be?")
('Judith', "That's a good freaking question. I've never seen him<br/>before, either.")
('Judith', 'The prince and Naje bought most of us time to<br/>escape by fighting against them, but I ended up<br/>getting separated from everyone.')
('Judith', 'I think Nina and Mr. Gotti are still there, though...')
('Agnès', 'Oh, dear! We sh—hmm? Wait. You sound awfully<br/>familiar with—')
('Judith', "All right. Now it's my turn to start making demands!")
('Judith', 'Access to the staircase is locked, and only<br/>this keycard can unlock it!')
('Judith', "So if you want to progress any farther, you'll have to<br/>lend me a hand!")
('Van', 'Secured that card in advance, huh?')
('Aaron', 'Really living up to your name as the burglar queen.')
('Judith', 'I am a PHANTOM THIEF, not a burglar! And my<br/>work is only just starting.')
('Judith', "They might think they've stolen this festival and its<br/>participants from us, but I'm going to steal them<br/>right back!")
('Judith', "But even I can't handle a job like this alone, so I'm<br/>gonna give you the honor of helping me!")
('Judith', 'You better not have any problems with that!')
('Feri', "No way! We'd really appreciate the help!")
('Risette', 'The odds are very much stacked against us.<br/>We welcome any aid you have to offer.')
('Van', "Even if it IS from Puss in Spandex. Beggars can't be<br/>choosers, I guess.")
('Judith', "Puss in WHAT?! Oh, whatever. It's a deal, then.")
('Judith', "Let's get moving. We need to make it to the top<br/>floor, where the awards were going to be presented!")
('Feri', 'Right!')
('Aaron', "*sigh* Man, she's got the looks. It's just a shame<br/>about...everything else.")
('Agnès', '(Umm... No, I suppose it can wait until all of this<br/>is over.)')
('System', "Judi—...Ahem. 'Grimcat the Phantom Thief'<br/>joined the party as a guest.")
('Van', '...!')
('Feri', 'L-Look!')
('Agnès', 'Wow...')
('Risette', "They're both deeply captivating.")
('Van', "Heh. Saara's holdin' her own pretty well.")
('Melchior', "Oh, absolutely. It's quite an achievement to be able to<br/>keep up with one enhanced to superhuman levels by<br/>that mask. ♪")
('Feri', "It's because she's Shaheena's sister!")
('Aaron', 'Cue the psycho.')
('Nina', 'Y-You came!')
('Director Gotti', 'Our saviors! Are we glad to see you!')
('Agnès', 'Nina! Mr. Gotti!')
('Judith', 'It looks like neither of them are hurt, thank Aidios.')
('Director Gotti', "G-Grimcat! What's that spicy cougar doing here?!")
('Judith', "I'm too young to be a COUGAR, thank you!")
('Nina', 'What ARE you doing here, though?')
('Judith', 'Ahhhhh... Umm, well, I was asked by an actress to<br/>come and...help, you see!')
('Melchior', "So you're the phantom thief people are<br/>talking about... Come to steal our 'treasure,' I take it?")
('Melchior', "I didn't realize you were working hand in hand—or<br/>rather, paw in hand—with the spriggan.")
('Aaron', "We're not friends or anything... Just united in<br/>wanting to smash your face in.")
('Feri', 'Not just for what you did to Aida, but for all the hurt<br/>you caused Shaheena and so many others in<br/>Tharbad, too!')
('Dantès', 'Could we perhaps tone the noise down?')
('Dantès', 'The show is almost at its climax.')
('Dantès', 'It would be a shame to miss it over a bout of<br/>petty sniping.')
('Van', '...')
('Melchior', 'Haha. Sorry about that, boss. ❤')
('Agnès', '...!')
('Aaron', 'Wait... Are you telling me...?')
('Feri', 'N-No way...')
('Dantès', 'My name is Gerard Dantès, the head of Almata.')
('Dantès', "So you are the spriggan. Somehow this doesn't quite<br/>feel like our first encounter.")
('Dantès', 'Would you care to join us in watching the show?<br/>It seems, perhaps, that this was fated to be.')
('Van', "Heh. We plan to see this to the end...but hell if we're<br/>gonna do it with you.")
('Van', "That'd just rain all over the hard work these kids've<br/>put in.")
('Dantès', 'Hmm... A pity.')
('Risette', "Almata's leader. An SS-level threat.")
('Risette', "Fate notwithstanding, you are correct. This isn't even<br/>our first time meeting in this city.")
('Aaron', '...What?')
('Agnès', "*gasp* You don't mean...")
('Feri', 'He was that guy in the casino?!')
('Van', "There I was, thinkin' Almata had no presence here in<br/>this city...")
('Van', "...when their leader was hidin' in plain sight the<br/>whole damn time.")
('Dantès', "It's simply a matter of efficiency. I believe in taking a<br/>hands-on approach to my work.")
('Dantès', 'Whether it is disposing of pawns and abandoning<br/>positions, or giving tools and products a<br/>firsthand trial.')
('Aaron', 'You son of a bitch...')
('Van', 'Now I get it.')
('Van', "There's a lot goin' on here, but your main goal here<br/>was some kinda experiment.")
('Van', 'To see just what you could pull off by combining<br/>those drugs with that device.')
('Feri', 'Wha...?')
('Agnès', 'That does fit with what they were trying to do in<br/>Creil and Langport, too.')
('Agnès', "So this chaos right now isn't a means to an end, it's<br/>an end in itself?")
('Dantès', 'Correct.')
('Dantès', 'Whether it was securing new distribution routes, or<br/>testing our ability to use this heirloom to instigate an<br/>uprising of sorts...')
('Dantès', "...the data we've obtained from this promises to be<br/>quite valuable in what is to come.")
('Dantès', 'The mask cannot be reused, alas—but I believe this to<br/>be a satisfactory application.')
('Dantès', 'Good work, Melchior.')
('Melchior', 'Thanks, boss. ❤')
('Melchior', "That pretty thing latches on to the darkness and<br/>vulnerability in people's hearts, making puppets out<br/>of them.")
('Melchior', "I'm glad I was able to steal a spare during the chaos in<br/>Crossbell a year and a half ago. ♪")
('Feri', "They're...total monsters...")
('Risette', 'Yes. We may need to increase their threat level<br/>to SS+.')
('Judith', '(Huh... That was one of the many crises<br/>SHE was involved in...)')
('Agnès', 'We will not allow this madness to go on<br/>a moment longer!')
('Agnès', "We're taking that Genesis back from you, whatever<br/>it takes!")
('Dantès', 'Oh! Well, you can have it.')
('Dantès', 'These devices were designed to eventually come into<br/>the hands of their rightful owners regardless. That is<br/>their nature.')
('Agnès', 'What...?')
('Van', 'Sounds like you have a lot of info you could share<br/>with us.')
('Dantès', 'Perhaps. Yet only a fraction of all there is to know.')
('Dantès', 'Now that we have seen the fruits of our labor, our<br/>work here is done.')
('Dantès', 'Withdrawing would be a valid option. However...')
('Judith', 'Wha...?')
('Nina', 'Prince Sherid...?')
('Director Gotti', 'And Naje, too... I thought the two of you<br/>had escaped?')
('Naje', '...')
('Prince Sherid', "...I'm sorry, everyone.")
('Van', "Don't tell me...")
('Agnès', "You've had some of that drug, too?!")
('Melchior', 'Ahaha! Yep! All it took was a few little droplets in<br/>their welcome drink. ❤')
('Dantès', 'Here is the final amusement of the festival.')
('Dantès', 'I do hope you can keep me at least as entertained as<br/>those dancers did.')
('Prince Sherid', 'Ngh... Aaaaaargh!')
('Naje', 'Nnrrgh...!')
('Melchior', 'Catgirls and gentlemen!')
('Melchior', 'In one corner, we have none other than a crown<br/>prince of the desert and his ever-so loyal servant!')
('Melchior', 'And in the other, we have the simple spriggan<br/>of Edith. Just who between them will<br/>emerge victorious?')
('Feri', 'Those golden auras are bad news...')
('Aaron', "We're really in it now!")
('Risette', "This tension... It's incomparable to that of our fight<br/>in the cave!")
('Nina', 'Take care!')
('Director Gotti', 'Wh-What are you gonna do?!')
('Van', "We're gonna neutralize 'em—we ain't got<br/>any other options!")
('Judith', "They're sponsors to the festival! We need to make<br/>them see sense!")
('Agnès', 'Right! Saara and Shaheena are depending on us, too!')
('Naje', '...Well fought.')
('Prince Sherid', 'Haha. That it was.')
('Feri', "They're back to normal!")
('Agnès', 'W-We did it!')
('Dantès', "On the contrary. We've hardly started.")
('Dantès', 'This device can do far, far more.')
('Dantès', 'For it is capable of stimulating the emotion that lies<br/>at the root of all others: fear.')
('Dantès', "Now, why don't you show me yours?")
('Naje', 'Ugh... AAAAAAAAAAAAGH!')
('Prince Sherid', 'Naje!')
('Prince Sherid', 'Urgh... My... My mana is—?!')
('Van', "You gotta be shittin' me...")
('Aaron', "It's like what I went through!")
('Naje', 'AAAAAAAAARGH!')
('Judith', 'What in the...?!')
('Agnès', 'I-It really is what happened to Aida and Aaron...')
('Feri', 'The legendary Verethragna...')
('Melchior', 'Ahaha! A being from a higher plane? Looks like you<br/>managed to reel in a big one, boss!')

('Dantès', 'Hmm... Rather shrewd of you.')

('Agnès', 'Right!')
('Feri', 'Got it!')
('Judith', "Hah! Don't say I didn't warn you!")
('Feri', 'That was amazing...')

('Agnès', 'A-Ahaha...')
('Risette', 'Everyone—if I may redirect your attention.')
('Van', "It's a keycard.")
('Feri', 'Could that be what we were looking for?!')
('Agnès', "Yes. I imagine it's the one needed to go to the<br/>top floor.")
