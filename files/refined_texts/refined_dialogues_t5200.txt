('Sr. Officer Irons', "For the last three days, we've been ordered to ignore<br/>all the jaegers that are strolling about town.")
('Sr. Officer Irons', "A lot of my fellow officers are a little on edge, and I<br/>don't blame them one bit.")
('Sr. Officer Irons', "But orders are orders—and I hear they come from<br/>the CID. Best to just do as we're told.")
('Sr. Officer Irons', 'Some people from one of the anti-immigrant factions<br/>have been stirring up trouble again. When will they<br/>ever learn their lesson?')
('Sr. Officer Irons', 'Why must they do a demonstration now of all<br/>times...?')
('Sr. Officer Irons', "If I could get a warrant, I'd happily put those bastards<br/>in cuffs, but unfortunately, they're being protected by<br/>some friends in high places...")
('Sr. Officer Irons', 'One of our very own bracers died fighting that<br/>mafia group...')
('Sr. Officer Irons', "Actually, I don't think the term 'mafia group' fits<br/>them anymore. They're terrorists, plain and simple.")
('Sr. Officer Irons', 'They must be stopped at all costs...')
('Sr. Officer Irons', "...and I believe the CID's Special Ops division can<br/>take them out once and for all!")
('Sr. Officer Irons', 'Those terrorists are still at large, so we have to do our<br/>utmost to protect the citizenry.')
('Sr. Officer Irons', 'We also have many tourists coming into our city<br/>every day.')
('Sr. Officer Irons', "I promise that we won't let you people down.")
('Baron Baudoin', "Over the past few days, I've noticed a fair number of<br/>bracers and shady-looking individuals out and about.")
('Baron Baudoin', 'Also, the air feels a tad thicker with the police on<br/>high alert. They are harming the calming ambience of<br/>the city.')
('Baron Baudoin', "Our not-so-competent 'boys in blue' are nothing like<br/>the royal guards of old.")
('Baron Baudoin', 'I cannot say I am too pleased with our current state<br/>of affairs. People have grown too accustomed to a<br/>society where nobles are not in power.')
('Baron Baudoin', 'Perhaps we really should consider allying with the<br/>more conservative nobles in the Empire...')
('Baron Baudoin', 'If noble power were to be restored internationally,<br/>then we may be able to bring Calvard back to its<br/>former glory.')
('Baron Baudoin', 'But whether we can make that a reality largely falls<br/>to them...')
('Baron Baudoin', 'Fortunately for us, Mayor Audran is sympathetic to<br/>our cause.')
('Baron Baudoin', 'I have met him at many social events and the like,<br/>and I can attest to his respect for the old ways of<br/>the nobility.')
('Baron Baudoin', 'We have to ensure he stays in office.')
('Baron Baudoin', "Jacobin's group always gets things done. We must get<br/>our message out to the ignorant masses.")
('Baron Baudoin', "...Hmm? Why are you giving me those looks? Do you<br/>perhaps think that I'm up to something suspicious?")
('Baron Baudoin', "Then allow me to set the record straight: I'm just<br/>doing my duty as a descendant of the old<br/>Calvard nobility.")
('Baron Baudoin', 'And that duty is the eradication of the filth that seeks<br/>to destroy the customs of old.')
('Baron Baudoin', 'Mark my words. We WILL cleanse our city of those<br/>vile immigrants. Equality of all races be damned!')
('Agnès', "(I...can't believe what I'm hearing. He's not even<br/>trying to hide his contempt.)")

('Manuel', 'I was planning to frame him for theft so I could<br/>impress Charlene with my sharp wit and intellect!<br/>Where did I go wrong?!')
('Manuel', "Hmph. Who would have thought my fiancée would<br/>be so demanding? Father made an interesting choice,<br/>that's for sure...")
('Manuel', "But no matter. I will do whatever I must to make my<br/>future bride's dreams come true!")
('Manuel', "How'd you enjoy your meal? One of Father's regular<br/>clients invested in that restaurant, you know.")
('Charlene', "It was acceptable, I suppose, but I'd much rather<br/>receive a gift in the form of a princess' dress and tiara<br/>rather than cuisine.")
('Charlene', "It's every girl's dream to travel the world while being<br/>dressed like the princesses of the old kingdom.")
('Manuel', "O-Oh, well... I'm sure we can make that happen!<br/>I'll ask Father right away!")
('Manuel', "I'll make your dreams come true! Promise!")
('Charlene', "Don't make promises you don't know you can keep.<br/>I think I'll keep my expectations in check.")
('Charlene', 'I am so disappointed in you, Manuel. So<br/>very disappointed.')
('Charlene', 'You had no right to treat him like that. Your behavior<br/>was unbecoming of someone of your standing.')
('Charlene', 'I shall have my father call off our marriage.')
('Manuel', 'Wh-What...? But why?! That disgusting little vermin<br/>got near you, so I had to—')
('Charlene', 'He only asked if you wanted your shoes shined.<br/>All you had to do was politely decline his offer.')
('Charlene', 'But you bullied him instead. If you were trying to<br/>impress me by acting tough, you failed miserably.')
('Manuel', 'N-No, I... Th-This is all a misunderstanding!')
('Charlene', "Well, well. This little event sounds most intriguing.<br/>And it's made possible by foreign royalty, no less.")
('Charlene', 'Now I truly will feel like a traveling princess.<br/>How could I refuse?')
('Manuel', "S-Surely you'll need someone to accompany you, yes?<br/>I'll be more than happy to—")
('Charlene', "While it's true that I'll have to mingle with children<br/>of lower classes, I can also meet people from other<br/>distinguished families as well.")
('Charlene', "It'll be nice to go out and enjoy this. By myself.")
('Manuel', 'Nooooooooo!')
('Charlene', 'Now that I think about it, Father did say he wanted<br/>to develop connections with the people of<br/>House Mourtier.')
('Charlene', "I wonder if their eldest son will be attending. I think<br/>I'll greet him if he's present.")
('Charlene', "Manuel showed his true colors. He's not a gentleman<br/>at all, much less the prince of my dreams.")
('Charlene', 'I think it would be best if Father called off<br/>our marriage.')
('Charlene', "It's every girl's dream to be a princess. They're prim,<br/>proper, elegant, beautiful, and intelligent.")
('Charlene', 'But most importantly, they always have a dashing<br/>prince by their side. Can Manuel really be the prince<br/>of my dreams?')
('Horton', "Yeah, there's no way they're only facing a 'little bit<br/>of trouble.' One look at Dupont can tell me<br/>that much.")
('Horton', "I'm sure doing business in this city isn't easy, but I<br/>wonder if there's something deeper going on...")
('Horton', 'I can never quite level with the wealthy clientele here.<br/>Their priorities and sensibilities are just so different<br/>from mine.')
('Horton', "I'm worried their pride will eventually lead to a<br/>collapse not unlike the one the old kingdom saw.")
('Horton', "You know the old saying, 'pride comes before a fall'?<br/>Well, I don't think the upper-class people here do.")
('Horton', '*sigh* As always, Oración is at the mercy of the<br/>whims of the upper class.')
('Horton', 'While the capital has adopted a number of<br/>technological advancements, this place is stuck in the<br/>past, and the people seem content with that.')
('Horton', 'And of course, the people at the bottom of the social<br/>ladder are the ones who suffer the most as a result...')
('Horton', 'I hate taking business trips to this place... I just want<br/>to be back home already.')
('Horton', "Okay, so here's the list of investments for Oración<br/>businesses from people in the capital, and here's the<br/>brokerage firm analysis data.")
('Banker Dupont', "Oh, dear. This is not good. I don't think those among<br/>the social elites are aware of how bad things are.")
('Banker Dupont', "If we can't make up for that deficit...")
('Horton', 'Wait. What deficit?')
('Horton', "I haven't heard anything about this.")
('Banker Dupont', "Ah, there's nothing to be worried about. The Oración<br/>Trust Bank is just facing a little bit of trouble.")
('Banker Dupont', "But we'll rebound in time, I'm sure.")
('Secretary Inno', "President Daltie is a very busy man, you see, so he<br/>doesn't have a complete grasp on what Lucio has<br/>been up to.")
('Secretary Inno', "But perhaps it's time to let him know.")
('Secretary Inno', 'If a lack of familial communication is what resulted in<br/>this incident, then the only remedy is for them to talk<br/>things out.')
('Secretary Inno', "I don't think I can entrust this task to the police or<br/>the guild.")
('Secretary Inno', 'I have no choice but to reach out to those fixers.<br/>I must ensure his safety at any cost.')
('Judith', '(Huh? Did he say something about fixers?)')
('Lucio', "Even after everything that's happened, he's<br/>prioritizing his meeting with the president of the<br/>Quincy Company over checking up on me.")
('Lucio', "Fine. I'd rather spend my time with the High Bloods<br/>over him anyway!")
('Lucio', 'Well, that was...distressing.')
('Lucio', 'Who in the hell were those people? And what are<br/>they plotting...?')
('Lucio', "No, I must purge this matter from my mind!<br/>I'm better off pretending this never happened!")
('Lucio', "We won't let these fools run wild on our turf.")
('Lucio', "It shouldn't be hard to crush them, should it come<br/>to that.")
('Lucio', "Perhaps this is a good opportunity to show people<br/>that we mean business—and that we're far superior to<br/>the old High Bloods gang.")
('Lucio', 'What? There are fools making a mess of the<br/>underground areas?')
('Damian', "Yeah, I saw them myself! We can't let them screw<br/>around on OUR home turf!")
('Lucio', "Hmph. If it is as you say, then I'm in<br/>complete agreement.")
('Lucio', "I say we send them back to wherever they came from.<br/>We'll show them the might of the High Bloods!")
('Lucio', "We'll do as the nobles of old did with intruders—<br/>subjugate and dispose.")
('Van', '(Ah, shit. Not these guys again.)')
('Van', "(Guess I should've realized we might run into<br/>them here. This is their home turf, after all.)")
('Van', "(Doesn't sound like they've learned their lesson.<br/>They're up to something for sure.)")
('Van', '(I guess I oughta keep an eye on them.)')
('Van', "(I've heard of the High Bloods. They're a street<br/>racing gang composed of kids of ETWS execs.)")
('Van', '(Supposedly they broke up after a trip to Crossbell,<br/>but I heard rumors about a new generation emerging.<br/>Guess they were true.)')
('Lucio', 'Last night was awful... Just who the hell were those<br/>people, anyway?')
('Tebo', 'Well, whoever they were, we need to stay faaar away<br/>from them.')
('Lucio', "Yeah... I don't like being toyed with, but we're better<br/>off letting this one go...")
('Van', '(Sounds like something happened to them last night.)')
('Van', '(Did they go into one of the underground entrances<br/>and run into someone? Scary. Thank the Goddess no<br/>rule violations happened.)')
('Secretary Inno', 'What you did was incredibly reckless.')
('Secretary Inno', 'Had the fixers not come to your rescue, who knows<br/>what would have happened to you.')
('Lucio', "Urgh... I'll admit that I went too far this time.")
('Lucio', "However, that doesn't change the fact that my<br/>grandfather doesn't give a damn about me!")
('Lucio', 'Am I wrong? Hmm?!')
('Secretary Inno', "I don't think his...inattention is due to lack of care.<br/>His work really does keep him busy.")
('Secretary Inno', 'Though I do understand how you feel. I can let him<br/>know that your feelings were hurt.')
('Damian', "They've got a lot of guts messing around on our<br/>home turf!")
('Damian', "Guess it's up to us to teach 'em a lesson!")
('Tebo', 'Is this our punishment for getting in over our<br/>heads...?')
('Tebo', "What's going on beneath our city...? Damn it! If this<br/>is a dream, someone wake me up already!")
('Adelina', 'Many people seemed a bit flustered last night at the<br/>social club.')
('Adelina', 'They were speaking as though we should be fearful of<br/>these recent terrorist attacks.')
('Adelina', 'I can understand their concern to some extent, but<br/>I believe they are overreacting.')
('Adelina', "Now, then. It's about time I headed to tonight's<br/>social club. I cannot afford to be late.")
('Adelina', "We do not hold these events just to pass the time, but<br/>I'm sure that's a difficult concept to grasp for<br/>lower-class people such as yourselves.")
('Adelina', 'President Daltie of ETWS and President Auclair of<br/>the Quincy Company often go to them, but neither<br/>will be present tonight, I hear.')
('Adelina', "Still, it's imperative for those in high society to attend<br/>so they can forge new relationships with other<br/>distinguished families.")
('Adelina', 'Both Mr. Auclair and Mr. Daltie were well known<br/>even before the end of the nobility, and they are still<br/>mainstays of high society.')
('Adelina', 'Oración prospered after the revolution in large part<br/>because prominent families banded together and were<br/>united as one.')
('Adelina', "That's why attending these social gatherings<br/>is imperative. If you think we are merely 'partying the<br/>night away,' then you are sorely mistaken.")
('Adelina', 'I heard an entire village was annihilated. How is that<br/>even possible?')
('Adelina', 'Well, I believe this shall serve as a grim reminder that<br/>we must never let the lower class hold power.')
('Adelina', 'After all, the mafia is made up of lowborn fools, no?')
('Adelina', 'This is undeniable proof that when those of lower<br/>standing achieve power and wealth, they will resort to<br/>barbaric behavior.')
('Olivia', "Perhaps it's because I've spent so much time in the<br/>capital, but I'm beginning to find people's attitudes<br/>here to be...off-putting.")
('Olivia', 'I went to the high society gathering last night, and it<br/>felt like the people there had no sympathy for the<br/>victims of the attack.')
('Olivia', 'I may have been raised here, but I still feel like I can<br/>objectively take a step back and see things for what<br/>they are.')
('Olivia', 'There is no high or low standing when it comes to<br/>praying for those who have lost their lives. I want to<br/>pray with everyone for a while.')
('Olivia', "Then I'll have to get ready for that social club tonight.<br/>I still can't believe they're holding those events at a<br/>time like this.")
('Olivia', "I have to attend it in my husband's place even though<br/>it feels as if the world is on fire...")
('Olivia', "I just can't believe it... Well, I suppose I'm not going<br/>to the capital now...")
('Butler Markley', "Yes. The state of emergency is still in effect in Edith,<br/>I'm afraid, so I don't think you'll be able to spend<br/>your vacation there.")
('Butler Markley', "Perhaps you can spend it here in Oración instead.<br/>I know it's not what you had planned, but there's<br/>plenty of things to do around the city.")
('Butler Markley', "I'm sure your husband would feel better about that<br/>anyway, given the current state of affairs.")
('Olivia', "What on earth are you talking about?! Do you really<br/>think I'm feeling sad simply because I cannot go to<br/>the capital?")
('Olivia', 'How can I be worried about my vacation plans when<br/>so many people were just taken from us?!')
('Butler Markley', "M-My apologies... I should've realized you weren't<br/>concerned about that.")
('Olivia', 'As long as you understand.')
('Olivia', 'Now, then. Shall we go in and pray?')
('Olivia', "I think I'll be able to return to my day-to-day life with<br/>peace of mind once I know the departed are resting<br/>by the Goddess' side.")
('Butler Markley', 'Please do not disparage your hometown so, Madam...')
('Butler Markley', 'Your husband is still very proud of this city.')
('Butler Markley', 'And he trusts you so much that he has you acting in<br/>his place.')
('Butler Markley', 'Her husband would not normally approve of her<br/>mingling with the lower class...')
('Butler Markley', "But I believe an exception can be made in this case.<br/>There's no harm in praying with everyone.")
('Butler Markley', 'However, she must attend the rest of the events<br/>as planned. She may not want to, but she has to.')
('Pino', 'C-Can I really join? Jean did come and invite me, so I<br/>guess I can...')
('Pino', 'Th-This is really happening, right? Pinch me. I must<br/>be dreaming.')
('Pino', "I got bullied again just a second ago. I've gotten kinda<br/>used to it, though, so it doesn't bother me a ton.")
('Pino', "A lot of rich kids around here hate my guts, but I can<br/>get by since I've got one really good friend. And that's<br/>Jean over at the orphanage.")
('Pino', 'Well, I guess I better pick myself back up and get<br/>back to work.')
('Pino', 'A-Are you guys travelers? Do you want your<br/>shoes shined?')
('Pino', "I'll do it for 50 mira each. How about it?")
('Pino', "I'm trying to earn some money so I can help<br/>my mom. She's really sick...")
('Agnès', '(Poor kid...)')
('Van', '(Yup. The wealth disparity in this city is<br/>pretty brutal.)')
('Van', "(This kinda thing ain't uncommon in Oración.)")
('Pino', 'How about I show you around the city?')
('Pino', "You don't even have to tip me if you don't want to.<br/>I'm just happy helping people.")
('Pino', "Though I'd be grateful if you did. My sister's income<br/>isn't enough to cover Mom's medical expenses, so I'm<br/>trying to earn a little money myself.")
('Priest Enel', "What are the people from Arteria doing here...?<br/>Something is off, but I can't quite place my finger<br/>on what...")
('Priest Enel', 'Oh, erm... Hello. We will be holding memorial mass<br/>again today. Let us all pray for those who have<br/>passed on.')
('Priest Enel', 'The people who were dispatched from Arteria are<br/>doing an investigation here.')
('Priest Enel', "Oh, but don't be alarmed. I doubt anything serious is<br/>going on.")
('Priest Enel', "Many people were in attendance for this afternoon's<br/>memorial mass. We all have a desire to mourn the<br/>lives that were lost.")
('Priest Enel', "I know the people in the capital want to do the same,<br/>but their grand cathedral hasn't held their services yet.<br/>They're moving quite slowly.")
('Priest Enel', "As I understand it, the delay is being caused by<br/>political motives. It's not right.")
('Priest Enel', 'Churches should not be held back by needless red<br/>tape, especially in times like this—where people just<br/>want to mourn the dead.')
('Priest Enel', "We're housing a few people that were dispatched<br/>from the Holy City of Arteria.")
('Priest Enel', "However, I haven't seen them much. They mainly<br/>converse with the bishop.")
('Priest Enel', "You don't have to worry about them. They certainly<br/>won't stop you from coming in and praying.")
('Priest Enel', "We're currently holding a memorial mass for all the<br/>lives that were lost in the attack on Creil Village.")
('Priest Enel', 'Many are mourning for our fallen Calvardian brothers<br/>and sisters...')
('Priest Enel', 'The bishop is hosting the mass. He will offer a<br/>few words of prayer so that they may find peace.')
('Priest Enel', 'Anyone who wants to pray alongside him is welcome.')
('Sister Beatrice', "We will be holding memorial mass today, but I don't<br/>expect to see many children there. It looks like they<br/>are being invited to some kind of event.")
('Sister Beatrice', "While it's important that we mourn for those who<br/>have passed on, I understand that we ourselves have<br/>to move on with our daily lives at some point.")
('Sister Beatrice', 'That event may help brighten the hearts of<br/>the children. Perhaps this opportunity is a gift from<br/>the Goddess Herself.')
('Sister Beatrice', "While Oración has a treasured history, it's true that<br/>there has been a lot of oppression towards minorities<br/>and the less fortunate over the years.")
('Sister Beatrice', "Since I started serving at the grand cathedral, I've<br/>seen many of those people's plights. It's...hard<br/>to witness.")
('Sister Beatrice', "That's why I would like to open up a facility where<br/>we can offer aid to those who are struggling.")
('Sister Beatrice', "I've been discussing the idea with the archbishop<br/>every day now. I have hopes it'll come to<br/>pass someday.")
('Sister Beatrice', "I can't believe Creil Village is...gone. Not even the<br/>children were spared...")
('Sister Beatrice', "I've looked after many kids in gospel facilities over<br/>the years, so this is heartbreaking for me...")
('Sister Beatrice', "We must protect the orphanage here at all costs.<br/>I've supported it for many years, and I won't let<br/>anything happen to it!")
('Sister Beatrice', "I'm sure there's a few people from Creil Village who<br/>have lost their families and homes...")
('Sister Beatrice', "I'd like to reach out to those people and help them in<br/>some way.")
('Sister Beatrice', "I'm already thinking about getting in touch with the<br/>church in the capital so we can figure out how we can<br/>support them.")
('Rosanna', "I'm here to pray again today. I was surprised to hear<br/>news of a fun event going on given all<br/>that's happened.")
('Rosanna', 'Perhaps the organizers are trying to cheer people up?')
('Rosanna', "If that's the case, I can admire that. It's put a smile<br/>back on my son's beautiful face, and if he's happy, so<br/>am I.")
('Rosanna', "When I heard the news of the tragedy, it didn't feel<br/>real at first.")
('Rosanna', "That's why I've come here. Both to pray and to<br/>face reality.")
('Rosanna', "Just because Oración is safe doesn't mean we can turn<br/>a blind eye to what happened. Doing that would<br/>be wrong.")
('Rosanna', "But it's still so difficult. I'm trying to put on a brave<br/>face for my son, but I'm not sure if it's all<br/>that convincing.")
('Harriet', "Everything's been super depressing lately, but that<br/>event sounds really fun! I even got invited!")
('Harriet', "And when Mommy told me to go have fun,<br/>she smiled! I haven't seen her do that in ages!")
('Harriet', "Apparently only kids get to go, so I've gotta have<br/>enough fun for Mommy, too! I want her to smile<br/>lots more!")
('Harriet', 'I go to the grand cathedral every week, but this time,<br/>everyone looks sad...')
('Harriet', 'Even Mommy looks down in the dumps...<br/>What should I do?')
('Harriet', "Should I act sad, too? No, that'd just make Mommy<br/>even sadder...")
('Irene', 'Apparently there was an incident upstairs. Did the<br/>president do something wrong?')
('Irene', 'The floor manager told me not to worry, but this<br/>seems like a big deal to me.')
('Irene', 'I had an inkling that something was happening<br/>behind closed doors in the Auclair family...')
('Irene', "The senior employees seem a little perturbed.<br/>Apparently, there's something going on with the<br/>president's family.")
('Irene', "Well, it's none of my business. It's not like it impacts<br/>my work.")
('Irene', 'Many places in Oración offer dishes that are similar<br/>to what was once served to the old Oración royalty.')
('Irene', "A chef's skills and the method of cooking are both<br/>important, but ingredients also have a tremendous<br/>effect on the quality of a dish.")
('Irene', 'First-class restaurants often order supplies from<br/>Belle-Forêt, and that should speak to the quality<br/>of our products.')
('Irene', 'Welcome to Belle-Forêt Fine Goods. Please take a<br/>look at what we have to offer.')
('Irene', 'The Quincy Company uses only the highest quality<br/>fruits and dairy products when making sweets.')
('Irene', 'We have our own supply routes that let us procure the<br/>best ingredients on the market.')
('Irene', "And those routes aren't impacted by the state of<br/>emergency, so we won't have any trouble with<br/>keeping our shelves stocked.")
('Chief Manager Parler', "The bond between the president and his daughter has<br/>been severed... I didn't think it'd end like this.")
('Chief Manager Parler', "Oh, if only I had listened to Elaine... Maybe this all<br/>could've been prevented.")
('Chief Manager Parler', "I can't believe the president was affiliated with<br/>the mafia. Though I'm not surprised to hear he had<br/>ties to an anti-immigrant faction.")
('Chief Manager Parler', 'I served him for a quarter of a century, but I<br/>never noticed... I feel like I failed everyone.')
('Chief Manager Parler', "Not too long ago, I spotted the president's daughter.<br/>She hadn't been home in some time.")
('Chief Manager Parler', 'She nodded at me and then disappeared. I thought<br/>she looked a little...distressed.')
('Chief Manager Parler', 'I wonder if it has something to do with her father...')
('Chief Manager Parler', "*sigh* I hope she's doing all right...")
('Chief Manager Parler', 'Oh, my apologies! I was a bit lost in thought.')
('Chief Manager Parler', "I heard rumors that House Auclair's estranged<br/>daughter had returned to Oración. I've known her<br/>since she was a little girl.")
('Chief Manager Parler', 'Welcome! How may I help you today?')
('Chief Manager Parler', 'You can find all sorts of sweets here.')
('Chief Manager Parler', "In fact, we've got all of our Quincy Bell sweets in<br/>stock right now.")
('Chief Manager Parler', 'They make for wonderful gifts—especially for that<br/>special someone. Why not buy a few packs?')
('Chief Manager Parler', 'We have plenty of affordable offerings these days, but<br/>we also sell premium goods that the old Calvardian<br/>royal family used to love.')
('Chief Manager Parler', 'In fact, we still receive orders from royalty abroad.')
('Chief Manager Parler', 'These sweets have been well liked by Eastern royal<br/>families for generations. One might say our products<br/>transcend national borders and cultures.')
('Mathilde', "What's going to happen to the Quincy Company?<br/>Are we all going our separate ways?")
('Mathilde', 'Many of us worked here for so long...')
('Mathilde', "Well, I don't suppose any of us will have trouble<br/>finding work elsewhere.")
('Mathilde', "But we gave our everything to this store.<br/>Walking away from all this won't be easy for any<br/>of us.")
('Mathilde', "Now that I think about it, this year's EGC should be<br/>starting up soon.")
('Mathilde', "It's quite the show for fashionistas such as myself.<br/>I was enthralled by the event in my younger days.")
('Mathilde', 'It helps expose aspiring fashion designers to all sorts<br/>of different styles.')
('Mathilde', "If a designer is stuck in the past or too focused on<br/>trend chasing, they'll never be able to make clothes<br/>that bring out a person's beauty.")
('Mathilde', 'The materials that go into clothing designs are crucial<br/>to their appeal.')
('Mathilde', 'High-quality, lightweight fabrics are soft to the touch<br/>and sit comfortably on your skin.')
('Mathilde', "Eastern silk and Central Eastern goat wool may be<br/>rare, but they're worth seeking out.")
('Mathilde', 'I hope more people will come to understand the<br/>importance of material quality in time.')
('Mathilde', "If you're looking for high-quality clothing, then look<br/>no further.")
('Mathilde', "Our ceremonial dresses are made with impeccable<br/>material quality. They're quite popular with the<br/>upper class.")
('Mathilde', 'Even tourists like to splurge here, as a matter of fact.')

('Mathilde', "It's also important to dress to impress—and there's<br/>nothing more impressive than our dresses.")
('Gaston', 'Elaine finally returned home, and then<br/>this happened...')
('Gaston', "I don't know what will become of the Quincy<br/>Company, but its fate will have no impact on<br/>my work.")

('Gaston', 'I heard from Chief Manager Parler that Elaine is<br/>here in Oración.')
('Gaston', 'I used to do maintenance work on her favorite sword<br/>back in the day.')
('Gaston', "I've heard about her many exploits as a bracer. It fills<br/>me with joy that her sword is being put to good use.")
('Gaston', "However, I'm still sad to hear that she's estranged<br/>from President Auclair...")
('Gaston', 'The man said he had business at Philibert Workshop.')
('Gaston', 'After that, a policewoman came up to me and asked<br/>about him.')
('Gaston', "That whole thing seemed kinda weird. Is something<br/>going on that I don't know about?")
('Gaston', "I think it's about time for me and the boys to do our<br/>routine repair work on Vashtar Palace's exterior.")
('Gaston', "It's an important piece of Oración history, so the<br/>artisans in the city do upkeep on it on a regular basis.")
('Gaston', 'Vashtar Palace was destroyed during the revolution,<br/>but we all believe it needs to be preserved for<br/>future generations.')
('Gaston', "I've helped repair its walls many times.")
('Gaston', 'Heya. I sell weapons and silverwork here.')
('Gaston', "I've been doing business in this department store for a<br/>long time, but our production methods haven't<br/>changed a bit.")
('Gaston', "The Quincy Company has been looking out for my<br/>little shop for a long time now. I'm indebted to them.")
('Gaston', "Anyhow, this style of craftsmanship was once loved<br/>by the nobility of old, and it's still popular today.<br/>I feel blessed, honestly.")
('Gaston', "There are many workshops dealing in silver<br/>accessories and swords. They're symbols of the<br/>old nobility.")
('Gaston', 'As time has passed and things have changed, so, too,<br/>did the workshops. They inherited traditional crafting<br/>methods and styles.')
('Gaston', "I'm happy that my workshop and the Quincy<br/>Company can work together to protect the old ways<br/>of doing things.")
('Security Guard Belfast', 'The police told me that President Auclair was<br/>working with an anti-immigrant group and<br/>the mafia...')
('Security Guard Belfast', "I couldn't believe what I heard... I wonder what's<br/>going to happen to me from here.")
('Security Guard Belfast', "I heard that the president's daughter was spotted near<br/>here, but she didn't come this way.")
('Security Guard Belfast', "She has been avoiding me since even before she<br/>left home... Why can she not understand her<br/>father's feelings?")
('Security Guard Belfast', "Is it true that President Auclair's daughter has<br/>returned to Oración?")
('Security Guard Belfast', 'I know she was estranged from her father...<br/>How unexpected.')
('Security Guard Belfast', "This elevator will take you to the Quincy<br/>Company's headquarters. If you have business there,<br/>you will need to schedule an appointment.")
('Security Guard Belfast', "Though the president has been busier than usual<br/>these past few days, so I doubt you'll be able to see<br/>him anytime soon.")
('Lovisa', 'What was with all of the commotion in the office<br/>above us?')
('Lovisa', 'It has thoroughly ruined my relaxing shopping spree.<br/>What is the Quincy Company thinking?')
('Lovisa', "I hope Rennes is having more fun than I am<br/>right now... Perhaps it's good that she went to<br/>that event.")
('Lovisa', "I'm surprised my daughter is interested in this sort<br/>of event.")
('Lovisa', "The fact that it's being sponsored by Central<br/>Easterners is making me a little wary, I'll admit.")
('Lovisa', "But if my daughter wants to go, I won't stop her.")
('Lovisa', "All right, sweetie. We're not going to let that dreadful<br/>news get between us and our shopping time.")
('Lovisa', "Remember, money's no object—you may buy whatever<br/>you'd like. We'll have the maids carry it all back<br/>home later.")
('Lovisa', "Since my stingy husband is nowhere to be found, I'm<br/>putting myself in charge of the family budget—and I<br/>say we're going to shop until we drop!")
('Lovisa', "Well, if you truly wish to go, then I won't stop you.<br/>Go enjoy yourself, sweetie.")
('Lovisa', "Wait, didn't they say the event is being sponsored by<br/>Central Easterners? Why would they...?")
('Rennes', "Oh, don't worry about that, Mama. Apparently the<br/>man behind it is, like, super rich and important<br/>and stuff!")

('Manager Delanoe', 'Guests from the Kowloon Group are staying here.<br/>Do you have business with them?')
('Manager Delanoe', "It's quite uncommon for such a large group from<br/>Kowloon to be staying here. I wonder if something's<br/>going on?")
('Manager Delanoe', "Well, I suppose it's not hard to imagine they have a<br/>lot to deal with, given the perilous nature of things as<br/>of late.")
('Manager Delanoe', "It's an honor that we're able to provide a place for<br/>them to do business.")
('Manager Delanoe', 'Welcome to Hotel Leclerc. Do you have business<br/>with one of our guests?')
('Manager Delanoe', "If you do, please talk to one of our staff members.<br/>They'll be able to connect you to them.")

('Receptionist Gelee', 'After the revolution, it was turned into a hotel.')
('Receptionist Gelee', 'But even now, we sometimes serve royal families and<br/>nobles from other nations.')
('Receptionist Gelee', "And it's times like those in which we are able to make<br/>use of the traditions we inherited from the days when<br/>this was a reception hall.")
('Receptionist Gelee', 'Greetings! Welcome to Hotel Leclerc.')
('Receptionist Gelee', "If you're here to book a room, then I'm sorry.<br/>You have to make reservations in advance.")
('Receptionist Gelee', 'The reservation system was put in place to ensure the<br/>safety of our guests. We hope you understand.')

('Banker Dupont', 'The unknowns in the current flow of mira could<br/>result in trust issues down the line...')
('Banker Dupont', "There's been some hubbub about the Oración Trust<br/>Bank lagging behind the banks in the capital<br/>and Langport.")
('Banker Dupont', "The people spreading that garbage need to look<br/>beyond the simple numbers. There's more to finance<br/>than assets and liabilities.")
('Banker Dupont', 'For example, the price of land in Oración is through<br/>the roof, as are the average savings of its citizens.<br/>Public trust is also high.')

('Bracer Kazan', "That whole thing with her father's a tough<br/>deal, though. If I were in her shoes, I probably<br/>wouldn't have wanted to confront him.")

('Renne', "It was kind of nice to catch up with Walter and<br/>Retzy. I've known them for a long time.")

('Elaine', 'I have already tendered my resignation. This will be<br/>my final job as a bracer.')
('Elaine', 'Do not think you can suppress my evidence. It will<br/>hold firm.')
('President Auclair', "How can you do this to me? You of all people should<br/>understand exactly what I'm trying to do here!")
('President Auclair', 'The blood of the marquises of the past flows through<br/>House Auclair... It is noble and pure!')
('President Auclair', "Everything I've done...is all for the purpose of<br/>righting the wrongs of that foolish revolution. I only<br/>want to take back what is rightly ours!")
('President Auclair', 'Why would you seek to obstruct such a<br/>righteous goal?!')
('Elaine', '...')
('Ashladd', 'What a pitiful man.')
('Elaine', '...Just tell me one thing.')
('Elaine', "Did you know about Almata's plans to destroy Creil?")
('Elaine', 'And also...were you privy to the danger that is being<br/>thrust upon the people of Oración?')
('President Auclair', 'I swear I knew nothing about Creil! They only told<br/>me their plan after the fact!')
('President Auclair', "W-Wait... Did you say...Oración is in peril? This is<br/>the first I'm hearing of this!")
('Ashladd', 'Hmm...')
('Elaine', 'I expected as much. Regardless, you can fill us in on<br/>everything you know at the guild—')
('Melchior', 'Ahaha! I LOVE a juicy family drama!')
('Elaine', '...?!')
('Ashladd', "If it isn't the overseers of the Gardens.")
('Arioch', 'Nice to see ya, vice captain.')
('Melchior', "Normally, I would not care about what you choose to<br/>do on the surface now that you're out of the game.<br/>Out of sight and out of mind.")
('Melchior', "However, I couldn't help but notice you harassing our<br/>poor sponsor. Did you stumble upon evidence that<br/>incriminates him, perhaps?")
('Elaine', 'You have some nerve.')
('President Auclair', 'O-Oh, thank goodness. Your timing is<br/>impeccable, Melchior!')
('President Auclair', "Finish off this intruder posthaste! Elaine is to be<br/>placed under house arrest effective immediately—but<br/>don't harm her!")
('Elaine', 'Father!')
('Ashladd', 'Witless fool...')
('Melchior', "*sigh* This wasn't on my agenda for today, but<br/>very well. However, I hope you know I don't believe<br/>in half-measures.")
('Elaine', 'Ugh!')
('President Auclair', 'Wh-What are you doing?!')
('Melchior', "Ahaha! I may be part of the mafia now, but I was<br/>once in a group of assassins, I'll have you know!")
('Melchior', 'If I see a chance to kill, I will not hesitate to act on it.<br/>I cannot resist my primal instincts! ♪')
('Arioch', "You might've got one over me earlier, but I won't<br/>make the same mistake twice. I'm not goin' easy on<br/>you just 'cause you're tired.")
('Arioch', "I'm gonna tear ya limb from limb!")
('Ashladd', 'Ugh...')
('Elaine', "I won't let anyone interfere with my mission. I will<br/>bring my father to justice, and there's nothing you can<br/>do to stop me!")
('Melchior', "I wouldn't be so sure of that, if I were you. ♪")
('President Auclair', 'Elaine!')
('Elaine', 'Father?!')
('Van', 'Hraaaaaah!')
('Judith', "Wh-What's going on?")
('Fie', "I don't know, but it doesn't look good.")
('Van', 'You all right, Elaine?!')
('Elaine', 'Van! Zin, Fie!')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Looks like we got here just in the nick of time.')
('President Auclair', 'I-I remember you. I saw you last night.')
('President Auclair', 'Wait. That hair looks...familiar. Have we met before?')
('Van', "I've never seen you before in my life. You sure you're<br/>not gettin' me mixed up with someone else?")
('Melchior', 'Well now! What a twist!')
('Melchior', "Though it isn't a welcome one. Now was the perfect<br/>time to bring down the curtain on the president's life.")
('President Auclair', 'Wh-What?!')
('Melchior', "Oh, don't act so surprised. Anyone with half a brain<br/>would have realized the boss had no interest in your<br/>silly anti-immigrant cause.")
('Melchior', 'We smiled and nodded so you would line our<br/>pockets, but we have no need for money anymore.<br/>You have outlived your usefulness.')
('Elaine', 'No wonder you were so quick to hand over<br/>those records.')
('President Auclair', "Th-This can't be happening...")
('President Auclair', 'Gah!')
('Elaine', 'F-Father!')
('President Auclair', 'E-Elaine...')
('Melchior', 'Well now! What a twist!')
('Melchior', 'Although, we were planning to bring down the<br/>curtain on your life anyway.')
('President Auclair', '...?!')
('Melchior', "Aww, don't act so surprised. Anyone with half a brain<br/>would've realized the boss had no interest in your<br/>silly anti-immigrant cause.")
('Melchior', 'We smiled and nodded so you would line our<br/>pockets, but we have no need for money anymore.<br/>You have outlived your usefulness.')
('Elaine', 'No wonder you were so quick to hand over<br/>those records.')
('President Auclair', "I'm so sorry, Elaine... I don't know how...I could have<br/>been so blind.")
('President Auclair', 'Please believe me when I say that you—')
('Elaine', 'Father!')
('Van', 'Hraaaaaah!')
('Van', 'You all right, Elaine?!')
('Elaine', 'Van... Zin, Fie...')
('Judith', "Wh-What's going on?")
('Fie', "I don't know, but it doesn't look good.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Yeah. Looks like we were a few moments too late.')
('Risette', 'We need to administer first aid right away!')
('Van', "(Damn it. If only I hadn't made the wrong call...)")
('Melchior', 'Heh. I never expected to see so many lovely faces<br/>here—especially with the final round on the horizon.')
('Melchior', 'Is the wait so unbearable? Are you bored? Well, I<br/>am, too. How about we entertain each other for a<br/>little while!')
('Aaron', "Fine by me. I'm gonna enjoy kicking your ass!")
('Feri', "We won't lose to you!")
('Quatre', "We won't let you have your way any longer!")
('Arioch', "I'll take on the vice captain and the bracers.")
('Arioch', "This'll be a nice warmup before the final round!")
('Ashladd', 'You were marked a heretic long ago—and now it is<br/>finally time to put you down!')
('Van', 'On your feet, Elaine!')
('Van', "Your dad's gonna be fine—he's still breathing!<br/>So stand up! Don't you wanna see this<br/>thing through?!")
('Van', "Elaine! Let's do this!")
('Van', "We'll talk about you runnin' off on your own later!<br/>You ready to see this thing through?!")
('Elaine', 'Of course!')
('Melchior', "Then let's get this exhibition match started! It'll be<br/>the perfect prelude to the big finale!")
('Melchior', "Don't go dropping dead on me now, or the boss will<br/>be VERY disappointed!")
('System', 'Select the first of the two characters who will fight<br/>alongside Van and Elaine.')
('System', 'Select the second of the two characters who will fight<br/>alongside Van and Elaine.')
('Elaine', 'Ugh!')
('Van', 'Elaine!')
('Melchior', '...Ahaha! Impressive! Very impressive!')
('Arioch', "Heh. You guys aren't half bad.")
('Zin the Immovable', "Gah... We just can't get the upper hand against him.")
('Ashladd', '(Master. The artifact he wields...)')
('Bergard', '(Yes, my thinking is the same.)')
('Risette', 'Everyone! We are out of time!')
('Melchior', 'Oh, dear. We may have overdone it a smidgen.')
('Melchior', "If the police learn of our plans, they'll blab them to<br/>everyone, and the boss wouldn't like that. He wants<br/>to keep a tight lid on spoilers.")
('Melchior', "Although, I'd love to see droves of panic-stricken<br/>civilians toppling over each other and screaming<br/>for mercy. It sounds like a perfect ending to me!")
('Quatre', 'You foul fiend!')
('Feri', "You're a monster.")
('Aaron', 'I hope you burn in hell, you son of a bitch.')
('Arioch', "We gotta hightail it outta here. I've still got a part to<br/>play in the game.")
('Judith', "What?! Don't run away, you coward!")
('Melchior', '*sigh* Our mission ended in failure... Though we did<br/>get something nice out of the exchange.')
('Melchior', 'How about we call this one a draw?')
('Melchior', "Be a doll and tell the president 'thanks for everything'<br/>for me—assuming he manages to make it back from<br/>death's door, of course. ❤")
('Melchior', "Thanks for everything, Mr. President. We couldn't<br/>have done any of this without you. Farewell, now! ❤")
('President Auclair', '...')
('Elaine', '...')
('Arioch', "To tell you the truth, I'm pretty damn happy you<br/>guys're the ones who'll be challenging us in<br/>the palace.")
('Arioch', "Wish it was three o'clock already. The anticipation's<br/>killing me here...")
('Arioch', "But the wait'll be worth it. See you guys soon!")
('Fie', 'We finally got rid of them. For now, at least.')
('Van', 'Yeah...')
('Elaine', 'Father!')
('President Auclair', '...')
('Risette', 'He still has a pulse, but his vitals are dropping rapidly.')
('Fie', 'We need to get him to a hospital ASAP!')
('System', 'Before long, an ambulance arrived on the scene and<br/>took Edmond Auclair to the hospital.')
('System', 'Emergency surgery was successful, but his condition<br/>remained critical, which meant he would not be<br/>regaining consciousness anytime soon.')
('System', 'After that, Elaine delivered all of the evidence she<br/>had to the authorities.')
('System', 'Edmond was then charged with aiding and abetting<br/>the mafia and providing material support to a terrorist<br/>organization—and placed under house arrest.')
('Elaine', '...')
('Van', "...We'll leave the rest to you.")
('Elaine', '...Right.')
('President Auclair', "I'm so sorry, Elaine... I don't know how...I could have<br/>been so blind.")
('President Auclair', 'But...please believe me when I say that...<br/>When I say that—')
('Elaine', 'Representative Director of the Quincy Company,<br/>President Edmond Auclair...')
('Elaine', 'I am taking you into custody on suspicion of aiding<br/>and abetting the mafia and providing material<br/>support to a terrorist organization.')
('System', 'Soon after, police arrived on the scene, and after<br/>concisely explaining the situation, Van contacted<br/>the CID.')
('System', 'After that, Elaine delivered all of the evidence she<br/>had to the authorities.')
('System', 'As a result, Edmond and his accomplices were placed<br/>under arrest.')
('Judith', "This whole thing has gotta be trying for her, but I get<br/>the feeling she'll be okay.")
('Van', "Yeah. She's made of sterner stuff. One way or<br/>another, she'll make it through.")
('Quatre', 'I was worried there for a moment, but I think it<br/>turned out all right in the end.')
('Feri', "I'm glad we were finally able to pay Elaine back for all<br/>the times she's helped us out of a jam.")
('Aaron', "Wish we could've finished off those bastards while we<br/>had the chance, though.")
('Risette', "Oh, I nearly forgot about the vice captain. Looks as<br/>though he's nowhere to be seen now.")
('Bergard', 'He may have assumed the branded heretic had room<br/>to mend his ways.')
('Van', "Here's hoping.")
('Van', "Either way, I'm sure the CID's got the situation<br/>under control.")
('Van', "Once we're all done here, we should get in contact<br/>with Agnès.")
('Judith', "Yeah. I think our patrol's just about over now.")
('Elaine', 'Wait a moment!')
('Elaine', 'Thank you, everyone. For coming to my aid—and for<br/>letting me settle this in my own way.')
('Elaine', "I regret that I won't be able to watch over your efforts<br/>to the very end. There is a lot I must go over with<br/>the authorities...")
('Elaine', 'But I know you will succeed. I believe in you all!')
('Elaine', 'I have faith that you and your friends will triumph!')
('Fie', "The big guy and I won't be going anywhere, though.<br/>We're sticking with you to the end.")
('Zin the Immovable', "The two of us are gonna give 120% to make up for<br/>Elaine's absence.")
('Van', "We'll kick this game's ass. You played your part to<br/>give us this chance at victory, and we're gonna take it.")
('Van', "We'll be back with good news before you know it!")
('Elaine', "Of course! I'll be waiting!")
('System', "To advance the main story, select 'Go to Vashtar<br/>Palace' from the Travel menu.")
('Cao', 'On that, you have nothing to fear, I assure you.<br/>We have no shortage of personnel.')
('Kincaid', 'Then proceed according to our agreement. We shall<br/>be accommodating to your needs—within reason,<br/>of course.')
('Cao', 'Many thanks. I hope this will serve as the start of a<br/>long, lasting relationship with your organization.')
('Kincaid', "Heh. Let's not get ahead of ourselves.")
('Cao', "Oh! If it isn't the good people of Arkride Solutions.")
('Aaron', "It isn't even lunchtime, and you're already up to<br/>no good.")
('Van', "Why the hell are you callin' René? What kinda<br/>bullshit are you two cookin'?")
('Kincaid', "I would thank you to not call me by my name while<br/>I'm on duty. Or even when I'm off, for that matter.")
('Agnès', 'Kincaid?')
('Feri', "Oh, that's the guy from the CID.")
('Judith', "He's a presidential aide, right?")
('Bergard', 'Tell me, why might a government official be having a<br/>friendly chat with an executive of Heiyue?')
('Cao', 'We were simply going over the events of<br/>this morning.')
('Agnès', "That's all?")
('Quatre', 'As in, what that Hercules unit did?')
('Kincaid', 'Indeed. To be more specific, we were forming an<br/>agreement to ensure that such an event does<br/>not repeat.')
('Kincaid', 'Desperate times call for desperate measures. After the<br/>incident, we realized a backup plan had to be put<br/>in place.')
('Risette', 'Does that mean Heiyue has already taken action?')
('Cao', "Yes, that's correct. We have men stationed all around<br/>the perimeter of Oración.")
('Cao', 'We originally planned to bring them inside the city as<br/>reinforcements, but as you know, the rules strictly<br/>forbid such a thing.')
('Cao', 'Not that there would be any point in doing so now,<br/>given that our team has been eliminated.')
('Cao', 'Not that there would be any point in doing so now,<br/>given that we have you at our side.')
('Van', "Makes sense. Guessin' you're planning to seize<br/>control of the city as soon as this is all done.")
('Cao', "The thought crossed my mind. Though there's no<br/>guarantee we would be successful, even if we did try.")
('Aaron', 'You really are a sneaky son of a bitch.')
('Kincaid', 'I want to ask you something, Van. Are you thinking<br/>up an escape plan for the people of Oración?')
('Kincaid', "If you are, I would advise against doing so. I know<br/>you're an expert at finding loopholes, but now is the<br/>time to hedge our bets.")
('Van', '...I know. That goes without saying.')
('Agnès', 'Van...')
('Van', "And while we're at it, I'll 'advise' you both to keep<br/>your schemin' to a bare minimum.")
('Van', "I know you glasses-wearin' types do that shit on the<br/>regular, but, uhh, stop.")
('Cao', "How rude! That sort of a caricature borders<br/>on prejudice. Wouldn't you agree, Kincaid?")
('Kincaid', "Don't put me in the same category as him...")
('Agnès', 'Ahaha...')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "Oh, it's been MUCH too long since we saw each<br/>other last. I've missed you ever so much!")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'I can hardly believe that our darling little Renne has<br/>grown into such a refined young lady. It brings a tear<br/>to my eye!')
('Renne', '*sigh* Still as melodramatic as ever, I see.')
('Renne', "You haven't changed at all, Retzy—and that goes for<br/>you as well, Walter. You really ought to learn how to<br/>dress like an adult.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Nah, screw that. I got myself a badass new bike, so<br/>I'm gonna dress the part.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Besides, at least I'm not a fashion disaster like this<br/>old asshole.")
('Renne', "That's par for the course with Ellroy. Though I do<br/>hear his behavior has worsened as the years have<br/>gone by.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "You don't know the half of it, sweetie. He has<br/>become increasingly temperamental—more so than<br/>even McBurn.")
('Harwood', "I'd appreciate it if you didn't compare me to<br/>that demon.")
('Harwood', "And I'm not the only one who's changed here.<br/>You have, too, Renne.")
('Harwood', 'For better and for worse.')
('Renne', "Why, thank you. That's the highest compliment I<br/>could receive from a man like you.")
('Renne', 'After all, you only have eyes for yourself, so I must<br/>have grown quite a bit if it made an impression<br/>on you.')
('Harwood', "Hey, now. I'm not that self-centered. Give me a little<br/>credit here.")
('Harwood', "Anyway, you can live your life however you please.<br/>It's no skin off my back if you seek a<br/>mundane existence.")
('Harwood', "But if you ever crave the life of the thrill again, give<br/>me a call. I'd be happy to challenge you in a game<br/>of slaughter.")
('Renne', "You're on. But fair warning: when it comes to<br/>slaughtering, I have no equal. ❤")
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Hoo, boy. Am I about to witness the throwdown of<br/>the century?')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "I'm not sure who I should root for. Would it be<br/>wrong to cheer them both on?")
('Van', "Y'all. This is a department store—not the world's<br/>bloodiest colosseum.")
('Renne', "Oh, I didn't even see you there.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'We meet again. Enjoying your morning stroll, I<br/>take it?')
('Harwood', "Good job yesterday. I've got a nice reward prepared<br/>for you, and that's more 4SPGs.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'Hello, everyone. Enjoying your morning stroll, I<br/>take it?')
('Harwood', "Good job coming out on top yesterday. I've got a nice<br/>reward prepared for you, and that's more 4SPGs.")
('Van', "Already aware. We'll take care of 'em.")
('Aaron', 'Having fun reconnecting with your found family?')
('Agnès', 'Aaron...')
('Renne', "We're just catching up, is all. I like to stay in touch<br/>with old friends.")
('Renne', "However, I do a good job keeping them at arm's<br/>length—unlike you with Heiyue.")
('Aaron', "Wow. That's a low blow.")
('Feri', "So what are you all doing here? This isn't exactly a<br/>normal meetup spot.")
('Walter the Direwolf', 'We all bumped into each other while buying stuff,<br/>and after checkout, we decided to shoot the shit for<br/>a while.')
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Renne purchased tea, I got boxing gloves, Lucrezia<br/>bought perfume, and the boss picked out some cigars.')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'One of my favorite perfumers sells their wares here,<br/>so I simply had to stop by.')
('Harwood', "I was fresh out of cigars. Would've been in hot water<br/>if this place didn't stock them, but I was in luck.")
('Harwood', 'Well, I think we should be heading back to base.')
('Bergard', "You're staying at the hotel near the North District's<br/>underground entrance, yes?")
('Walter the Direwolf', 'You got it. If you ever need me, drop by the bar there.')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "We'll see you all at noon!")
('Van', "Where are you guys staying, by the way? You're my<br/>clients, so I'd like to know where to reach out in case<br/>something comes up.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "The hotel in the North District. If you ever need me,<br/>you'll find me at their bar.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'I hope we see you again in the coming round.')
('Quatre', 'Whew... They may be friendly, but I always feel so<br/>tense around them.')
('Judith', "You always gotta watch out for those types, and that's<br/>especially true for the Oathbreaker.")
('Risette', 'Marduk has tentatively labeled him an<br/>SS-level threat.')
('Risette', 'And I only say tentatively because his background<br/>and day-to-day activities are a complete mystery—<br/>even to us.')
('Van', "I've heard bits and pieces, and they don't paint the<br/>most flattering picture, to put it nicely.")
('Agnès', "I'll have to be extra careful around him, then.")
('Renne', "I don't imagine he will cause you too many problems<br/>while you're working with them...")
('Renne', '...but you would do well to stay on guard around them<br/>all the same. Harwood especially.')
('Renne', 'Both Walter and Retzy are formidable opponents...')
('Renne', "...but compared with Harwood, they don't hold<br/>a candle.")
('Renne', "That's not to discount the other two, of course.<br/>They probably outmatch him in raw power.")
('Renne', "He's not a master martial artist like Walter, and he<br/>doesn't have any special powers like Retzy.")
('Renne', "However, he's still an Anguis, and you can never be<br/>too careful around them.")
('Renne', "I don't fully know what he's capable of, though, so<br/>that's about all the advice I can offer you.")
('Renne', "But I will share one little-known fact: the Thousand<br/>Oathbreaker isn't his only title.")
('Renne', "He's also known as the Savant Lawbreaker.")
('Quatre', 'That sounds...ominous.')
('Aaron', 'Any idea how he picked up that nickname?')
('Renne', 'Well, most groups that have stood in his way have<br/>reportedly—and conveniently—been silenced.')
('Renne', "Those cases were labeled as 'unfortunate accidents,'<br/>'inexplicable internal strife,' or something else to<br/>that effect.")
('Renne', 'One such case involved a company with criminal<br/>connections making a series of asinine mistakes,<br/>resulting in crippling debt and—ultimately—ruin.')
('Renne', "The authorities wrote off the deaths as 'cause<br/>unknown' or coincidental.")
('Renne', 'But if you ask anyone from the underworld about it,<br/>they will tell you those assessments are patently false.')
('Agnès', "So he commits all of these crimes, but he's never been<br/>charged with a single one of them.")
('Bergard', 'A slippery eel, that one.')
('Feri', 'His crimes will catch up to him sooner or later, right?')
('Van', '...')
('Renne', "Well, I should be getting back to the guild.<br/>They're completely swamped right now.")
('Renne', 'I wish you all luck. Make sure you come back safely,<br/>all right?')
('Agnès', 'We will!')
('Quatre', 'Thanks, Renne.')
('Agnès', '...What is it, Van? You look lost in thought.')
('Risette', 'Is something troubling you?')
('Van', 'Yeah.')
('Van', 'That conversation reminded me of something I<br/>forgot to make very clear to our clients.')
('Quatre', 'Oh?')
('Judith', 'What do you mean?')
('Van', "Don't worry about it. I just need to go see 'em before<br/>the second round begins.")
('Van', "We'll drop by the hotel bar later.")
('Aaron', "I'm down for that.")
('Bergard', 'We might benefit from another look around the<br/>area, too.')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'Oh! Master Bergard!')
('Dominion Celis', "So, you're with them now, huh?")
('Bergard', 'Indeed. I am aiding the spriggan and his friends with<br/>their work.')
('Dominion Celis', "If you guys're gettin' our master wrapped up in your<br/>criminal bullshit, I'll pummel your asses into<br/>the ground.")
('Van', "Hey, we ain't criminals. We're just handymen who<br/>help those in need. And our door's open to you both,<br/>too—assuming you got cash to burn.")
('Van', "Actually, I think I'd give you a sweet discount since<br/>you're fellow students of Master.")
('Dominion Celis', "'Fellow' students? Sorry, but there's no way in HELL<br/>we'll accept you as one of master's pupils. Not now,<br/>not ever.")
('Bergard', "You needn't be so harsh on him—nor should you<br/>worry about me. I have been rather enjoying myself,<br/>as a matter of fact.")
('Bergard', 'My time with them has served as a sobering reminder<br/>that there is still much I have yet to see and do in<br/>this world.')
('Feri', "Oh, by the way, where are Iscariot's people? I don't<br/>sense them anywhere.")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'They are probably lying low as we speak.')
('Dominion Celis', "Damn cowards. I was lookin' forward to laughing in<br/>their stupid faces for getting booted from the game.")
('Judith', 'We learned that they were beaten AND that there<br/>were two groups of them at the same time. It was a<br/>shocking one-two punch!')
('Dominion Celis', 'Probably tried a pincer attack on some team and got<br/>their asses handed to them anyway.')
('Dominion Celis', "What a bunch of freakin' losers.")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'Not to defend them, but our battle may have<br/>contributed to their loss. I imagine they were<br/>worn out.')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'If you go up against a team like Marduk with<br/>anything less than full strength, defeat is<br/>an inevitability.')
('Risette', 'So you believe they faced Marduk as well.')
('Feri', 'They fought Kasim, then...')
('Dominion Celis', "Those guys sound like they're off their rocker. I'd love<br/>to throw down with 'em someday.")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'Of course, we are not here to pick fights with<br/>unassailable opponents. We have another objective.')
('Agnès', "Oh, that's right. You're looking for something,<br/>aren't you?")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'As our master has no doubt informed you, the<br/>primary task of the Gralsritter is recovering and<br/>sealing away artifacts.')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'We assign top priority for cases like this—where they<br/>are being egregiously abused.')
('Dominion Celis', "It'd be awesome if we could bring down Almata at<br/>the same time, but that's not our main goal here.")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "That doesn't hold true for Iscariot, however.<br/>Their directive is the defeat—or rather, slaying—<br/>of heretics.")
('Quatre', 'The sword that mafia boss had in the video is an<br/>artifact, correct?')
('Bergard', '...I certainly believe so. All evidence available to us<br/>points to that fact.')
('Risette', "If I'm not mistaken, Melchior's dagger and bombs,<br/>Olympia's angel, and Arioch's armor and halberd are<br/>artifacts as well, yes?")
('Van', 'Think so, yeah.')
('Van', "Won't be easy to beat 'em with those things at<br/>their disposal.")
('Aaron', "Ugh. I thought artifacts were supposed to be rare.<br/>Feels like everyone and their mother's got one now.")
('Dominion Celis', 'Not wrong there.')
('Dominion Celis', "One artifact's usually bad enough, so the thought of<br/>dealin' with upwards of four is giving me a<br/>splitting headache.")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'Ordinarily, I would urge you to stay away from those<br/>miscreants, even if you emerge the victor...')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'However, we do not have the luxury of choice<br/>right now.')
('Dominion Celis', "I don't think we gotta worry. Our master's with 'em,<br/>so they're in good hands.")
('Bergard', "I'm not sure if I can compete against them without<br/>my Stigma, but I will do all that I can.")
('Bergard', 'However, regardless of how this game pans out...')
('Bergard', '...we will need your help in recovering and sealing<br/>away the artifacts at the end.')
('Bergard', 'I will be depending on you when that time comes.')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'Of course, Master.')
('Dominion Celis', "We won't let you down!")
('Van', "(He really is loved, ain't he?)")
('Feri', "Huh? Isn't that Agnès over there?")
('Quatre', "Huh? Isn't that Agnès?")
('Agnès', "All right. I'll help explain everything to the children.")
('Sister Beatrice', 'That would be best. As for the other sisters...')
('Risette', "I wonder what she's doing with one of the sisters of<br/>the church.")
('Judith', "I'm more curious about what they're talking about.")
('Aaron', "Probably about whatever plan she's brewing.")
('Quatre', "It's probably about whatever plan she's come up with.")
('Van', "Well, let's leave 'em to it. We don't need to get in<br/>her way.")
('Bergard', 'Yes. That would be best.')
('Aaron', 'A monster extermination request?')
('Quatre', 'And in the underground labyrinth...')
('Aaron', 'A monster extermination request?')
('Feri', 'And in the underground labyrinth...')
('Feri', 'A monster extermination request?')
('Quatre', 'And in the underground labyrinth...')
('Van', "We can go there whenever we want now that round<br/>three's over and done with.")
('Risette', "And since the game is no longer taking place there, it<br/>has likely been released from the Genesis' control.")
('Van', "I'm pretty sure we're the only ones who can enter the<br/>palace, but the rest of the groups are probably free to<br/>go down there now.")
('Judith', "Doesn't that mean civilians could get in there, too?")
('Bergard', "It's possible, which makes it all the more dangerous to<br/>let those monsters roam free.")
('Bergard', "Though I'm certain other groups will deal with them<br/>should we decide to pass on these requests.")
('Judith', 'Yeah, but we probably have the best lay of the land<br/>out of everyone here.')
('Van', "Fair point. We don't have much time, but if you guys<br/>want to take these on, I'm game.")
('Van', "I'm sure our other allies would like to join in on the<br/>fun, too.")
('Van', "Hey, you're Amalie, right?")
('Amalie', 'Umm... Yes? And who are you, exactly?')
('Van', "We're reporters. Local paper wants to do a piece on<br/>the upcoming recital at the opera house.")
('Van', "We'd like to ask you a couple of questions, if you<br/>don't mind.")
('Amalie', "Oh, all right. I suppose that makes sense.<br/>Our school's annual recitals always attract a lot<br/>of attention.")
('Quatre', "(So that's the story he's going with this time.)")
('Agnès', "(The fact that I'm getting used to this is a<br/>little frightening.)")
('Amalie', "I'd be happy to oblige. Ask me whatever you'd like.")
('Judith', "Well, let's get right into it, then. Could you tell us<br/>how the preparations for the recital have been going?")
('Amalie', 'Quite well, as a matter of fact.')
('Amalie', "This year's performance is shaping up to be even<br/>better than the last.")
('Aaron', 'Nice to hear.')
('Aaron', "Oh, yeah. Someone told me this year's leading lady is<br/>a Central Eastern gal. That true?")
('Amalie', "Yes, that's correct. Her name is Nelly.")
('Agnès', 'Are you two acquainted?')
('Amalie', 'Of course. We both attend the same music academy,<br/>after all.')
('Amalie', "However, I wouldn't exactly call us the closest<br/>of friends. Or friends at all, really.")
('Van', "Oh? Why's that?")
('Van', 'There some kinda bad blood between you two?')
('Amalie', "Oh, not at all. It's nothing like that...")
('Amalie', 'Though I do find her rather irritating, to be<br/>perfectly honest.')
('Amalie', 'In fact, just looking at her gets my blood boiling.')
('Feri', "(Sounds preeetty suspect... Think she's our culprit?)")
('Van', "(Not necessarily. Let's not jump the gun here.)")
('Quatre', "You aren't the first person who's said<br/>she's aggravating.")
('Quatre', 'It sounds like she may have a difficult personality.')
('Quatre', 'Perhaps this recital would be better off without her.')
('Amalie', "What? No. I don't agree with that at all.")
('Quatre', "You...don't?")
('Risette', "I'm surprised to hear that. We heard you would serve<br/>as her replacement should she step away.")
('Judith', "Are you saying you don't have any interest in being<br/>the lead?")
('Amalie', 'Of course I do.')
('Amalie', 'But the fact of the matter is, the school cast her in the<br/>lead role over me, and I have no reason to object to<br/>their decision.')
('Amalie', 'As much as it pains me to admit, Nelly is one step<br/>ahead of me—at the moment, anyway.')
('Amalie', 'If she were unable to perform, this entire recital<br/>would be in shambles.')
('Aaron', "Sounds like you think pretty highly of this girl.<br/>I thought you said you didn't like her.")
('Amalie', "I don't. Not one bit.")
('Amalie', 'Nelly is blessed with all these wonderful talents...')
('Amalie', "...and yet she withdraws into her shell time and again<br/>just because she's an immigrant.")
('Amalie', 'The other performers and I had no idea how to<br/>interact with her for a while.')
('Amalie', 'However, we were all struck by her determination and<br/>diligence in time. Everyone at the academy holds her<br/>in the highest regard.')
('Amalie', "But she's still so...self-loathing!")
('Amalie', 'Grr... That girl frustrates me to no end!')
('Amalie', "Why can't she just be more confident in herself?!<br/>Hmph!")
('Feri', '(Aww. She really cares about her.)')
('Aaron', "(This chick's only pretending to hate our client.<br/>What a waste of time.)")
('Agnès', "(Now, now. Don't be like that.)")
('Quatre', 'You said everyone at the academy respects her, yes?<br/>Does that include all the people in the recital as well?')
('Amalie', "That's right.")
('Amalie', "Everyone believes that we'll be able to pull off a<br/>tremendous performance with her at the center.")
('Van', "Sounds like she's pretty special.")
('Van', "I've got another question. Do you know anyone<br/>outside the recital who knows she's the<br/>lead performer?")
('Amalie', "Hmm? That's an odd thing to ask...")
('Amalie', "Well, it's not as though we've been keeping it a secret.")
('Amalie', "Although, we haven't officially announced the<br/>program or the performers yet.")
('Amalie', "So while I'm not surprised reporters such as<br/>yourselves are in the know, I don't think many are<br/>aware that Nelly is the lead.")
('Amalie', 'Oh, actually, there is one person who knows. A man<br/>running a survey asked me some questions about the<br/>recital not too long ago.')
('Bergard', 'Hmm. Can you tell us more about him?')
('Amalie', 'Certainly. He was running a survey in the North<br/>District marketplace.')
('Amalie', 'As I recall, it was about racial harmony and the<br/>immigrants living in Oración.')
('Amalie', 'During the survey, he asked me if I had any detailed<br/>anecdotes regarding the theme.')
('Amalie', 'He seemed to be supportive of immigrants, so I told<br/>him about Nelly and the recital.')
('Amalie', "I'm afraid I can't think of anyone else who might<br/>know about her, though.")
('Van', "That's all right. You've been a huge help, so thanks.")
('Amalie', 'Any time. Best of luck with writing your article.')
('Amalie', 'Good day.')
('Judith', 'Well, we did learn a lot, at least.')
('Quatre', 'Unfortunately, we lost our only lead in the process...')
('Van', "Before we start worryin' about that, let's report back<br/>to Nelly.")
('Van', 'Well, this is the place.')
('Feri', "I just realized we don't know which group is using<br/>this entrance.")
('Agnès', 'I imagine Renne has looked into it already.<br/>Should we ask her?')
('Aaron', "We don't got the time for that.")
('Judith', "I didn't see anyone who looked like our tourists on<br/>our way over. They might already be inside.")
('Van', 'Yeah. They probably are.')
('Van', "All right, you guys. There's no telling what'll happen<br/>in there, so stay on guard.")
('Secretary Inno', "Ah, you must be the fixers. I've been awaiting<br/>your arrival.")
('Secretary Inno', "My name is Inno. I'm the executive assistant to the<br/>president of ETWS.")
('Van', "You're the one who issued the request, yeah?<br/>Mind tellin' us more about it?")
('Agnès', "Can you fill us in on who you're looking for?")
('Secretary Inno', "Certainly. We're trying to find the president's<br/>grandson, Lucio, and his friends.")
('Van', "Wait. Ain't that the name of that High Bloods brat?")
('Secretary Inno', 'Ah, so you know him.')
('Judith', 'You mentioned in your request that they<br/>went missing.')
('Judith', "When's the last time you heard from him?")
('Secretary Inno', "That's not the issue. Even if he had gone a month<br/>without contacting us, we wouldn't consider that a<br/>cause for concern.")
('Secretary Inno', 'Lucio spends most of his time riding with his friends<br/>and causing trouble every which way, so he rarely ever<br/>comes home.')
('Feri', 'So why put out a missing person request?')
('Secretary Inno', 'We received a call from Lucio a few hours ago.')
('Secretary Inno', "There was a lot of interference, so we couldn't make<br/>out what he was saying. Then the call was abruptly<br/>cut off.")
('Secretary Inno', 'I tried to call him back several times after the fact, but<br/>there was no response.')
('Agnès', "That's definitely concerning.")
('Aaron', "You sure he wasn't just screwing with you?")
('Secretary Inno', "That's entirely possible.")
('Quatre', 'It is...?')
('Secretary Inno', 'However, just before the call ended, I swear I heard<br/>him say...')
('Secretary Inno', "...'Save me.'")
('Secretary Inno', 'After discussing the matter with the president, we<br/>decided to request your assistance.')
('Bergard', 'If what you say is true, then we must act swiftly.')
('Agnès', 'Have you considered contacting the guild or the<br/>police about this?')
('Secretary Inno', 'I discussed that possibility with the president.')
('Secretary Inno', 'He determined that this was a matter that<br/>required discretion.')
('Secretary Inno', 'If the media catches wind of this, it could turn into<br/>quite the scandal.')
('Judith', "Oh, so the president values the company's reputation<br/>over his own grandson's safety.")
('Secretary Inno', "Please don't hold his decision against him. He's in a<br/>position of responsibility, so he's stuck between a rock<br/>and a hard place here.")
('Risette', 'What should we do, Mr. Arkride?')
('Secretary Inno', 'Will you look for Lucio and his friends?')
('Van', "Doesn't sound like y'all have too many people to<br/>turn to...")
('Van', 'Sorry, but can you give me some time to think it over?')
('Secretary Inno', 'Ah... Yes, I suppose that will be fine.')
('Secretary Inno', "Let me know when you've come to a decision.")
('Van', "Sure. We'll take the job.")
('Van', "Not every day you get a request from the family that<br/>runs ETWS. Hope you've got a nice reward in store<br/>for us.")
('Secretary Inno', 'Of course.')
('Feri', "So where should we start looking? What if they've<br/>already left Oración?")
('Aaron', 'Then the High Bloods are as good as gone.')
('Quatre', "Let's not go there just yet. We haven't even begun<br/>our investigation.")
('Quatre', "I'd like to inspect the data on the phone that received<br/>Lucio's call. May I see it?")
('Quatre', "I promise I won't look at anything unrelated.")
('Secretary Inno', 'Understood. Let me go fetch it.')
('Secretary Inno', 'Here you are.')
('System', 'Quatre took the communication device from Inno.')
('Secretary Inno', "I need to return to my work, so I'll leave the rest of<br/>this to you.")
('Secretary Inno', "Good luck with your search. I hope you'll find Lucio<br/>safe and sound.")
('Van', 'You find anything out?')
('Quatre', "Not yet. It'll take me a while to analyze this on<br/>my own.")
('Risette', 'Would you like me to assist?')
('Quatre', "Oh, that'd be great.")
('Quatre', 'Got it!')
('Quatre', "The signal from the source transmission is weak, but<br/>fortunately for us, there aren't any devices interfering<br/>with the connection.")
('Quatre', "Pinpointing their location was much easier than I<br/>thought it'd be.")
('Aaron', 'So where are they at?')
('Quatre', "They're in the North District. We'll find them in the<br/>labyrinth entrance that's next to the exchange shop.")
('Quatre', 'That just so happens to be the entrance the society<br/>was going to use.')
('Quatre', 'That just so happens to be the entrance the society<br/>is using.')
('Judith', 'What? Is the society involved in this?!')
('Van', "I guess it's not impossible.")
('Van', "But I don't think they'd waste their time messin' with<br/>some punk-ass kids.")
('Bergard', 'Regardless, I suggest we make haste.')
('Agnès', "Right. Let's head over there!")
('System', 'Quest Lost Lord Lucio started!')
('Van', 'Okay, so we need to figure out the height of<br/>this place.')
('Feri', "It's gotta be in the triple digits for sure!")
('Agnès', "That wouldn't surprise me. Apparently, this is the<br/>largest church in all of Calvard.")
('Bergard', "This place is just as magnificent as the Empire's<br/>Heimdallr Cathedral.")
('Judith', 'So should we go in and ask one of the sisters about<br/>the height?')
('Quatre', "I don't think that will be necessary.")
('Quatre', 'Can you get us the measurements, FIO?')
('FIO', 'Of course, Quatre.')
('Quatre', "Then we'll leave it to you.")
('FIO', 'Understood.')
('FIO', 'Measurement scan complete.')
('Quatre', 'Nicely done. So what is it?')
('FIO', '184.34 arge.')
('FIO', 'The sensors were set to round to the<br/>hundredths place. I can also retrieve a more<br/>exact measurement.')
('FIO', 'Shall I change my settings and repeat the scan?')
('Quatre', "No, that's okay. We don't need that large of<br/>a number.")
('Agnès', 'FIO sure is useful.')
('Risette', 'Indeed. Orbal drone technology has come a long way.')
('Aaron', 'Way to go.')
('FIO', 'FIO is smart!')
('Feri', 'Yep. The smartest!')
('Van', "They're basically one of the team now, aren't they?")
('System', 'After returning to the surface, Damian, Tebo, and<br/>Roger took their leave.')
('System', 'Everyone else made their way over to the hotel.')
('Secretary Inno', 'Lucio!')
('Secretary Inno', "Thank goodness you're all right.")
('Secretary Inno', 'I heard all about what happened. It sounds like you<br/>were in a lot of danger.')
('Lucio', "Yeah, well, we got out safely—and I guess I've got all<br/>of you to thank for that.")
('Lucio', "Where's Grandfather?")
('Secretary Inno', "He's tied up with work at the moment, so he wasn't<br/>able to be present...")
('Judith', 'Are you kidding me?')
('Judith', "For all he knew, his grandson's life was at risk!<br/>He should've made time to come here and see that he<br/>was okay!")
('Lucio', "Hmph. He's probably delivering a toast at some<br/>dinner party as we speak.")
('Lucio', 'The man values his company and his mira above all<br/>other things—including his own family.')
('Lucio', "I'm sure the reason he didn't contact the bracers or<br/>the cops was to protect his company's reputation.")
('Lucio', "He doesn't give a damn about what happens to me.")
('Aaron', 'Oh, I get your deal now. You turned into a High<br/>Bloods punk just to get back at your grandpop.')
('Aaron', 'I see this kinda thing happen all the time.')
('Lucio', "Shut up. I may be grateful to you guys for saving us,<br/>but that doesn't mean I want you sticking your noses<br/>into my business.")
('Van', 'Well, at least you got one person who was worried<br/>about ya.')
('Van', "And that's your secretary friend right there.")
('Van', 'He might not show it on his face, but I could tell he<br/>was a bundle of nerves.')
('Lucio', 'Really?')
('Secretary Inno', "...That's ridiculous.")
('Quatre', "(He isn't fooling anyone.)")
('Agnès', '(Heehee. No, he is not.)')
('Secretary Inno', 'Anyhow, you have completed my request.<br/>Excellent work, everyone.')
('Secretary Inno', 'I will wire the money to you momentarily.')
('Secretary Inno', 'Now, then, Lucio. I have prepared a meal for you.<br/>Follow me.')
('Lucio', 'R-Right.')
('Feri', 'Another successful job in the bag!')
('Van', 'Yeah...')
('Risette', 'Hmm? Is something the matter, Mr. Arkride?')
('Bergard', "You're thinking about the bomb from earlier, yes?")
('Van', "...Uh-huh. There's somethin' that doesn't add up<br/>about it.")
('Quatre', "I'm glad I wasn't the only one who thought so.")
('Van', "I just can't make heads or tails about why Melchior<br/>didn't use real explosives.")
('Van', "Even if he was only prankin' those kids, it's out of<br/>character for him to use fakes.")
('Van', "After all, he doesn't give a shit about human life.")
('Van', "If he went out of his way to set those things up,<br/>there's no way he wasn't dead set on killing 'em.")
('Aaron', 'But he spared them anyway.')
('Feri', "Yeah, that's definitely weird.")
('Agnès', "Do you have any idea why he would've changed<br/>his mind?")
('Van', "Not really, and I don't think there's much point<br/>rackin' our brains about it.")
('Van', "Our work here's done, so let's get a move on.")
('Quatre', "(Huh? What's he doing here?)")
('President Auclair', 'Hmm?')
('Van', "What's with the staring? Something on my face?")
('President Auclair', "Hmph. I didn't know they let punks run amok here.<br/>The quality of this establishment has plummeted in<br/>recent years.")
('Van', 'Hah. What a jackass.')
('Van', '(...Glad we avoided him.)')
('Agnès', "That's the second time we've run into Elaine's<br/>father today.")
('Van', "Given his expression, I don't think he knows Elaine's<br/>back yet.")
('Van', '(Why would he be here at this hour...?)')
('Van', "(No, I can't dwell on this right now.)")
('President Daltie', 'Thank you for coming, Mr. Auclair.')
('President Auclair', 'So what was this urgent matter you wanted<br/>to discuss? Is it regarding that third-rate activist?')
('President Daltie', "I'm afraid so. I never thought he'd be such a liability.")
('President Auclair', 'How many times did I warn you to keep a tight lid on<br/>your connection to him?')
('President Daltie', 'Urgh... I know, I know.')
('President Auclair', "Well, no matter. We'll deal with him later.")
('President Auclair', "There are other people I'm more concerned about<br/>right now...")
('Ashladd', 'I knew it. Edmond Auclair...')
('System', 'Quest Lost Lord Lucio completed!')
('System', 'Earned')
('System', 'Received')
('Van', "Hey, we're from Arkride Solutions.")
('Van', "Mind if we ask you somethin'?")
('Van', 'Did you happen to see a man in a suit and a female<br/>police officer recently?')
('Gaston', 'Yeah, I did. About twenty minutes ago.')
('Gaston', 'The two of them had basically just missed each other.')
('Aaron', 'Did the guy in the suit say where he was going?')
('Gaston', 'Yep. He said he had business at Philibert Workshop.')
('Gaston', 'The officer asked where he was headed shortly after.')
('Gaston', "She must've been trying to follow him.")
('Gaston', "You think he might be some kinda criminal?<br/>What's going on?")
('Agnès', "That's what we're trying to find out. But please<br/>don't worry! We'll take care of it.")
('Quatre', 'Our next stop is Philibert Workshop, yes?')
('Van', "Yeah. I think that's in the South District.")
('Van', "It's interesting that he mentioned where he was<br/>going again. Startin' to think it's a deliberate move on<br/>his part.")
('Judith', 'You think?')
('Aaron', "This is the second time he's told a shopkeeper where<br/>he was headed.")
('Aaron', "It could've just come up in the middle of their<br/>conversation, but the fact that that happened twice<br/>is weird.")
('Judith', 'True enough, I guess.')
('Judith', 'But why would he leak that info when he knows<br/>someone might be following him...?')
('Judith', 'Wait!')
('Bergard', "I believe you just answered your own question: he<br/>likely noticed he was being followed, and now he's<br/>luring the officer into a trap.")
('Bergard', "Considering the cunning nature of his plan, we can<br/>surmise that we're dealing with someone from<br/>the underworld.")
('Feri', "B-But that means she's in danger!")
('Van', "It's a little early to be jumpin' to conclusions.<br/>We don't know that for sure.")
('Van', 'That said, we should probably hurry on over to<br/>Philibert Workshop.')
('Risette', 'Agreed.')
