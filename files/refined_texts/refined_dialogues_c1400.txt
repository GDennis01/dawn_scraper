('Francois', 'Aramis students are really tough, despite everything.')
('Francois', "That girl with the short hair in particular. A natural<br/>leader, that one. Won't budge at all.")
('Francois', "I'm honestly impressed. The future's in good hands,<br/>with kids like these.")
('Francois', "I'm really happy Eve showed up.")
('Francois', 'Madelaine really likes Apollo, too.')
('Francois', "Today's the Revolution Festival, so things will be<br/>very busy. Take care of yourself, okay?")
('Francois', "The Revolution Festival is almost upon us. I can't be<br/>all depressed at a time like this!")
('Francois', "I've been pretty down ever since I heard the news, but<br/>it does lift my mood a little seeing all the students<br/>enjoy themselves.")
('Francois', "Young people's happiness is so infectious. Isn't<br/>that funny?")
('Francois', "We need to set an example as adults. Kids won't be<br/>able to greet the new year right if we're all gloomy!")
('Madelaine', 'Myaaau.')
('Madelaine', 'Myaaau. *purr*')
('Francois', "These dears are always willing to get close to me<br/>when I'm anxious.")
('Francois', 'I guess even kittens can tell how people feel.')
('Madelaine', 'Meow!')
('Hopkins', "It's been more than ten years since I retired, but I still<br/>know the basics of combat.")
('Hopkins', "I'd have no regrets if my last service was to protect the<br/>people of this city.")
('Hopkins', "The young'uns seem capable, so I could probably just<br/>leave things to them, but I don't want to just sit back.")
('Hopkins', 'A nationwide memorial, huh? I guess all we can really<br/>do for the dead is mourn them.')
('Hopkins', "But announcing that at the same time as the<br/>president's shiny new weapon feels tone-deaf.")
('Hopkins', "I can't help but feel anxious. We still don't really<br/>know what weapon was used to destroy Creil Village.")
('Hopkins', 'Even if the perpetrators were captured, what<br/>happened in Creil cannot be undone.')
('Hopkins', "I'd been there a few times before, since I used to be<br/>border patrol.")
('Hopkins', 'I risked my life to defend that place. And to think<br/>about what happened to it...')
('Hopkins', "That's a horrifying weapon that the mafia used.")
('Hopkins', "First it was Crossbell's new weapon from last year,<br/>and now this. How much farther will we take these<br/>ghastly weapons?")
('Hopkins', "At this rate, I hope we don't end up destroying the<br/>entire continent.")
('Eve', "Apollo's going to protect us!")
('Eve', "And that old man's gonna stand guard in front of<br/>the store!")
('Eve', "W-We're safe. It's all gonna go back to<br/>normal...right?")
('Eve', 'I befriended Francois while we were out on a walk.')
('Eve', 'Well, more like Apollo and Madelaine did...')
('Eve', "Oh, whatever! I'm happy I got to enjoy some time<br/>with my neighbors!")
('Eve', 'Wow, what a sight! You can see the whole front of<br/>the station!')
('Eve', "Come on, Apollo! You bark and I yell 'hello!'")
('Apollo', 'Woof?')
('Eve', 'I was just taking a walk around the urban part of<br/>town for a change of pace.')
('Eve', 'Kinda surprised to find a basketball court here.')
('Eve', 'How about it, Apollo? Want to play ball?')
('Apollo', 'Woof, woof!')
('Eve', "Let's walk around here today, Apollo!")
('Apollo', 'Woof, woof!')
('Eve', "Haha! You're always so energetic!")
('Eve', 'Happy Revolution Festival, Francois!')
('Francois', 'Oh, goodness. Hello, Eve! Happy festival, darling.')
('Francois', 'Out alone today again? I really appreciate when<br/>you visit...')
('Francois', "...but it's the Revolution Festival today. Shouldn't you<br/>be spending it with your family?")
('Eve', "Well, my parents are busy. And it's more fun<br/>spending time with Apollo!")
('Eve', "I'm gonna go have fun visiting the cathedral and<br/>the pâtisserie!")
('Francois', "I see, I see. Well, there's gonna be a lot of people<br/>around, so be careful!")
('Apollo', '*whine* Grrrrr!')
('Madelaine', 'Meow, meow!')
('Apollo', 'Woof! *howl* Woofwoof!')
('Eve', "Who's a good boy? Oh, yes, it's you! Come<br/>on, Apollo! Let's take a walk around<br/>the neighborhood!")
('Apollo', 'Woofwoof! Woof!')
('Eve', "What's that? You wanna go play with your friend?")
('Eve', "Okay, okay. We'll stop by at the end of the walk!")
('Officer Sergi', "The Auber District might be free now, but there's<br/>still some frozen people around.")
('Officer Sergi', "Most of the embassy staff and Elsaim's envoys are<br/>still frozen.")
('Officer Sergi', "We'll continue to provide security, regardless of how<br/>long this anomaly takes to go away.")
('Officer Sergi', "I will protect the people of the embassy. I hope you'll<br/>do your part.")
('Officer Sergi', 'The high-ranking officials from the principality that<br/>came for the festival are in the embassy.')
('Officer Sergi', 'Sadly, the grand prince and the princess were not able<br/>to come this year.')
('Officer Sergi', 'Regardless of that, they were still able to send a<br/>telegram wishing for a long and healthy relationship<br/>with us.')
('Officer Sergi', "Prince Sherid, who's come for the Revolution<br/>Festival, is staying in this embassy.")
('Officer Sergi', 'He comes and goes ever so often. He has been<br/>enjoying sightseeing around Edith.')
('Officer Sergi', "It's a little concerning, to be frank, even though I<br/>know he has Ms. Naje as an escort.")
('Officer Sergi', "But I can't deny that it's quite charming to see the<br/>prince cut loose.")
('Officer Sergi', 'Him being so easygoing has made him well liked<br/>amongst the embassy staff.')
('Holland', "Never thought you'd end up rescuing me, Van.<br/>You have my thanks.")
('Holland', 'I honestly panicked when this whole thing started,<br/>but at least I managed to make sure people nearby<br/>were safe.')
('Holland', "I'll do what I can for now. Though there's not much I<br/>can offer you save for some sugary snacks.")
('Holland', "But I guess you're not one to turn your nose up at<br/>those, eh?")
('Holland', "Business is always good around the festival, but this<br/>year's looking to break a record or two.")
('Holland', 'We might have to thank the orbal net for getting<br/>word around. We got a lot of tourists, too.')
('Holland', "I'm glad to see people enjoying themselves. I just<br/>hope I don't run out of stock...")
('Holland', 'Got something set aside for regulars, of course.')
('Holland', 'Why, hello, Agnès and...')
('Holland', "Why, it's Van! Van, you rascal! I haven't seen you in<br/>quite some time!")
('Agnès', "I guess it would make sense that you'd know Holland.")
('Agnès', "Considering what you'll do for their treats, it's really<br/>no surprise you'd come before, Van.")
('Van', "Yeah, but I haven't been around in a long while.<br/>How the hell do you still remember me?")
('Holland', "It's my job! My customers' gratitude carries me<br/>forward in the art of confectionary. I make the best<br/>sweets for their enjoyment.")
('Holland', 'And no one enjoys them as much as you do! I could<br/>never forget someone so passionate for my sweets.')
('Van', "There's somethin' nice about being remembered, even<br/>if I haven't been here in forever.")
('Van', "You haven't lost your touch. I've had stuff from<br/>Andalucía since and it's still great.")
('Van', "I think I'll swing by more often, if I have the time.")
('Holland', 'Feel free to do so! Regulars like you make getting up<br/>in the mornings worth it.')
('Holland', 'Though I never would have imagined that the<br/>two of you would walk through my door together.')
('Holland', 'Wait, was that package Agnès bought this summer<br/>for you?')
('Agnès', "That's a good guess.")
('Holland', 'Small world out there, huh.')
('Holland', "Well, I'll be busier than ever since the festival's almost<br/>here, but I don't want you taking that as an excuse to<br/>not come by!")
('Van', "Sure thing, man. I'll fit in a visit or two.")
('Holland', "The year's been rough, but I wasn't expecting to cap it<br/>off by seeing an old regular.")
('Holland', "I don't know what you've been up to since I last saw<br/>you, but I do remember you very well from back then.")
('Holland', "Even though you always looked embarrassed to be<br/>here, you'd have the biggest smile anytime you<br/>ate anything.")
('Lisa', "It's my duty to help them as an Andalucía devotee.")
('Lisa', 'This will all end eventually, and the store will soon<br/>return to normal!')
('Lisa', 'I shall do the utmost for Holland. And then I will be<br/>able to enjoy my bounty once everything is resolved!')
('Lisa', 'The Revolution Festival is awfully busy this year.<br/>I guess more and more people outside the country are<br/>becoming acquainted with it.')
('Lisa', "Holland's probably gonna clean up store. It'll be a<br/>hard endeavor, still, with these many people.")
('Lisa', 'If Holland were to collapse from overworking, that...<br/>That would be unacceptable!')
('Lisa', "My ardent passion shone through today as I bought<br/>one of Holland's masterpieces!")
('Lisa', 'Holland endeavors wholeheartedly every day to<br/>deliver us the sweetest treats.')
('Lisa', "It's our duty as customers to put our body and soul<br/>into purchasing and enjoying his confections!")
('Priest Alfred', 'I managed to get in touch with the Old Town church<br/>and the Riverside temple.')
('Priest Alfred', "I'm not sure why, but Sister Philia is over<br/>in Riverside.")
('Priest Alfred', "She's been putting in a genuine effort to secure the<br/>local citizenry. We ought to follow her example.")
('Priest Alfred', 'The blessing of the Goddess will surely be with you.<br/>Please do be careful!')
('Priest Alfred', 'As I understand, this cathedral is being protected by<br/>an invisible barrier.')
('Priest Alfred', "It should deny entry to any of these devils, but we<br/>mustn't rest on our laurels.")
('Priest Alfred', 'Please do be careful. And mind that boy we spoke of.')
('Priest Alfred', "The festival has come at last. We'll be holding a<br/>memorial service in the cathedral for Creil Village.")
('Priest Alfred', 'What a horrible tragedy it was. And yet life goes on,<br/>and we must move along with it.')
('Priest Alfred', 'Our part is to mourn the dead, not be left behind<br/>with them or they will never find peace. May we all<br/>be blessed by the Goddess.')
('Priest Alfred', "Welcome to Edith Grand Cathedral. We're currently<br/>holding a memorial mass for Creil Village.")
('Priest Alfred', 'There will also be a memorial service during<br/>the festival. Many will come to pay their<br/>respects then.')
('Priest Alfred', "It isn't terribly busy right now, which might be ideal<br/>for those of a weary heart that might want to mourn<br/>in a more reserved manner.")
('Priest Alfred', 'I do wonder whether Sister Philia will be able to<br/>handle things, what with the large ceremony<br/>coming up...')
('Priest Alfred', "Sister Philia confessed this morning, but I'm not<br/>sure what it was about.")
('Priest Alfred', "Still, her faith is unquestionable. I'm sure she will<br/>overcome it.")
('Priest Watson', "Now that we've gotten a better grasp of the situation<br/>in the local churches, we'll start moving to help those<br/>in need.")
('Priest Watson', 'We have plenty of water, food, and blankets stocked<br/>up, but it might not be enough.')
('Priest Watson', "I'll go wherever is needed.")
('Priest Watson', 'You need not fear for me. There are plenty who will<br/>support me.')
('Priest Watson', 'We are fortunate to have Mother Celis of the<br/>Congregation here, along with Professor Hamilton.')
('Priest Watson', 'While I do have some mixed feelings about it, right<br/>now our priority must be cooperating to overcome<br/>this crisis.')
('Priest Watson', 'The Goddess of the Sky has no forgiveness for<br/>such villainy.')
('Priest Watson', 'As it so happens, I often travel around the Republic<br/>as liaison to their churches.')
('Priest Watson', 'On this day, every church will be holding a memorial<br/>mass alongside their festival celebrations.')
('Priest Watson', "We've made it this far despite everything. For that,<br/>we should be grateful.")
('Priest Watson', "Well, then. I'd best touch base with the archbishop<br/>about the state of things in Oración.")
('Priest Watson', "I've been observing the situation there over the last<br/>week, and things have thankfully calmed down.")
('Priest Watson', 'That arrest amongst the elites has caused quite the<br/>turmoil, but the archbishop has put in a lot of effort<br/>to calm the situation.')
('Priest Watson', '...Though they still seem rather hostile to Edith<br/>Grand Cathedral.')
('Bishop Orwell', "We've gotten in contact with most churches across<br/>the city, but the Vantail District one is a<br/>different story.")
('Bishop Orwell', "The Congregation for the Sacraments and the<br/>Gralsritter might've decided to act alone.")
('Bishop Orwell', 'Considering the Pandemonium and all the devils<br/>manifesting, things might just...')
('Bishop Orwell', 'Well, no use in dwelling right now. Hope for the<br/>best, prepare for the worst.')
('Bishop Orwell', "Never in my life could I have imagined I'd see a<br/>genuine devil.")
('Bishop Orwell', "But we've a duty to uphold to all those who've taken<br/>refuge here.")
('Bishop Orwell', 'We will pray for their sake, and for your victory.')
('Bergard', 'You can be assured we will find the means to put a<br/>stop to this.')
('Bishop Orwell', "It's almost time for the memorial service.<br/>Archbishop Jerome should be arriving shortly.")
('Bishop Orwell', 'So many people are suffering... Especially those<br/>affected by the tragedy of Creil Village...')
('Bishop Orwell', 'Let us pray for the Goddess to bless them all.')
('Bishop Orwell', 'These are the new choir members for the<br/>Revolution Festival.')
('Bishop Orwell', "As always, I'm in charge of the choir.")
('Bishop Orwell', "The festival draws near, so let's give it our best effort.")
('Bishop Orwell', 'The Congregation for the Sacraments should be able<br/>to handle things, at least to a certain extent.')
('Bishop Orwell', 'You and Bergard should take some time to rest.')
('Bishop Orwell', 'You and your team should take some time to rest.')
('Sister Orze', "We were able to contact the Riverside temple and<br/>confirm Sister Philia's safety. She's been<br/>helping them.")
('Sister Orze', 'Churches and other businesses have been doing what<br/>they can to help those that can still move.')
('Sister Orze', "Still, this situation will definitely be felt by both those<br/>that could evacuate, and those who didn't.")
('Sister Orze', "We'll need to do everything we can to get them taken<br/>care of.")
('Sister Orze', "Sister Philia is out. I do hope she's safe...")
('Sister Orze', 'I suppose all I can do is have faith in her.')
('Sister Orze', "She's always been very personable, so I'm sure she's<br/>out, helping local churches.")
('Sister Orze', "It's finally time for the ceremony... The Republic has<br/>gone through so much, and I don't mean just<br/>this year.")
('Sister Orze', "But I don't doubt the Goddess favors us. Soon, all the<br/>strife will be rewarded.")
('Sister Orze', "We must be grateful we are able to greet a new age.<br/>We must do so for those who can't.")
('Sister Orze', "I'd handled our staff scheduling so that Sister Belicia<br/>could be in her hometown to assist her people.")
('Sister Orze', "And to think that just meant she'd be another victim<br/>in the Creil Village tragedy...")
('Sister Orze', 'The least I can wish for is that she can rest easy,<br/>having supported her beloved hometown until the<br/>very end.')
('Sister Orze', 'I shall pray for the Goddess to bless Sister Belicia and<br/>her village.')
('Sister Orze', 'Come to think of it, Sister Philia made a confession<br/>to me this morning.')
('Sister Orze', "I'm not exactly sure what was bothering her. I can't<br/>imagine her faith is anything to confess about.")
('Sister Orze', "She spoke of reverence, but a word like that doesn't<br/>seem to invite sin to me...")
('Maxim', "I'll make sure they get to Old Town safely.")
('Maxim', "I can't thank you enough. I'll pay you back soon,<br/>I promise.")
('Maxim', 'So you better not die until I do! Paulette and Yumé<br/>would be heartbroken.')
('Paulette', "Thank you all so much for saving us. We're all<br/>right now.")
('Paulette', 'Please come back safe, okay?')
('Paulette', "I'll treat you to a nice cup of coffee once everything<br/>is over. So, do come back. I'll be waiting.")
('Yumé', 'Van, you promised!')
('Yumé', "I'll be patient, okay? I'll be waiting with Mommy and<br/>the old man!")
('Van', 'Yeah. Thanks, Yumé.')
('Agnès', 'You take care of yourself, too, Yumé. I look forward<br/>to having tea with you at Montmart next time.')
('Sister Philia', "Yes! I-I know there's a lot of important<br/>ceremonies today.")
('Sister Philia', 'But I REALLY need to get this done today!')
(15120, 'Fine. If you insist so much, then so be it.')
(15120, "You'll be back in time for the evening service.<br/>Understood?")
('Sister Philia', 'Y-Yes! Thank you so much!')
('Sister Philia', 'What a horrible tragedy... So many precious lives<br/>were taken.')
('Sister Philia', "There will be a memorial mass held in Edith<br/>Grand Cathedral. I'm making sure people are aware<br/>of it.")
('Sister Philia', 'We hope many will join us today in praying to the<br/>Goddess for those we lost. May their souls find peace.')
('Sister Philia', 'Sometimes I play messenger between some of the<br/>other chapels in the city.')
('Sister Philia', "Every time I visit one, I can't help feeling<br/>self-conscious about all my shortcomings and my<br/>own vices.")
('Sister Philia', '*sigh* I need to learn to be as devout as the<br/>other sisters...')
('Secretary Culleo', 'The professor and the students let me know<br/>communications were reestablished, albeit limited.')
('Secretary Culleo', 'We used that chance to contact the various embassies<br/>and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but as we feared,<br/>there was no response.')
('Secretary Culleo', 'Argh! I feel so useless here, but I need to continue my<br/>duties as ambassador.')
('Secretary Culleo', 'What a stroke of bad luck, for this to happen on the<br/>day of the festival. At least my family is safe.')
('Secretary Culleo', "I'd heard about all the anomalies happening in<br/>Erebonia and Crossbell...")
('Secretary Culleo', 'But I never thought something like that would<br/>happen to the Republic as well!')
('Secretary Culleo', 'I have to protect my dear Nadiya and Amia!')
('Secretary Culleo', "My family must've worried for me so much, but I<br/>hope I can have the chance to go back to them now.")
('Secretary Culleo', "I still need to get in contact with the other embassies<br/>and make sure everything is all right on their end.<br/>It's my duty as ambassador.")
('Secretary Culleo', 'But Nadiya and Amia are my priority!')
('Secretary Culleo', "It's funny how emotional you can get over events like<br/>these when you spend so much time out of<br/>the country.")
('Secretary Culleo', "Especially now that I get to spend time with<br/>my family. I hadn't been able to come home for a<br/>good two years when I left for the Empire!")
('Secretary Culleo', "When I think about how long I've been away,<br/>it makes me cherish this time with them<br/>even more.")
('Nadiya', "Culleo's really busy, but he still took time to spend<br/>with us.")
('Nadiya', 'I really have the greatest husband in all of Zemuria.')
('Nadiya', 'I constantly worried Culleo would fall out of love with<br/>me during those two years he spent in the Empire.')
('Nadiya', "Of course that never happened. I shouldn't doubt his<br/>love for me so much.")
('Nadiya', "This really had to happen when we'd finally gotten to<br/>spend some family time during the festival...")
('Nadiya', "What's worse, this might be the work of the mafia<br/>behind what happened in Creil.")
('Nadiya', "My daughter and I are scared, but we're hanging on<br/>since Culleo's here.")
('Nadiya', "I'm so happy that I'll get to spend this year's festival<br/>with Culleo.")
('Nadiya', "It's nice to spend the year's end with family.")
('Nadiya', "Considering everything that happened this year, I'm<br/>all the more eager to greet the new year with my<br/>whole family.")
('Nadiya', 'Culleo and I will be attending the memorial mass on<br/>the day of the festival, but we came by today to<br/>worship as well.')
('Nadiya', 'It hardly hurts to offer more prayers for peace for the<br/>victims, and peace for our future.')
('Nadiya', 'Besides, I like the cathedral. Honestly, I always have.')
('Nadiya', "It's peaceful here. I used to come by when I was still a<br/>novice artist to draw the cathedral. It's held a special<br/>place in my heart since.")
('Amia', "Daddy's been helping all the church people while<br/>we're here. That nice lady and the Aramis students<br/>are working hard, too.")
('Amia', "I was really scared at first, but we'll be okay now!<br/>Mommy and Daddy are with me, so I'm okay!")
('Amia', "I wanna help out so Daddy doesn't have to work so<br/>hard and get tired!")
('Amia', "What is that thing out there? It's scary. Really,<br/>really scary...")
('Amia', "Everyone's talking about what happened before, but<br/>what does it have to do with us?")
('Amia', "I trust Daddy, but I don't want him to get hurt...")
('Amia', 'I have to help him!')
('Amia', 'Daddy came back in time!')
('Amia', 'I thought he would be too tired to do anything<br/>with us...')
('Amia', "But now we'll be able to enjoy the whole<br/>festival together!")
('Amia', 'Mommy draws the cathedral a lot. Her drawings are<br/>really popular!')
('Amia', "But she said those weren't her favorite treasures, and<br/>that she has something 'more special.'")
('Amia', "I wonder which painting it could be? She wouldn't<br/>tell me! Said it was a secret.")
('Secretary Culleo', "I'm sorry I only made it back home yesterday. At least<br/>I made it to the memorial with you.")
('Secretary Culleo', "I know I've been really busy, but I made sure<br/>everything would be taken care of. You will have my<br/>undivided attention for the whole festival!")
('Nadiya', 'Aww, I really appreciate that, Culleo.')
('Nadiya', "You're in much higher spirits than I thought you<br/>would be.")
('Secretary Culleo', 'Yeah. I was worried the terrorist attack would<br/>cause a whole world of trouble in Crossbell.')
('Secretary Culleo', 'Turns out I had nothing to worry about!<br/>The Crossbell Police Department is just as capable as<br/>our own forces.')
('Secretary Culleo', 'Both businesses and citizens were helping out, too, so<br/>things went a lot more smoothly than I expected.')
('Amia', "Crossbell's gone through two, umm, incidents, right?")
('Secretary Culleo', 'That they have. And its people are all the stronger<br/>for it.')
('Secretary Culleo', 'Felt like a sorry excuse for an ambassador, relying on<br/>the locals so much, but I made sure to do everything<br/>in my power.')
('Amia', 'Wow! Crossbell sounds so cool!')
('Nadiya', 'I agree, darling. This talk has made me want to visit.<br/>But for today, we have a festival to look forward to.')
('Nadiya', 'Only those who have pride in their own nation can<br/>look towards their neighbors with respect.')
('Secretary Culleo', "That's right. I have my own concerns about the<br/>president's speech, but this is a rare chance for us to<br/>enjoy ourselves.")
('Secretary Culleo', "Let's celebrate the festival today, as family and<br/>citizens of the Republic both.")
('Nadiya', 'Goddess, thank you for blessing us.')
('Nadiya', 'Please grant eternal peace to the souls of those who<br/>have passed.')
('Amia', 'Miss Goddess Aidios, please watch over Daddy and<br/>Mommy and me.')
('Amia', "Mommy, where's Daddy?")
('Nadiya', "Oh, I forgot to mention. Culleo said he'd arrive a<br/>little late.")
('Nadiya', 'With the festival and now the attack on top of<br/>everything, things have been hectic over at the<br/>Crossbell Consulate.')
('Nadiya', "But don't worry. It sounds like everything will be<br/>settled before the festivities, and we'll get to spend the<br/>festival with Daddy.")
('Amia', 'Yay! I wanna spend the festival together with<br/>Mommy and Daddy!')
('Amia', "It's gonna be so much fun! I want Daddy to take<br/>me everywhere!")
('Nadiya', "Haha, sure, darling. We'll have fun today with Daddy<br/>to make up for all the times he couldn't be with us<br/>while he was working in Erebonia.")
('Odette', "Isn't Renne being a little scary? She looks pretty<br/>serious about this...")
('Odette', "Let's pull through this, Agnès! We can't let this OR<br/>exams win!")
('Agnès', "Yes! We'll get through this together, Odette!")
('Renne', "We were thankfully able to enlist the professor's aid.<br/>Our odds are looking up.")
('Renne', 'I wish I had more time to tinker with this<br/>Marduk terminal...')
('Renne', "...but I need to focus on the plan right now. Can't let<br/>anything go wrong, or we might not succeed.")
('Renne', 'Give it your best, Agnès. You better take good care of<br/>her, Van.')
('Agnès', "I promise I'll see this through, Renne!")
('Van', "Yeah, I got'cha. No slackin' in on this one. And I've<br/>still got shit to deal with from last month.")
('Renne', "Heehee, Aramis' student body is sharper than I gave<br/>them credit for. Quite a delightful tea party we have<br/>on our hands.")
('Renne', "I was hoping they'd hold a candle to Jenis after<br/>my transfer. Or to Thors, considering all I've heard<br/>from Tita.")
('Renne', "I'm expecting a lot from you, Agnès.<br/>Don't disappoint me, all right?")
('Agnès', "O-Of course!<br/>(Well, that's comforting, but also laying the pressure<br/>on a little thick...)")
('Julian', "I thankfully made it to the Auber District. I'll lend<br/>everyone at the school a hand!")
('Julian', 'Everyone in Aramis is working real hard...')
('Julian', "I can't be slacking off! I need to get myself in<br/>gear, too!")
('Julian', 'Not a boring day with Lyle around.')
('Julian', "This is my first Revolution Festival, so I'm hoping to<br/>get to really see the sights.")
('Julian', 'Gotta make sure to make a lot of memories to share<br/>with my friends back in the Empire.')
('Lyle', "Man... I should've known, but I stopped by my place<br/>on my way here, and my fam's all frozen!")
('Lyle', "No way I can leave them like that! I mean, they didn't<br/>get attacked or anything...")
('Lyle', "Man, this thing's real scary! At least I got Julian with<br/>me, so we'll figure out what to do.")
('Lyle', 'You and your team, too, Agnès! Hang in there!')
('Agnès', 'Of course! Take care, Lyle!')
('Lyle', "Argh! Julian's such a chick magnet, it's unreal.<br/>How does he do that?")
('Lyle', "I know! I'm gonna mooch off of—I-I mean!<br/>I'm gonna show him around the festival and learn all<br/>his secret techniques.")
('Julian', 'You sure you wanna come with me to look<br/>for people?')
('Julian', "I'm honestly not super thrilled about leaving<br/>campus grounds...")
('Lyle', "Heh, don't worry! These long and attractive legs are<br/>just as good for hoofing it!")
('Lyle', 'And what kinda friend would I be if I just<br/>abandoned you?')
('Julian', 'Lyle... Thanks. I really appreciate it.')
('Julian', "I'll take care of the monsters. You focus on finding<br/>and rescuing people!")
('Lyle', 'No prob! All that practice hitting on girls has<br/>polished my hottie radar to a mirror sheen!')
('Julian', 'Your...hottie radar?')
('James', "Yeah, I knew that she wasn't dead.")
('James', "She's immediately back in gear, though. Helping out<br/>refugees the moment she returns. It's very like her.")
('James', "...I should step up to the plate, too. I'd feel<br/>awful otherwise. I'll at least help with security.")
('James', 'So, where should I keep an eye out?')
('James', 'What the hell is going on?! I tried booking it as fast<br/>as I could...')
('James', "Is Sasha...? No, there's no way she'd bite the dust<br/>that easily, right?")
('James', 'No, no! Focus, damn it! I need to help the first<br/>years escape.')
('Sasha', "Our first priority is taking care of evacuees! We've got<br/>food and water, so distribute it accordingly.")
('Sasha', "We'll set up a watch, too. If you see something<br/>suspicious, report it immediately.")
('Sasha', "Aramis has taught us a lot about being independent<br/>and fending for ourselves. It's time we put those<br/>lessons to use!")
(15130, 'Yes, Captain Sasha!')
('Agnès', "(Sasha is doing an amazing job. I've got to live up to<br/>her example!)")
('Sasha', 'Finally made it back. Had to take a different route<br/>after leaving the first years in Vantail, so that took<br/>a while.')
('Sasha', "I made it back with nothing but an orbal gun for<br/>self defense. That's freakin' nuts!")
('Sasha', 'But it looks like James managed to get everyone out<br/>just fine.')
('Sasha', 'I got to talk with Renne, too. It was just a bit, but<br/>with that settled, we can focus on the task at hand!')
('Sasha', "All right, Student Council! Let's get back in gear!")
('Sasha', "There's a lot of club events coming up, but I think<br/>I'll prioritize getting the basketball club ready for this<br/>winter's nationals.")
('Sasha', "I'm their captain, after all. It's on me to lead them<br/>to victory!")
('Sasha', "Okay! We've got finals after the festival, and we've<br/>gotta start planning the school festival after that, too.")
('Sasha', 'Both the Student Council and my clubs will keep me<br/>very busy.')
('Odette', "Aww, I'd finally forgotten all about exams! Why did<br/>you have to remind me?")
('Agnès', 'Haha... Things will be really hectic for you, huh?')
('Agnès', "Make sure you don't miss the Revolution Festival!<br/>We can take great inspiration from it for our own<br/>school festival.")
('Renne', 'An excellent idea.')
('Renne', "I've little experience planning events like these, but<br/>I'll endeavor to make sure this tea party's<br/>most exquisite.")
('Renne', "I was hoping you'd hold a candle to Jenis after<br/>my transfer. Or to Thors, considering all I've heard<br/>from Tita.")
('Renne', 'Agnès, Odette, Sasha? I have high hopes for you.')
('Odette', "Oooh, I don't like that! This is gonna be weird, I can<br/>feel it!")
('Sasha', "I'm gonna be busy anyway, but seeing Renne get so<br/>into this is a little scary.")
('Sasha', "Well, we don't have time to dawdle! Onwards,<br/>you guys! To the new year!")
('Odette', 'Of course!')
('Mr. Powell', "Ah. It's you. As I understand it, you and your group<br/>have done a lot for us.")
('Mr. Powell', "I won't pry, don't worry. Best of luck in your<br/>endeavors, and may we all pull through this.")
('Mr. Powell', 'The academy is taking in as many refugees as we<br/>can find. We have enough food and water to last for a<br/>while, at least.')
('Mr. Powell', "You don't have to worry about us. You've something<br/>to take care of, so go.")
('Mr. Powell', 'Haha, the students around here are all in high spirits.')
('Mr. Powell', "This year's been a challenging one. I only hope it<br/>helps to spur them on to keep growing.")
('Mr. Powell', 'At least today should serve to give them some respite.<br/>They should enjoy themselves.')
('Mr. Powell', 'Oh. Hello, Agnès. You busy with that part time job<br/>you mentioned?')
('Agnès', "Hello, Mr. Powell. Yes, that's right.")
('Feri', "You're Agnès' teacher? You look very smart!")
('Agnès', 'Mr. Powell teaches history and is in charge of the<br/>second year students.')
('Mr. Powell', "I don't know how smart I really am, but I'll be glad to<br/>answer any questions you might have.")
('Mr. Powell', 'If I know the answer to them, at least.')
('Mr. Powell', "Oh. You're...")
('Mr. Powell', '...Arkride? Van Arkride?')
('Aaron', 'Huh?')
('Risette', "If you're familiar with Van...")
('Quatre', 'Wait, if you know Van...')
('Judith', 'If he knows you, then...')
('Van', "Man... Figured you would've forgotten all about<br/>me already.")
('Van', "Nice seein' you, Mr. Powell.")
('Mr. Powell', "Forgotten? Impossible. You don't just forget students<br/>as special as you, Van.")
('Mr. Powell', "It's been seven long years. I am glad that, despite<br/>everything, you seem to be doing well.")
('Van', "I'm doin' fine, thanks. Though I guess I made shit<br/>real rowdy around here, huh. Sorry 'bout that.")
('Mr. Powell', "Not at all. I do wish I'd been able to do more for you,<br/>as your teacher.")
('Mr. Powell', "But I guess it's too late for such regrets by now,<br/>isn't it?")
('Mr. Powell', "If there's anything I can do for you now, I hope you<br/>know you just have to ask.")
('Van', "'Preciate it, but I really am fine. Thanks for the<br/>thought, though.")
('Agnès', "(It hadn't even occurred to me that Van might have<br/>been one of Mr. Powell's students.)")
('Feri', "(So, Van studied at Aramis? That's new!)")
('Aaron', "(He did sorta give me that feel. He's just full of<br/>surprises, eh?)")
('Risette', '(Indeed. He will hopefully be open to discussing it<br/>with us sometime in the future.)')
('Quatre', "(Yeah... I'd be curious to learn more myself.)")
('Judith', '(Not a big deal, but it does kinda bother me.)')
('Bergard', '(Hmm...)')
('Mr. Powell', 'So Agnès is working for you, then?')
('Mr. Powell', "What a small and wonderful world we live in. But I'll<br/>leave you to it.")
('Mr. Powell', "I'm relieved you seem well. I look forward to you<br/>visiting, if you ever feel like it.")
('Van', 'Sure. Take care of yourself, Mr. Powell. Keep an eye<br/>on Agnès, too.')
('Feri', "(Van's acting just like Abi!)")
('Agnès', "(Th-That's embarrassing...)")
(15132, 'Thank you for your time today!')
('Ms. Sonia', 'Of course! Good work today, everyone.')
('Ms. Sonia', "I know the Revolution Festival is almost here, but<br/>don't get too excited. Be safe on your way home.")
(15133, 'You look real cheery today, Ms. Sonia.<br/>Something good happen?')
(15132, 'I think Ms. Sonia is more pumped for the festival<br/>than we are.')
('Ms. Sonia', 'Oh, goodness! Not at all, I assure you!')
('Ms. Sonia', "Anyway, be safe, everyone! Don't wanna get hurt and<br/>waste all your hard work for the winter tournament!")
('Ms. Sonia', "(A blind date on the exact same day as the festival?<br/>That's impeccable timing.)")
('Ms. Sonia', "(Oh, how romantic! I guess the Goddess hasn't given<br/>up on me yet after all!)")
('Van', "I've seen you before. You're from the bar in the<br/>Blacklight District.")
('Gabriella', 'I got mixed up in this mess, so I had to help people<br/>evacuate to the school.')
('Gabriella', "Don't you worry, though. I fought off all the devils on<br/>campus grounds.")
('Aaron', 'You used to be a jaeger, yeah? Good to have someone<br/>to kick some ass around here.')
('Agnès', 'Yes, absolutely. Please, keep everyone safe!')
('Gabriella', "Sure, I'll keep an eye on the kids. For Yota's sake, no<br/>one's getting past me!")
('Gabriella', "You guys got something planned, right? Don't worry<br/>about us. I'll keep 'em safe, so get going!")
('Gabriella', "No one, devil or otherwise, is getting past me.<br/>I'll grind them all to a fine paste. For Yota!")
('Gabriella', '(Yota, calm down a bit!)')
('Gabriella', "Damn it... I should've done something sooner.")
('Gabriella', "I can't believe I didn't realize how Yota felt. I feel<br/>so useless...")
('Gabriella', 'Well, we should at least enjoy ourselves today.')
('Yota', "Heehee, we're giving out water!")
('Yota', "And we're giving out hugs, too! That'll make<br/>everyone feel better!")
('Gabriella', "(Oh... My darling Yota. Even at a time like this,<br/>you're such a sweetheart!)")
('Risette', '(I gather things are under control here.)')
('Quatre', "(Agreed. Let's move on!)")
('Yota', "Wooow! There's so many shops! And so<br/>many people!")
('Yota', 'Mommy, look! It looks so fun!')
('Cremona', "Aramis students are so capable. I'm glad my young<br/>lady will someday come to this school, too.")
('Cremona', 'My lady and I are thankfully safe. We owe a<br/>lot to everyone here in Aramis.')
('Cremona', "Still, Chief Rumsfeld worries me... I wish I could let<br/>him know we're safe.")
('Cremona', "I worried whether it'd be wise for me to be away,<br/>considering how busy things are.")
('Cremona', "But Chief Rumsfeld gave me the okay, so I'm<br/>accompanying the young lady.")
('Cremona', 'I hope the young lady is able to enjoy today, and<br/>genuinely appreciate what the chief has done for her.')
('Cremona', "My lady has been enjoying herself quite a lot.<br/>I'm glad I was able to accompany her.")
('Cremona', "She's been talking more with her father, so she's been<br/>in a good mood.")
('Berzelia', "Th-That's simply not true, Cremona! I... I 'm just<br/>taking advantage of the opportunity!")
('Berzelia', "Father missed the festival, or have you forgotten?<br/>I certainly haven't!")
('Cremona', "That may be so, but I'm overjoyed nonetheless to see<br/>you so openly enjoy yourself.")
('Cremona', "Now, where shall we head after this? Perhaps to<br/>Riverside's concert hall?")
('Berzelia', "Hmm... The Blue Score is hosting an idol concert<br/>today, so I'm not terribly interested.")
('Berzelia', "Why don't we tour Aramis instead? I'm to enroll<br/>there in a few years, after all.")
('Cremona', 'Oh, goodness. To think my lady would make a<br/>choice like that based on her future...')
('Cremona', 'You have matured so much this past year.')
('Berzelia', 'Cremona, stop it! This is embarrassing! I-I just felt<br/>we should take a look for good measure.')
('Berzelia', "For one, they'll be hosting their own festival in the<br/>spring, and I would very much like to go.")
('Berzelia', 'Is the old man... Is Father safe? He was on his way to<br/>the capital. What if something happened to him?')
('Berzelia', "The situation's a mess, b-but you're not a child<br/>anymore, Berzelia. Get a hold of yourself.")
('Berzelia', "A-Anyway... I need to let the old man know that I'm<br/>safe, if I can. I wouldn't want him to worry.")
('Berzelia', "Now that Father and I have gotten to talk, I'm even<br/>more determined to not let any of this<br/>ruin everything!")
('Berzelia', "Father may not be here, but I'm grateful for<br/>him nonetheless. And for you, Cremona.")
('Berzelia', "I'll just have to enjoy myself on the double, for his<br/>sake, too!")
('Agnès', "Shino! I didn't think you'd be here!")
('Shino', 'Hello there. I evacuated into the school with<br/>everyone else.')
('Shino', "I'm guessing you managed to get things<br/>under control? Thank you so much.")
('Shino', 'As for myself, I plan to help out in whatever way I can.')
('Van', "So that's why you're handin' out drinks? Good<br/>work, thanks.")
('Van', 'Keep an eye on the people here, yeah?')
('Shino', "Of course. I'll do what I can.")
('Shino', "The rest of you take care of yourselves. I'll be<br/>awaiting your return.")
('Feri', "For sure! We'll get this taken care of. Count on it!")
('Shino', "I'm serving drinks to the evacuees.")
('Shino', "It's honestly pure chaos. Some people aren't coping<br/>well with the anxiety.")
('Shino', "I'm doing what I can to help everyone here.")
('Shino', "The rest of you take care of yourselves. I'll be<br/>awaiting your return.")
('Shino', "Welcome. It's a lovely day, isn't it? Perfect for the<br/>Revolution Festival.")
('Shino', "I'm grateful that we're still standing here today—in<br/>spite of everything that's happened.")
('Shino', 'No doubt you and your team have been working hard<br/>to maintain this peace.')
('Shino', 'Allow me to thank you for your efforts. Please, do<br/>enjoy the festival.')
('Van', 'Heya, Shino.')
('Agnès', 'Funny to see you in front of Aramis.')
('Shino', 'Oh, right. I was looking for a good spot and I<br/>suppose I just ended up here.')
('Shino', 'The location is nice and quiet, and the view is<br/>just lovely.')
('Shino', 'And not only that, but my food is actually quite<br/>popular with the students.')
('Feri', "Well, of course you'd want a snack after classes.<br/>You get hungry after so long!")
('Aaron', "No, I think you just don't eat enough, small fry.")
('Agnès', 'I imagine the sports club members are<br/>especially appreciative.')
('Shino', 'The location is nice and quiet, and the view is<br/>just lovely.')
('Shino', "I've been looking for a good spot to set up during the<br/>Revolution Festival, and this might just be it.")
('Downey', "The huge milkies—I-I mean! That professor took off<br/>in my car! And she's a way better driver than I am!")
('Downey', "I couldn't turn her down since she said they needed it<br/>for something important, but this is just driving<br/>me nuts!")
('Downey', '...Maybe I could go take a peek?')
('Hyades', "Some Aramis students asked me to bring 'em here, so<br/>here I am!")
('Hyades', "Ain't lettin' Junifer and Graham steal all the glory!")
('Downey', 'Your driving skills are pretty epic, Hyades! You did a<br/>nice job dodging those monsters.')
('Downey', 'B-But my car! That professor with the, like, massive<br/>knockers took my car!')
('Downey', "And she's a way better driver than me! How is<br/>that fair?! Well, she did say she needed it to transport<br/>some equipment...")
('Quatre', 'Are you referring to Essy? Come to think of it, she<br/>can be pretty wild behind the wheel...')
('Van', "Huh. Seriously? Wouldn't have guessed.")
('Hyades', "Honestly, Downey. Are you still mad about it?<br/>That's kinda sad...")
('Hyades', 'We gotta do whatever we can.')
('Hyades', "Whether it's transporting things or people, or driving<br/>around to look for people who haven't evacuated yet.")
('Hyades', "Ain't lettin' Junifer and Graham steal all the glory!")
('Roman', "I managed to get in touch with Curtis. Oh,<br/>thank Aidios. That's a weight off my shoulders.")
('Roman', "But I know we still don't really know how to fix this.")
('Roman', "I'm not sure if there's a lot that I can do, but still...")
('Roman', 'This could be the key to our lives going back<br/>to normal! Please, do everything you can!')
('Roman', "It could be dangerous to move around now, so we'll<br/>have to settle down and do what we can from here.")
('Roman', "We're all praying for your plan's success. But please,<br/>stay safe!")
('Roman', "I'm so relieved, knowing how things are going over<br/>for Old Town, and for Curtis, too.")
('Roman', 'I should take the time to talk to him some more, if I<br/>go back there.')
('Roman', 'Yes! Just thinking about that makes me wanna<br/>keep going!')
('Roman', "I'm relieved to hear about Old Town. I'm still worried<br/>about Curtis, though...")
('Roman', 'I should take the time to talk to him some more, if I<br/>go back there.')
('Roman', "I... I just have to trust that I'll get that chance.")
('Zora', "I'm so relieved to have heard Curtis' voice!")
('Zora', "Also, I must compliment Aramis' students. They're so<br/>capable, even in a situation like this.")
('Zora', "Everyone's bustling about, doing what they can.<br/>This school is truly amazing.")
('Zora', "Once things are peaceful again, I'm going to tell<br/>Curtis all about this!")
('Zora', 'I was so sure that my boy hated us now...')
('Zora', 'I want to go home! Go home and hug him tight and<br/>never let go!')
('Zora', "It's enough for us as long as Curtis is safe.")
('Zora', "Ah, I need to get back immediately! I hope he's<br/>doing okay!")
('Zora', "Spriggan, please! You're all we have now!")
('Roman', 'I was attending mass with my wife, when all of<br/>this happened... What in the world is going on?')
('Roman', "We left Curtis back at home in Old Town. I do hope<br/>he's safe...")
('Zora', 'Oh, Goddess! Please protect our boy!')
('Feri', "(They live on Old Town's outskirts, right?)")
('Feri', "Umm, don't worry! Things have calmed down in<br/>Old Town!")
('Zora', 'R-Really?!')
('Roman', 'Have you gone to Old Town yourselves?!')
('Van', 'Yeah. Place is a whole lot quieter than here, actually.')
('Van', "I talked with your son. Ain't got a scratch on him.")
('Van', "He also asked me to tell you somethin'.")
('System', "Van relayed Curtis' message to Roman and Zora.")
('Zora', 'Oh, dear! Our son said something like that?')
('Zora', 'He has so much trouble saying what he really feels.<br/>Such a silly boy...')
('Roman', "Haha... Still, I'm so relieved to hear he's safe, and he<br/>was even worried about us!")
('Roman', 'Well, hearing that takes a load off my shoulders!')
('Roman', "Thank you so much for letting us know! I know we're<br/>still in dire straits.")
('Zora', 'I feel much calmer now.')
('Zora', "Umm, here. I'd like you to have these.")
('System', 'Obtained 4 <br/>.')
('Zora', "It really isn't much, but I hope you'll accept it!")
('Agnès', "Thank you very much. We'll make good use of these!")
('Van', "Everyone outside's gonna be okay, so please stay put.")
('Elaine', "You've not changed in the slightest. Even when we<br/>were kids you were like this. Do you have any idea<br/>how much I—")
('Van', "Look... I'm sorry, Elaine, but I don't think we've got<br/>time for this. We've gotta get a move on.")
('Elaine', "Oh, no you don't! Get back here, Van! I'm not done<br/>talking to you!")
('Van', "(You haven't changed either. You need to learn to<br/>take it easy a little...)")
('Fie', "I met up with Rixia on the way. I guess we're going to<br/>the same place.")
('Fie', "I'll leave Elaine to you. I'm sure you and the others<br/>will make it there.")
('Quatre', "The East's desertification is always a pretty heavy<br/>discussion topic, but everyone looks like they're<br/>enjoying themselves.")
('Quatre', "They're all responsible for being the foundation of<br/>this day and age, so it would stand to reason that<br/>they'd get along quite well.")
('Quatre', "Ah, I'm also participating in the discussion, but if you<br/>need anything, please don't hesitate to ask.")
('FIO', "Just in case, Bodyguard Mode is on today. We're on<br/>the lookout for anyone suspicious.")
('FIO', 'Leave guarding the professor to FIO and XEROS!')
('XEROS', 'RUFF! RUFF!')
('Van', 'Well, they look cheery.')
('Van', "Must be happy about gettin' to see the professor for<br/>the first time in a while.")
('Agnès', 'Oh, hello, Albert! So, about Curtis...')
('System', 'Agnès explained the situation regarding Curtis.')
('Albert', "Yeah? That's good to know.")
('Albert', "I guess now we just have to keep an eye on him.<br/>I'll bear that in mind.")
('Albert', 'Good job. I guess even you guys can do a good job<br/>every now and then.')
('Albert', "If he did buy some kind of tablet, it's quite likely he<br/>got it from that man.")
('Albert', "He's been stressed out by both family and the<br/>upcoming exams. There's a lot weighing on him.")
('Albert', 'I hope you can help him.')
('Agnès', 'Yes, of course!')
('Albert', "Ahem. I'm afraid the Student Council will be busy<br/>discussing other matters at length, so we won't have<br/>time for much else.")
('Van', 'Oh, yeah? Is that right?')
('Aaron', "Can't bear to break a promise to a pretty lady,<br/>eh, casanova?")
('Albert', "Stop teasing me! I-I didn't mean it like that!")
('Agnès', '(What are they talking about?)')
('Albert', "A-Anyway, we'll be busy during the festival.")
('Albert', "Besides, it's an important day for the Republic.<br/>I don't think it's appropriate to spend it<br/>so irreverently.")
('Van', "(I ain't buying that for a sec, but I guess I'll lay off.)")
('Albert', "Basically, you tried your luck with a bunch of girls<br/>and had zero luck. So now you're in desperate need<br/>for someone to spend the festival with?")
('Albert', 'This is ridiculous. Unsurprising, but ridiculous all<br/>the same. What are you even planning?')
('Lyle', "C'mon, man! A sausage party is better than being<br/>all alone!")
('Lyle', "Also, y'know, extra manpower means extra sex<br/>appeal, yeah? The ladies will be flocking to us during<br/>the festival!")
('Albert', 'Unbelievable... Well, unfortunately for you, I made<br/>arrangements with the Student Council. I suspect<br/>Julian will also be busy?')
('Julian', "No, actually. I don't have any plans.")
('Julian', 'I was hoping to have someone show me around the<br/>festival, in fact. Maybe you would be willing to?')
('Lyle', 'For real?! You, who could have your pick from all the<br/>hot babes at school, is choosing to go with me?!')
('Lyle', "Thanks, man! Julian, I freakin' love you!")
('Albert', 'You are utterly incomprehensible.')
('Dominion Celis', "Man, I thought WE were supposed to be the experts<br/>on dealin' with devils and shit. Crazy that orbal tech<br/>can do that for you now.")
('Dominion Celis', "Marduk's real shady, but eh. Can't complain.")
('Dominion Celis', 'I still got my own shit to do as a Dominion.')
('Dominion Celis', "Man, I sure have been slackin' a lot. Leon's been<br/>pullin' my weight around, too.")
('Dominion Celis', "Stop wasting your time here, what the hell! I didn't<br/>go through all that trouble to look that up for you just<br/>so you can bitch out!")
('Dominion Celis', "Get your ass in gear and fight them, already!<br/>Aren't you supposed to save that silver-haired kid?!")
('Dominion Celis', "I'll kick your ass if you miss this chance! Come<br/>on, fight!")
('Dominion Celis', "I'll, uh, catch up with you guys later. I'm not tired,<br/>just catching my breath!")
('Dominion Celis', "You're being real freakin' annoying! Buzz off, or I'm<br/>gonna MAKE you buzz off!")
('Dominion Celis', "Man, I suck ass at clairvoyance. Leon's supposed to<br/>be the good one at it.")
('Van', "Sorry 'bout that.")
('Van', "This place looks like it's gonna be real annoying.")
('Van', "Sorry 'bout that. I know it's a pain, but we're<br/>doing this for Quatre.")
('Dominion Celis', "Don't get me wrong. I still don't trust that you don't<br/>got anything to do with this shit.")
('Dominion Celis', 'But you look pretty damn desperate to save both the<br/>city and that friend of yours.')
('Dominion Celis', "You got a whole lot to prove, spriggan. You're gonna<br/>be in some deep shit if you back down from this one.")
('Van', "Don't worry. Wasn't plannin' to.")
('Agnès', '(Van...?)')
('Dominion Celis', "This demon sphere's a real pain in the ass.")
('Dominion Celis', "How the hell is this fair?! I can't figure out the last<br/>part of this shitty ass game!")
('Van', "Figures. I thought somethin' was off.")
('Dominion Celis', 'You and Miss Yin here do what you can in<br/>the meantime.')
('Dominion Celis', "If I figure this shit out, I'll let you know telepathically.")
('Dominion Celis', "Hey, Rixia. You mind givin' us a hand with those<br/>talismans of yours?")
('Rixia', 'Of course.')
('Feri', '(Clairvoyance AND telepathy?!)')
('Aaron', "(Something tells me this chick shouldn't be dumping<br/>all these trade secrets on us.)")
('Bergard', '(It can be a quality, depending on how you look at it.)')
('Dominion Celis', "This demon sphere's a real pain in the ass.")
('Dominion Celis', 'You and Miss Yin here do what you can in<br/>the meantime.')
('Dominion Celis', "If I figure this shit out, I'll let you know telepathically.")
('Dominion Celis', "Aren't you full of surprises.")
('Dominion Celis', 'By the way, Leon should be patrolling around the<br/>Blacklight District.')
('Dominion Celis', 'All these shady characters are taking advantage of the<br/>festival to gather.')
('Dominion Celis', "Well, I can't say more than that. Confidential, and<br/>only for Master's ears.")
('Dominion Celis', "Leon's gonna be spending the next few days in<br/>Edith's outskirts.")
('Dominion Celis', "Best wishes to you guys or whatever. I'll give ya a<br/>hand if those bad predictions of mine turn out to<br/>be true.")
('Van', 'How generous of you.<br/>(Bad predictions, huh...)')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "Even if our spriggan here won't appreciate our well<br/>wishes, I do sincerely hope you all will be safe<br/>out there.")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'This might be the calm right before the storm,<br/>after all.')
('Agnès', 'Ah...')
('Bergard', '...Leon.')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "Pardon me if I've overstepped, but I imagine you're of<br/>the same mind, right?")
('Van', 'I mean, never hurts to be careful.')
('Van', "(No way he didn't know with how he's acting.)")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "Well, I can't imagine you'll be in much danger if you<br/>have our teacher with you.")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "I'll pray for your safety. Even yours, Arkride.")
('Van', "Don't really need it, but thanks for worrying.")
('Rixia', 'The assault plan will hopefully go well.')
('Rixia', "This is the moment of truth. Whatever comes, there's<br/>no backing down now. Please stay safe, everyone.")
('Rixia', 'Oh. Come to think of it, Ilya and Sully said they<br/>wanted some pictures of the capital...')
('Rixia', "I'd love it if they could also see the place where I was<br/>born and raised. Him, too.")
('Rixia', "Hmm... Maybe I'll take care of that and then go for a<br/>nice walk.")
('Judith', "Oooh, 'him'? Come on, spill! Is it that boyfriend of<br/>yours I keep hearing about? You can't hide him<br/>forever, you know!")
('Rixia', "C-Come on, Judith! It's not like that...")
('Fie', 'This is the first incident this big since the<br/>Retributive Tower, I think.')
('Rixia', 'Probably...')
('Rixia', "But we don't have Lloyd—I mean, we don't have the<br/>Special Support Section or Class VII for backup<br/>this time. Or any other backup, for that matter.")
('Rixia', "But if it's to protect the place where I was born—my<br/>second home—I will brandish my blade<br/>without hesitation.")
('Fie', "Yep. And I'm a Republic bracer at the moment.")
('Fie', "I'll back you up so we can ensure the safety of the<br/>citizens and the city.")
('Van', 'You two are hitting it off nicely.')
('Van', "Didn't you two team up durin' the Crossbell<br/>incident anyway?")
('Fie', 'We did. To be fair, we already knew each other<br/>before that, though.')
('Rixia', "Yeah. Though come to think of it, I don't think we'd<br/>been together in the Republic before.")
('Rixia', "Though I guess this isn't the time to reminisce.")
('Fie', "I won't be joining the assault. Have my own stuff to<br/>do, and I need to make sure civilians are safe.")

('Bergard', 'I am simply giving them a little moral support—<br/>nothing more.')
('Van', "*sigh* Looks like you've already caught each other up<br/>on what's going on.")
('Van', "Oh, by the way. You haven't seen Quatre, have you?")
('Van', 'I believe Elaine was in this area, too.')
('Agnès', 'N-Now that you mention it...')
('Risette', "She was with you in the pâtisserie, wasn't she?")
('Risette', 'I hear that she was with you in the pâtisserie before<br/>the crisis?')
('Dominion Celis', 'Yeah. All this stuff went down just after we<br/>finished paying.')
('Dominion Celis', 'But she said she was leaving this district to us and<br/>ran off.')
('Dominion Celis', "Nothin' catches Beauty's Blade off guard.<br/>Dunno where she went, though.")
('Van', 'Sounds about right...')
('Agnès', 'I wonder where she could have gone?')
('Rixia', 'I wish we knew where Quatre was, too.')
('Rixia', "We split up and searched for him after our enemy's<br/>last message, but he was nowhere to be found.")
('Feri', "R-Really? That's worrying...")
('Aaron', "Ehh, he's got his drones with him, so I'm sure<br/>he's fine.")
('FIO', 'Van and friends sighted.')
('Agnès', 'FIO!')
('Dominion Celis', "It's one of his little things!")
('Rixia', "I-It doesn't seem to be floating very steadily, though...")
('Van', 'What happened to your master, FIO? Is XEROS<br/>with you?')
('FIO', 'Negative. The location of XEROS is unknown.')
('FIO', 'All signs suggest that Quatre was absorbed into the<br/>space within that demon sphere.')
('Aaron', 'Shit...!')
('Judith', 'So he got captured like Agnès and I did!')
('Bergard', 'We were too late...')
('Van', "Wha—?! There's so many of them!")
('Rixia', "It's too dangerous to stay here! We need to go!")
('Dominion Celis', "The cathedral's not far! C'mon!")
('System', 'They hurried inside the cathedral where they would<br/>be safe.')
('System', 'Once inside, they shared what they each knew on the<br/>crisis that was occurring.')
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Damn it all... So that's where Quatre is.")
('Professor Hamilton', '...')
('Professor Hamilton', 'Van, you said that those absorbed by a demon sphere<br/>are not in any immediate danger, correct?')
('Van', "That's right. We can't make any guarantees, but they<br/>came out unharmed in every case so far.")
('Agnès', "That's right. So I'm sure Quatre is just fine, too!")
('Judith', 'Yeah. Maxim and I barely had a scratch on us.')
('Feri', "Though I wish we knew what the spheres were<br/>'capturing' people for...")
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', 'That is not hard to discern. They are simply<br/>absorbing those who bear a close connection.')
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', "And by that, I do not mean close to Almata, but<br/>rather the 'key' at the center of this predicament.")
('Aaron', 'Wait. Say what?')
('Van', 'Just how much do you know about all of this?')
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', 'Age begets wisdom, and wisdom allows one to see<br/>that which the young cannot.')
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', 'I imagine the professor and the Roaring Lion are of<br/>the same mind.')
('Professor Hamilton', '...')
('Bergard', 'I will refrain from comment.')
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "You're making me feel bad for not having a clue<br/>what's going on, y'know.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "But either way, all this can wait. Our first priority's<br/>gotta be getting Quatre outta that sphere and<br/>smashing it up, no?")
('Van', "You're not wrong—especially since we're against the<br/>clock now.")
('Van', "Let's go get him. C'mon, FIO.")
('FIO', 'Understood.')
('Feri', "Which means we'll have to get rid of that barrier!")
('Risette', 'Indeed. To do that, we will need to begin by<br/>surveying the surrounding area once more.')
('Professor Hamilton', 'Thank you all. We are counting on you.')
('Agnès', "You need not thank us. He's our friend, and we care<br/>about him, too.")
('Rixia', 'I will accompany you. This would not have happened<br/>if we had simply worked together in the first place.')
('Judith', "*sigh* This isn't your fault at all. You really do take<br/>things too personally...")
('Van', "Still, I ain't gonna say no to the help.")
('Rixia', 'The same to all of you.')
('Dominion Celis', "I'd offer to come with you myself, but it looks like<br/>you've got more than enough help already.")
('Dominion Celis', "So I'm gonna use a little trick of mine to see if I can't<br/>aid you from here.")
('Aaron', 'Oh?')
('Bergard', 'I believe we can depend on her here. She may not<br/>seem the part, but she is one of the finest knights in<br/>the church.')
('Dominion Celis', 'Well, sorry for not seeming the part!')
('Dominion Celis', 'If I use my Stigma even I can handle clairvoyance,<br/>even if I suck at it otherwise—oops.')
('Rixia', 'Ahaha...')
('Van', "We'll pretend we didn't hear that. We're countin'<br/>on you.")
('Dominion Celis', 'Y-You do that! Now get going!')
('System', 'FIO and Rixia are now temporarily<br/>accompanying you.')
('System', "Press  to use FIO's search functionality.")
('System', 'Use it to investigate all of the  points in the area.')
('XEROS', 'GRR... RUFF!')
('FIO', 'Three biological reactions detected!<br/>Prediction: Quatre, Yumé, and Paulette!')
('Feri', "It's not just Quatre?!")
('Judith', "We weren't expecting to find Yumé and Paulette<br/>here, too!")
('Aaron', 'We were gonna bust this thing up anyway. Now we<br/>can get three people for one!')
('Van', 'Here it comes!')
('Agnès', 'Ugh!')
('Rixia', 'Such negative energy!')
('Bergard', 'This will not be an easy battle!')
('Dominion Celis', "*pant* *pant* Hey, I'm here now!")
('Bergard', "Celis! Your timing couldn't have been better!")
('Van', "Thanks for comin'! Can you give us a hand?")
('Dominion Celis', 'Damn right, I can!')
('Dominion Celis', 'Searing seal of mine, shining from the abyss...')
('Dominion Celis', 'Overflow from within me and become a great stream<br/>to quell this evil!')
('Rixia', "Now's our chance, everyone!")
('Feri', 'Right!')
('Risette', 'Understood!')
('Dominion Celis', "No, you don't! You're up against me!")
('Dominion Celis', 'Heh. They did it, huh?')
('Yumé', 'Whoaaa...')
('Agnès', "We're back outside!")
('Quatre', 'So those spheres can deploy their own phase spaces...<br/>It defies all imagination...')
('Quatre', 'Still, I expected you to be here a little sooner—<br/>though I did have faith you would come for me.')
('Aaron', "We don't take customer complaints, kiddo.")
('Feri', "But I'm happy you believed in us!")
('Van', "Sounds like you were doin' your part while we were<br/>away, too. Good work.")
('Van', "Shame you ended up gettin' caught, but at least you<br/>left FIO to pick up where you left off.")
('Quatre', 'S-Stop touching me, already!')
('Paulette', "Heehee. I'm glad everything worked out in the<br/>end, Quatre.")
('Yumé', 'Van! Van! I want attention!')
('Van', 'All right, all right. You did real good, too, Yumes.')
('Agnès', 'Thank you for your help, Rixia. And you, Celis.')
('Judith', 'The fact that we needed it stings a little, but we<br/>appreciate it all the same.')
('Rixia', 'Oh, not at all.')
('Dominion Celis', 'Dealing with devils is part of my job<br/>description anyway.')
('Chief Engineer Giscard', 'Well, now! You actually pulled it off!')
('Professor Hamilton', "Quatre... Thank goodness you're safe.")
('Quatre', 'Professor! Supervisor!')
('Aaron', 'What, did you tag along to check on us, too, Gien?')
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', 'I feared you would have need of these weary bones.<br/>Not so, fortunately.')
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', "Regardless, Pandemonium's influence still<br/>reigns here. We should hurry back to the cathedral.")
('System', 'They hurried back to the cathedral together, where<br/>the exhausted Yumé and Paulette were able to<br/>enjoy some warm soup and relax.')
('System', 'Afterwards, Elder Gien and Professor Hamilton told<br/>them of a past crisis that was disturbingly similar to<br/>their current predicament.')
('Aaron', 'So the situation in Langport forty years ago was like<br/>this, too?!')
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', 'Indeed. No one was frozen in time, admittedly...')
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', "...but the Tyrant took control of the city's people<br/>using the dragon veins from Heilong Cheng Zhai.")
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', "Invisible spirits ran rampant through Langport's<br/>streets, stealing the energy of those who lived.")
('Rixia', 'I remember hearing something similar from my<br/>own father.')
('Chief Engineer Giscard', 'I do remember hearing about something crazy going<br/>on down there many years back.')
('Professor Hamilton', 'If I was asked to name more recent parallels, there are<br/>also the crises in Crossbell and Liberl four and six<br/>years ago respectively...')
('Professor Hamilton', 'As well as the civil war in the Empire four years ago,<br/>and the Battle of Jormungandr two years ago.')
('Quatre', 'Hmm...')
('Risette', 'Those stemmed in part from a great curse that spread<br/>across the land through the earth veins. They also<br/>spawned devils as well.')
('Agnès', 'R-Really?')
('Van', "...So what're we supposed to infer from the fact that<br/>what's going on here is similar to all that?")
('Professor Hamilton', "I don't know. To my knowledge, the current time<br/>freeze has never happened anywhere before.")
('Professor Hamilton', 'Realizing Pandemonium on a country or even<br/>continent-wide scale is no mean feat.')
('Professor Hamilton', 'Especially in the area near a certain<br/>church-related facility. Am I wrong?')
('Bergard', 'You are very astute.')
('Dominion Celis', "You're not one of the three disciples for<br/>nothing, huh?")
('Feri', '...?')
('Van', "We're talking about the primal grounds, right?<br/>The original the others are based on bein' in Arteria.")
('Van', "The nearest one isn't anywhere in the capital<br/>though, right? Never mind here.")
('Bergard', "You are correct. Unlike the Empire's capital, this city<br/>didn't exist before the Middle Ages.")
('Bergard', 'It should come as no surprise that it is light on<br/>spiritual protection.')
('Dominion Celis', "On the plus side, at least that means the primal<br/>ground isn't gonna be used maliciously like it was in<br/>the Empire.")
('Aaron', "I feel like, right now, we're hearing a hell of a lot of<br/>stuff we shouldn't be...")
('Quatre', 'Still, I suppose what it all boils down to is that we<br/>need to be just a little cautious when appraising the<br/>current crisis, correct?')
('Professor Hamilton', 'Precisely.')
('Professor Hamilton', 'Van, I believe you and you alone hold the key to<br/>quelling this chaos.')
('Professor Hamilton', 'The devices that your great-grandfather left you will<br/>no doubt be essential as well, Agnès.')
('Professor Hamilton', "However, I don't believe you should obsess over the<br/>negative aspects of your role in this. Instead, take a<br/>close look at your surroundings.")
('Professor Hamilton', "Most of this city's people are frozen, but so many<br/>are not.")
('Professor Hamilton', 'And the sheer number who are not is a testament to<br/>just how many bonds and friendships you have<br/>formed with everyone around you.')
('Van', '...')
('Agnès', 'Professor Hamilton...')
('Bergard', 'Heh.')
('Van', 'I dunno what to say. How am I even supposed to<br/>argue with that?')
('Van', "I know that what's happening is my problem, but<br/>even now I still don't hold all the answers as to what's<br/>goin' on.")
('Van', "But I'll try not to dwell too much on that, and<br/>remember how many people have got my back.")
('Agnès', 'Van...')
('Professor Hamilton', "I'm glad to hear that. I'm sure that will be the key to<br/>opening a path forward.")
('Quatre', "Right. And we'll be right there with you, of course.")
('Quatre', "I don't feel like I've just been drawn into<br/>this randomly.")
('Quatre', 'This must be at least somewhat connected to my<br/>birth and circumstances as well.')
('Feri', 'Oh!')
('Quatre', 'Why, Mom? Why, Dad?')
('Quatre', "I don't...want this... I don't want to be...")
('Agnès', 'Quatre...')
('Professor Hamilton', '...')
('Judith', '(I wonder if... No, this is no time to be speculating.)')
('Van', "We'll be countin' on you, Arkride Solutions<br/>technical advisor. Gonna have to keep your grandson<br/>on the clock a while longer, Professor.")
('Professor Hamilton', 'Of course. I can tell that he, FIO, and XEROS are as<br/>much a part of your group as anyone.')
('Professor Hamilton', 'Do your best, Quatre. But always behave like an<br/>engineer should: calmly and methodically.')
('Quatre', 'I will, Gran!')
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Heh. You're an artisan of Basel, lad. Go do us proud.")
('Rixia', '...Do they remind you of Cao and<br/>your grandchildren?')
('Rixia', 'Including Aaron, of course.')
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', 'Heh. You have grown emotional, Yin—though<br/>perhaps that is a source of strength to you now<br/>as well.')
('Aaron', '...')
('Aaron', "Anyway, not to interrupt everyone's goodfeels<br/>bonding time, but what are we gonna do next?")
('Aaron', "We've got all our people together now, so are we<br/>gonna hit up the other spheres?")
('Van', "Hmm... I was thinkin' that at first, but the rest of<br/>them are likely in the city's southern suburbs.")
('Van', "Even if we do have my pickup back now, that's a bit<br/>of a trek.")
('Risette', 'Indeed. There are some impassable areas on the<br/>way, too.')
('Feri', 'Then that just leaves...')
('Agnès', 'The place this catastrophe first began—the<br/>Vantail District.')
('Quatre', "That's right. The area Melchior says he's got<br/>protected with a giant barrier.")
('Judith', "He said we'd need to go around destroying all of the<br/>demon spheres to get through it, right?")
('Van', 'Yeah. He could be lying out his ass, mind. But either<br/>way, I do wanna know what things are like in there.')
('Van', 'Maybe we should go check it out.')
('Dominion Celis', 'Hmm... I wish we could ask Auclair what she<br/>managed to learn.')
('Dominion Celis', 'She said she was going to look into what was<br/>causing this.')
('Van', 'She did?!')
('Quatre', 'Sh-She did run off in the direction of the pillar, come<br/>to think of it.')
('Rixia', 'Which would mean she was heading towards the<br/>Vantail District.')
('Yumé', 'Elaine was the lovely lady who helped us!')
('Agnès', 'W-Wait!')
('Van', 'You saw her?!')
('Paulette', "That's right. Maxim dragged the two of us away from<br/>Vantail, where we were when the crisis began...")
('Paulette', "But on the way, we ended up getting separated from<br/>him, and that's when she showed up and rescued us.")
('Paulette', 'She was with a woman on a motorbike—and it was<br/>that woman who then saw us to safety.')
('Van', "That must've been Hermès!")
('Aaron', 'Heh. That sounds like her, all right.')
('Agnès', 'What happened to Elaine after that, then?')
('Yumé', "She said something about saying 'hi' to you for her and<br/>then ran off!")
('Yumé', 'But it was towards that shiny pillar thingy, yeah!')
('Paulette', 'Thinking back, though, not long after that, the area<br/>she ran into lit up and some kind of symbol appeared.')
('Paulette', 'Could that have been the barrier?')
('Van', "Hmm... If that's true, she must've slipped in there on<br/>her own before the barrier really went up.")
('Van', 'First the crazy stuff she pulled in Oración, now this...<br/>She really is something else.')
('Agnès', 'Van...')
('Feri', "I-I'm sure she's just fine! She's really strong, after all.")
('Bergard', 'Indeed. I do not doubt that she is working to resolve<br/>this in her own way.')
('Van', "Yeah. So we've gotta let her do her thing while we<br/>handle stuff that can only be done from the outside.")
('Van', 'I wanna enlist the help of the others so that we can—')
('Judith', 'Are they calling us again?!')
('Risette', "I don't think so. I'd say the fact that only Ms. Claudel<br/>is being called indicates...")
('Agnès', 'Oh!')
('Renne', "Hello, Agnès. I see you're all gathered?")
('Agnès', 'Renne!')
('Van', 'You got the communications network back online?!')
('Dominion Celis', "Sh-She really is somethin' else, huh?")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "She's a bona fide genius, that's for sure.")
('Professor Hamilton', "I wouldn't expect any less from her. I take it this is a<br/>simulation of the orbal network rather than the actual<br/>one, then?")
('Renne', "Oh, I didn't know Professor Hamilton was with you.<br/>Yes, that's right, but you still should be able to use it<br/>for everything you need.")
('Renne', 'I contacted Associate Professor Esmeray and<br/>Professor Cronkite just before calling all of you, but I<br/>would appreciate your help as well.')
('Renne', 'We need as many heads as we can working on how to<br/>get through that barrier.')
('Professor Hamilton', 'Of course. I have an orbal computer here with me, so<br/>I can get to work right away.')
('Agnès', "I guess this means we can call each other's<br/>Xiphas again?")
('Aaron', "Man, that's awesome.")
('Quatre', "It sure looks like it! I've got a pile of unread mail here.")
('Risette', 'Would you like me to contact your friends and<br/>family, too?')
('Paulette', 'Could you?! Oh, thank you!')
('Yumé', "I wanna know if they're okay, too!")
('Agnès', 'Renne really is amazing.')
('Van', "Yeah. The air's all full of hope all of a sudden just<br/>'cause of her.")
('Van', "I should try callin' Elaine just in—")
('Van', 'Ghh... Ugh...!')
('Agnès', 'Van!')
('Judith', "What's up with you all of a sudden?!")
('Feri', "They're just interrupting us?!")
('Renne', 'These blasted...! Trying to force their way into our<br/>ca—')
('Melchior', 'The demon spheres in the 3rd, 11th, and 12th<br/>districts have been destroyed.')
('Melchior', "Big congrats! I see you've managed to get your<br/>communications network back online, too, which<br/>means we're ramping up for the grand finale.")
('Melchior', 'Yet you still have a whole two and a half hours<br/>to spare... Looks like I made this a little too easy.')
('Melchior', "I wouldn't want you to feel bored during the big<br/>climax, though. Which is why I've decided to add<br/>ANOTHER barrier around Vantail!")
('Van', '...!')
('Renne', 'What?!')
('Agnès', 'Oh, no...')
('Aaron', "This isn't good...")
('Melchior', "Ahaha! I think I might have overdone it a little—but<br/>your chances aren't zero, so maybe hope<br/>will prevail!")
('Melchior', 'Well, keep up the good work! Your end is in sight! ㈱')
('Van', "(Not like we couldn't see this coming... It's just close<br/>to the worst hand we could've possibly been dealt.)")
('Van', '(If it really comes to it...)')
('Judith', "That scumbag's really done it this time!")
('Judith', "Who does he think he is?! Well if he thinks this is<br/>gonna make us give up, he's got another<br/>thing coming!")
('Rixia', "You're absolutely right, Judith.")
('Feri', "I couldn't agree more!")
('Bergard', 'Heh. I imagine he is frustrated that we were able to<br/>restore communications and destroy all the spheres<br/>so quickly.')
('Aaron', "Yeah. What he's doin' pisses me off, but it's just proof<br/>he's really starting to lose his cool.")
('Dominion Celis', 'That makes sense to me.')
('Risette', 'We still have two and a half hours left. That should<br/>be enough time to formulate a strategy.')
('Professor Hamilton', "Indeed. It's time to put our heads together, combine<br/>our strength, and show them what we can really do<br/>when we're united.")
('Professor Hamilton', "We'll do all that we can to get you into the<br/>Vantail District.")
('Renne', 'Indeed. If you can get in there, victory is as good<br/>as ours.')
('Renne', "You've got plenty of collaborators waiting to help<br/>you, too! ♪")
('Van', '...!')
('Quatre', "You've got everyone all together in a<br/>group conversation!")
('Yumé', 'Whoa...')
('Risette', 'Heehee. There are so many people.')
('Agnès', 'These are just some of the bonds and connections<br/>that Van has formed with his actions...')
('Paulette', 'Heehee. You really are fortunate, Van.')
('Van', 'Man... I dunno what to say, you guys.')
('Van', "All right. I don't care how long I'm in debt to you<br/>guys for this. Gimme all you got!")
('Van', "I'm countin' on you all—so you better step up!")
(40801, 'Right!')
('Agnès', 'We never managed to get in touch with Elaine in the<br/>end, did we?')
('Quatre', 'Yeah. I suspect those barriers around the Vantail<br/>District are impeding the signal.')
('Van', "No doubt. I'm sure she's just fine in there, though.")
('Feri', "Me, too! We've just got to get in there ourselves and<br/>find her!")
('Aaron', "Heh. She is kinda scary, but she'll be a huge help on<br/>our side.")
('Hermès', 'So glad I managed to catch you!')
('Van', 'Hermès!')
('Risette', 'We had heard you were with Ms. Auclair.')
('Hermès', 'I was for a while, helping her to get around.')
('Hermès', "But eventually she entrusted me with that mother and<br/>child's safety and went off alone—and then that<br/>barrier appeared.")
('Hermès', "I'm so sorry, Arkride. I should've stopped her.")
('Van', "Don't get too hung up about it. Bracers like her have<br/>their own way of doin' things.")
('Van', "We're heading in ourselves, either way.")
('Agnès', 'Of course!')
('Bergard', 'We were actually about to start preparing to do so.')
('Hermès', "Really? That's a relief.")
('Hermès', "I'm happy to resume my usual service for you, by<br/>the way. It's the least I can do by way of apology.")
('Hermès', "I've found plenty of good routes around the city, so I<br/>can gather whatever you need and see it delivered<br/>to you.")
('Van', "Heh. Cheers, that'll be a big help.")
('Judith', "We're counting on you!")
('Hermès', "Just give me a call if you need me. I'm at your service!")
('Van', "All right, we've got less than two hours left.<br/>It's almost time to wrap up this thing.")
('Risette', "Indeed. Everyone else's preparations are expected to<br/>be done around the one hour mark.")
('Agnès', "We're going to need to head for the expressway into<br/>the Vantail District, right?")
('Van', "Yeah. But this is gonna be our final battle, so we<br/>gotta make absolutely sure we're ready for it.")
('Van', "We're countin' on you, Quatre.")
('Quatre', 'Of course. FIO and XEROS are in top form, too.')
('Aaron', "Then let's move!")
('Feri', 'Onward and upward!')
('System', 'Quatre rejoined the party.')
('System', 'You can now access the Custom menu from<br/>Orbment in the main menu once more.')
('System', 'Feri can no longer use the Procyon Fang craft.')
('System', "You can use Hermès' courier service once more.<br/>To request a delivery, inspect Van's car and select<br/>the Order Delivery option.")
('System', 'When you wish to advance the main story, inspect<br/>the car or open the Travel menu and choose<br/>Head to Expressway 1 in the Auber District.')
('Paulette', 'Van... You and your crew are off, then?')
('Van', "Yeah. Don't got a lot of time left anyway.")
('Van', 'We gotta get this taken care of—')
('Van', 'Oh.')
('Agnès', 'Yumé?')
('Yumé', "Van... You're coming back, right?")
('Van', 'I...')
('Van', "Yeah, yeah. Don't worry, kiddo. I'm just stepping out<br/>for a bit.")
('Van', "We need to hold a party after everything's<br/>done, yeah? Back home at Montmart.")
('Yumé', '...You promise?')
('Van', 'Yeah. I promise.')
('Yumé', 'Okay... Okay!')
('Yumé', 'Agnès, Feri, everyone, please take care of Van!')
('Van', "What? I don't need—")
('Agnès', 'Heehee, of course we will, Yumé!')
('Feri', "We're all coming back safe!")
('Van', "Well, if everyone's done giving their permission, can<br/>we go now—")
('Maxim', 'Paulette! Yumé!')
('Paulette', 'Oh, Maxim...')
('Maxim', "Y-You're both safe! Oh, thank you, Goddess.<br/>Thank you!")
('Van', "Calm down there, champ. Don't just barge in and start<br/>freaking out.")
('Agnès', "I think it's fair for him to freak out a little.")
('Yumé', "Maxim's crying again!")
('Paulette', "I appreciate your concern, Maxim... And I'm glad<br/>you're doing well, too.")
('Paulette', "I...really am glad you're safe.")
('Maxim', 'Paulette!')
('Aaron', 'Man, what a sad sack. Can we go now?')
('Risette', 'Yes. We ought to give them some privacy.')
('Maxim', '*sniff* W-Wait up!')
('Maxim', "I can't even begin to repay you for helping Paulette<br/>and Yumé.")
('Maxim', "It barely cuts it as thanks, but I'd like to give you all<br/>special seats to the Z1 Grand Prix.")
('Maxim', 'You better make sure you come back to enjoy it!')
('Quatre', 'I would actually like seeing the grand prix.')
('Van', 'Got it, champ.')
('Yumé', 'Come back soon, everyone!')
('Bishop Orwell', 'All right, I think I largely understand.')
('Bishop Orwell', "While I don't intend to encourage your<br/>illicit activities...")
('Bishop Orwell', '...I do, however, agree that something must be done<br/>about Almata and their legacy.')
('Bishop Orwell', "You're welcome to come and go from here as needed<br/>while you're in the capital.")
('Dominion Celis', 'How very kind of you.')
('Dominion Celis', "Nah, but seriously. I appreciate the help. I was kinda<br/>expectin' every higher up in the Congregation for<br/>Divine Worship to have a stick jammed up their—")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "Celis, you're being rude.")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "However, I will agree that it's a little surprising.")
('Bishop Orwell', "Hardly. Let's just say that arrangements had been<br/>made by someone else already.")
('Bishop Orwell', 'And speaking of them.')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'My, what a coincidence.')
('Dominion Celis', 'Father Bark—wait, shit. I mean, Master Bergard!')
('Bergard', "Celis, Leon. It's been about a week.")
('Bergard', "Nice to see you, too, Bishop Orwell. It's been a while.<br/>I appreciate you making arrangements.")
('Bishop Orwell', "Don't mention it. We might not be part of the same<br/>organization, but you always did well by me when you<br/>were on active duty.")
('Bishop Orwell', "Now, if you'll excuse me, I shall take my leave.<br/>Take however much time you need, all of you.")
('Dominion Celis', "Guess they probably would've kicked us out the door<br/>if it wasn't for you, eh, Master?")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "Though we've managed quite a lot on our own.")
('Bergard', "Now, now. Don't be so put out. Building bridges<br/>where there used to be none takes time.")
('Bergard', "So, what's the current status? I do not believe the<br/>rubble's been cleared in Oración yet.")
('Dominion Celis', 'Right. About that...')
('Dominion Celis', "Oh. You're still sticking with these jerks, Master?")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "I was under the impression you were merely<br/>accompanying them as matter of necessity and that<br/>you'd part ways after business was settled in Oración.")
('Aaron', 'You know you can just say hello, right?')
('Van', "Ain't gonna deny we're not cut from the<br/>cleanest cloth.")
('Bergard', "Let us just say it's a complicated matter. For the time<br/>being, it would be far more beneficial to stick with<br/>them than act alone.")
('Bergard', "It isn't too unlike the reason that brought you to the<br/>capital in the first place.")
('Dominion Celis', 'Heh, you never pull a punch.')
('Dominion Celis', 'We left the Second Dominion in charge of cleaning<br/>up that mess.')
('Dominion Celis', 'Those partitions of his should help look for shit faster<br/>than I ever could.')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "Abbas' team also arrived to lend a hand.")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "He's been acting separately from Wazy quite<br/>often lately.")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "Though I guess that's what you ought to expect of a<br/>master of the Kunlun school.")
('Bergard', "Heh. I will leave you two to it, then. I'm glad you're<br/>doing well.")
('Bergard', 'Hopefully I will get to see them sometime. Kevin and<br/>Gaius, too.')
('Dominion Celis', "Please. Maybe that'll get 'em off our backs.")
('Dominion Celis', "The commander's not said shit, so they're botherin' us<br/>about it instead.")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "That's the commander for you. Were they to upset<br/>her, she would sooner drink them under the table<br/>than speak frankly. They are aware of that.")
('Feri', "They're having fun.")
('Aaron', "How much of a big deal is gramps?<br/>Someone's fawning over him everywhere we go.")
('Agnès', 'He looks to be very well acquainted and respected by<br/>a lot of high ranking individuals.')
('Van', "He's got a lot of apprentices outside the church,<br/>like me.")
('Van', 'But...')
('Van', "(Why would these idiots be all the way here?<br/>What's so important to leave artifact retrieval to<br/>someone else?)")
('Van', "(They were talking about Almata's legacy? Could<br/>that mean... No, it can't, can it?)")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'Hmm?')
('Dominion Celis', "Somethin' buggin' you, Arkride? Need to let some<br/>steam off?")
('Dominion Celis', "We never declared a proper victor for that little game,<br/>so why don'tcha square up for another round?")
('Van', "Mind chillin' for just one second? If you've got some<br/>pent up energy, go bother someone else.")
('Van', "'Sides, lotta other players are out here in the<br/>capital today.")
('Van', 'Not that that might have anything to do with why<br/>you two are here.')
('Dominion Celis', 'Tch.')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'Do feel free to guess.')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "I'd love to hope for nothing to happen whatsoever,<br/>but we're not naïve enough to let our guard down.<br/>We're merely here as insurance.")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'Not unlike you, spriggan.')
('Van', "Fine. Guess you've got a point.")
('Bergard', 'Hmm...')
('Agnès', '(...)')
('Feri', '(They get along like cats and dogs.)')
('Quatre', "(They're not even trying to hide it.)")
('Aaron', '(Pretty boy over there looks like he has a bone to pick<br/>with Van.)')
('Judith', "(But I don't think it has anything to do<br/>with Bergard.)")
('Risette', "(It doesn't look like Mr. Zeman is the cause of<br/>the animosity, however.)")
('Dominion Celis', 'Oh, man. These pancakes are THE shit!')
('Dominion Celis', "You really do know what you're talking about!")
('Rixia', "You're right, it IS good! The butter gives it such<br/>richness, and the flavor only deepens the longer I<br/>taste it.")
('Elaine', "I'm glad you enjoy them. They've been one of my<br/>favorites since I was a student.")
('Elaine', "Though I'm nowhere near their biggest fan. I know<br/>someone who could probably talk at length about<br/>every—")
('Elaine', 'Wait, Van? When did you get here?!')
('Van', "Gettin' real cozy there, talkin' about<br/>personal information. Guess you can be laidback<br/>sometimes when you want to, A-rank bracer.")
('Agnès', "Ahaha... Hello, everyone. Haven't seen you since<br/>the afterparty.")
('Feri', 'Hi, there! I guess this is the first time since the<br/>afterparty we get to talk.')
('Aaron', "That's one bunch of women that could kick some<br/>serious ass. Haven't seen you ladies since<br/>the afterparty.")
('Risette', "Greetings, everyone. I don't believe we've had a<br/>chance to meet since the afterparty.")
('Quatre', "Ah. Hello, everyone. Haven't seen you since<br/>the afterparty.")
('Judith', "Elaine, Celis! Heya, I haven't seen you since<br/>the afterparty!")
('Judith', "And you, Rixia. You're gonna be going on the three<br/>o'clock train, right?")
('Rixia', 'Yes. I was planning on picking up some souvenirs<br/>before I headed back.')
('Bergard', "I haven't seen your group since the afterparty.")
('Dominion Celis', "Hey, Master. You're here, too?")
('Dominion Celis', "Leon and I split up. We're just lookin' around,<br/>like you.")
('Dominion Celis', 'I was almost done with my round when I bumped<br/>into these two.')
('Dominion Celis', "We got to talk a bit during the afterparty and stuff, so<br/>I said why not take a break and chat a li'l.")
('Rixia', "I'll be heading back to Crossbell after this.")
('Rixia', "But I'm glad I was able to be here for the festival.<br/>I don't come home often, but I'm glad I did this time.<br/>It was worth it.")
('Van', 'Right...')
('Aaron', "Nothing says you can't come again in a year.")
('Judith', 'I mean, you can always pop by next year.')
('Van', 'Why not make a habit of it?')
('Rixia', "I would love to, but Arc en Ciel keeps me so busy I<br/>might not be able to. I'll definitely keep it in<br/>mind, though.")
('Rixia', "I would love to, but Arc en Ciel keeps me so busy I<br/>might not be able to. I'll definitely keep it in<br/>mind, though.")
('Elaine', "Ahem. While there's nothing wrong with keeping an<br/>eye on things, of course...")
('Elaine', 'You should maybe hold off on taking any strange<br/>jobs today.')
('Elaine', "Yes, the last remnants of A were taken out as of three<br/>days ago and it doesn't look like anyone else is on the<br/>move yet...")
('Elaine', "...but it doesn't hurt to be cautious. There will<br/>definitely be pushback, so this calm before the storm<br/>is time you should take to rest and recover.")
('Van', 'Yeah, yeah, I get it. Look at you, still playing the part<br/>of good vice prez.')
('Van', 'Just like that time you drilled a lecture into my skull<br/>when you caught me skipping classes to come here.')
('Elaine', 'Why, exactly, are you making it look like it was<br/>my fault? That was entirely on you!')
('Elaine', 'And may I remind you I was the Student Council<br/>PRESIDENT after the second year? You did a<br/>campaign speech for me!')
('Van', "Not so much 'did' as 'René dumped it on me<br/>last minute.'")
('Van', "Winged most of it, to be honest. But hey, it worked!<br/>You can't complain.")
('Elaine', "Oh, can't complain. Especially about that part about<br/>me beating up those thugs and busting corrupt staff.<br/>That really helped my campaign!")
('Elaine', 'Do you have ANY idea how scared everyone was to<br/>approach me the year after my election?!')
('Van', 'Okay, but...that actually, literally happened.')
('Van', "And don't forget about gettin' flooded with fan mail<br/>after the fact. I'd say it prepared you real nice for your<br/>current job, eh?")
('Elaine', 'YOU!')
('Rixia', "(Haha, they're so close it's adorable.)")
('Dominion Celis', "(And they're REALLY not going out?)")
('Agnès', '(As I understand it, not anymore.)')
('Feri', '(Apparently they did long ago, but not anymore.)')
('Aaron', '(Apparently had the hots for each other back in the<br/>day, but not anymore. Dunno if I buy that crap.)')
('Risette', '(I dare say that is something only they can answer<br/>for you.)')
('Quatre', "(Hmm. Not from what I've heard, no. At least<br/>not now.)")
('Judith', '(I guess they USED to be an item...)')
('Bergard', '(That is a question only they have the answer to.)')
('Quatre', 'Hey, everyone. Keeping an eye on things?')
('Van', "Yup. I heard Professor Hamilton's come by?")
('Van', "Professor Hamilton! I'd heard you had come by.")
('Professor Hamilton', "Hello there, and happy Revolution Festival.<br/>Haven't seen you this past month.")
('Agnès', "Oh, hello. It's been some time. A-And, um...it's a<br/>surprise to see you here, as well.")
('Feri', "It's been a while. And, uh...I didn't expect to see<br/>you here.")
('Aaron', 'Hey there, old man. What are you doing here with<br/>the Professor?')
('Risette', 'A pleasure to see you again. And it seems you have an<br/>unexpected acquaintance.')
('Quatre', 'I was going to stop by to pay my respects as well later.')
('Quatre', "But that aside, I didn't think that you two knew<br/>each other.")
('Judith', "(So that's the famous professor.)<br/>Wait, but what're you doing here with her?")
('Bergard', 'It has been about half a month for me, Professor.<br/>Good to see you are also well, Giscard.')
('Professor Hamilton', "So it has. Though we missed each other, didn't we?")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Bark—no. It's Bergard now, right? Good to see<br/>you again.")
('Van', "Huh. How 'bout that. Thought you mighta known<br/>each other.")
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', "Well, we're roughly the same age, after all. We've met<br/>before, here and there.")
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', "Both the Great Spire and the Luozhou Bridge are<br/>the professor's designs, after all.")
('Aaron', "I'd heard about that.")
('Quatre', 'Really? I had heard of them before, but I<br/>never knew...')
('Risette', 'Is that correct? I only knew of them by name.')
('Feri', "Oooh! You're talking about the big building and the<br/>bridge connecting the two districts!")
('Agnès', 'I had no idea...')
('Judith', "Oh, right. That's the big building and the bridge that<br/>connects the two districts?")
('Bergard', 'That brings back memories.')
('Chief Engineer Giscard', 'I still remember how the budget was so tight<br/>regarding the specs that it could make both workers<br/>and artisans weep.')
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "All the mira in the world, and you couldn't cut us<br/>some slack.")
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', "You've quite the low opinion on<br/>Langport businessmen. Do remember, no expense<br/>was spared when it came to worker safety.")
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', "As far as I'm concerned, it's the artisan's task to see a<br/>plan realized at a reasonable price. The professor's<br/>plans should not be an exception.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', 'I swear! Just you wait till the high-speed orbal<br/>network expansions and the new Red Star factory<br/>are done!')
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "You won't have a single complaint once those<br/>are done! And then I don't want to see you be so<br/>stingy with bonuses!")
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', 'Heh. Is that so? I am very much looking forward to it<br/>now, I assure you.')
('Quatre', "Huh. I'd heard people talk about them bickering.<br/>Guess that's how it's always been for them.")
('Aaron', "The old man looks like he's having fun.")
('Professor Hamilton', "Well, they're both largely responsible for the<br/>Republic's development. They might bicker like dogs,<br/>but they get along quite well.")
('Professor Hamilton', 'The orbal network continues growing, and the<br/>distance between people in the Republic continues to<br/>shrink with it. The entire continent will follow.')
('Professor Hamilton', 'Which brings us to the topic at hand, that being the<br/>current state of the Eastern part of the continent.<br/>I trust you understand what I mean, Gien.')
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', '...!')
('Van', '...')
('Quatre', 'Ah...')
('Agnès', "(I understand what she's talking about.)")
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', 'Heh. You really are not someone to be<br/>underestimated, Professor.')
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', 'Shall we move on to the main topic, then?')
('Professor Hamilton', 'Gladly.')
('Van', "(This is about the desertification happening in<br/>eastern Zemuria. Even the president's been<br/>getting involved.)")
('Van', "(Your Gran's one hell of a woman.)")
('System', '(Agreed. This matter is one that no one should turn a<br/>blind eye to.)')
('Feri', '(Well, this will affect everyone, sooner or later.)')
('Aaron', "(Yeah. This shit's got to do with all of us. Even the<br/>old man can see that.)")
('Judith', '(I mean, this problem affects everyone. The professor<br/>is even more impressive than the rumors<br/>said, though...)')
('Bergard', '(Heh... I understand. This is a problem no one can<br/>really ignore.)')
('Quatre', "(Well, yeah. She's been an important figurehead for<br/>half a century.)")
('Quatre', "(Well, yeah. She's been an important figurehead for<br/>half a century.)")
('Agnès', 'Come to think of it... I believe they were going to<br/>hammer out the last bits of the plan in the Aramis<br/>Student Council room.')
('Feri', 'Oh, really?')
('Van', "Yeah. Prez enhanced the local connections so it's<br/>probably as good a place as any to finish it all up.")
('Van', "Professor Hamilton's sticking around, right?")
('Quatre', "Yeah. I think Essy said she'd be here, too.")
('Judith', "Sounds like they're gonna be really busy. Maybe we<br/>shouldn't bother them...")
('Risette', "I can't imagine it would hurt to stop by, at least for<br/>moral support.")
('Aaron', "Guess we're paying Miss Perfect's school a visit.<br/>Oh, and our esteemed chief's alma mater, too.")
('Van', 'I mean, I never graduated.')
('Feri', 'Heehee! Sounds exciting!')
('Agnès', "Let me show you to the Student Council room, then.<br/>It's on the fourth floor.")
('Renne', "*sigh* It's frustrating, but I have to admit it's<br/>performing quite well.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "I wonder what's the whole story behind this...")
('Professor Hamilton', "We can talk about that later. Right now, our goal is<br/>maximizing the plan's success rate.")
('Professor Hamilton', 'Celis, could you measure the spiritual wavelength<br/>pattern through the Xipha one more time?')
('Dominion Celis', "Sure, whatever. No problem.<br/>(Maybe if I knew what the hell I'm doing...)")
('Agnès', 'Pardon us. Mind if we come in?')
('Renne', 'Oh, you came to visit? Feel free to come in.')
('Feri', 'Wow! This is what a Student Council room looks like<br/>on the inside!')
('Judith', "Oooh, even I'd be thrilled to learn in a place as classy<br/>as this.")
('Quatre', "Gran, Essy, Renne? We've come to visit.")
('Aaron', "Oh, it's the punkass knight.")
('Bergard', "You're lending a hand here, are you?")
('Dominion Celis', "Why don'tcha say that again and see how much of a<br/>punk I can be?! ...But anyway, it's apparently got<br/>something to do with the plan.")
('Dominion Celis', 'Leon already went ahead, by the way.')
('Risette', "I see. We'll inquire with him once we're on location.")
('Risette', "I see you were able to obtain one of Marduk's<br/>latest terminals.")
('Renne', "We did. It's the only way we could access the orbal<br/>network in virtual mode.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "Don't worry so much about the specifics. We'll talk<br/>about everything during the mission.")
('Van', "Got it. Wasn't worried anyway. I trust you guys.")
('Bergard', 'Glad to have your assistance, Professor. And the rest<br/>of you, too. Celis, do what you can for them.')
('Dominion Celis', 'You got it, boss!<br/>(When I figure out what the hell to do, but hey.)')
('Professor Hamilton', "We'll head to the rendezvous point in about an hour.")
('Professor Hamilton', "Van, Agnès, everyone. Make sure everyone's ready for<br/>the mission.")
('Van', 'Got it.')
('Agnès', 'Understood!')
('FIO', 'Commencing proximity probe.')
('FIO', 'Response found! Heat signature detected!')
('FIO', 'Commencing proximity probe.')
('FIO', 'Response found! Heat signature detected!')
('FIO', 'Commencing proximity probe.')
('FIO', 'Response found! Heat signature detected!')
('Van', 'Right here, then?')
('Agnès', 'Yes. The dorms are close by, so this should be a<br/>good spot.')
('Agnès', "Umm... I'm not really sure if I can put this to words...")
('Agnès', "...but Arkride Solutions means the world to me, now.<br/>You're just as important to me as my family.")
('Agnès', "And I don't think I'm the only one who feels that<br/>way, either.")
('Van', '...')
('Agnès', "I'm sorry. Maybe now's not the time for that...")
('Agnès', 'But anyway, thank you for seeing me this far. I look<br/>forward to the trip!')
('Van', 'Sure. See you later.')
('Van', 'That sure caught me off guard.')
('Van', "I appreciate the thought. I just wish she wouldn't<br/>waste it on someone like me...")
('System', 'After that, Van spent part of the night driving before<br/>resuming his patrol.')
('System', "Van's group decided to take a short break.")
('System', 'Everyone split up so they could spend their free time<br/>as they pleased.')
('Van', "Well, damn. This place is lively. The festival's<br/>atmosphere is kinda contagious.")
('Van', "Hmm... Wonder what everyone's up to.")
('Van', '(Is that Feri?)')
('Feri', 'Oh, Van!')
('Feri', 'Funny running into you!')
('Van', "You looked like you were having fun.<br/>Wasn't expecting you to be part of the event.")
('Van', "Caught me off guard. Don't get me wrong, though.<br/>Song's nice.")
('Feri', 'Aww, thank you!')
('Feri', 'Actually, I got a letter from Abi just a bit ago.')
('Feri', "He said I'll be participating in the Kruga village's<br/>New Year's Festival!")
('Feri', "I'll be the priestess this year.")
('Van', "A priestess, huh? That some kinda Kruga New<br/>Year's tradition?")
('Feri', 'Yup! We thank the Winged Goddess, Arusha, for her<br/>guidance and pray for her to bless the upcoming year.')
('Feri', 'A woman in the village is chosen every year to play<br/>the role of priestess and sing the Song of Flames.')
('Feri', 'This will actually be my first time back home...')
('Feri', "I'll show them how much I've grown when I play the<br/>role of priestess!")
('Feri', "And I guess I thought that by performing here,<br/>I could learn something that'll make me<br/>stand out from all the other priestesses.")
('Van', 'Okay, I guess that makes sense. Practicing here could<br/>help with that.')
('Van', 'I can try lending you a hand, since your pops told me<br/>to take care of you.')
('Feri', 'Would you?! Thank you!')
('Van', "Don't go givin' thanks yet. I don't know a lick<br/>about singing. We might need someone else...")
('Shaheena', 'Wait, is that...')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'Van? And Feri, too!')
('Feri', 'Saara! Shaheena! Hi!')
('Van', "Well, ain't that a stroke of luck. Couldn't have asked<br/>for anyone better.")
('Feri', 'Oh, I see! Umm, excuse me! Could I ask you<br/>two something?')
('System', 'After explaining the situation, Saara and Shaheena<br/>happily agreed to help.')
('System', 'To start, they had Feri sing for them so they could<br/>evaluate her.')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "Feri, you're fantastic!")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'That was enchanting! It had a dignified and serene<br/>feeling to it.')
('Shaheena', "It's not an easy song, but you give it an identity of<br/>your own when you sing it.")
('Shaheena', 'Anyone listening to you will understand just how<br/>much this means to you. Emotions on full display like<br/>that draw people in.')
('Shaheena', "Honestly, I dunno if there's much advice we can<br/>give you. You're already great as it is.")
('Feri', 'Heehee, thank you! Hearing you say that<br/>is encouraging.')
('Feri', "It's not hard to sing with your heart, really.")
('Feri', "But I feel like something's still missing...")
('Van', "Maybe the thing you're missin' isn't in the song at all.<br/>Why not try dancing?")
('Van', 'Even a simple choreography might make a bigger<br/>impact than if you just sang the Song of Flames.')
('Feri', "Dancing! I hadn't thought of that, but it's a<br/>great idea!")
('Feri', 'I could try some of the dances Shaheena taught<br/>me already.')
('Shaheena', "Oooh, I like that idea! I'd love to see you try.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "If that's decided, then let's try to come up with a<br/>quick routine for you.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "Why don't you join us, Van? Since you're here<br/>and everything.")
('Van', 'Me? Pass. I was born with two left feet.')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "Haha, that's not what I meant! You don't need to<br/>dance, just accompany her.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'We brought a tabla with us, actually, to use in<br/>a performance.')
('Shaheena', 'Oh, yeah! That would make it easier to keep<br/>the rhythm.')
('Feri', "Van, please! I'll do better if you're here<br/>supporting me.")
('Van', "All right, fine. Can't say no to that.")
('Van', 'I guess I just beat the drum to match the mood?')
('Feri', "That'd be perfect! Let's give it our all!")
('System', 'With the combined help of Saara and Shaheena, Feri<br/>started practicing her performance.')
('System', 'Though it was difficult for her to balance<br/>singing and dancing at first...')
('System', '...her natural talents eventually shone through,<br/>helping her sing and dance in harmony.')
('System', 'And as Van slowly got the hang of the drums,<br/>everything came together for a new Song of Flames.')
('Feri', '*huff* *huff* ...Thank you so much!')
('Van', 'Phew! I think that one went pretty well.')
('Shaheena', 'That was stellar!')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "I'm sure this is just what you needed to impress at<br/>your New Year's Festival, Feri!")
('Feri', "Ahaha... If I do, it's thanks to you two and Van.")
('Feri', "I won't stop practicing until I can sing and dance like<br/>a proper priestess!")
('Van', 'And look at the timing here. The perfect audience<br/>just showed up.')
('Feri', 'Huh?')
('Vice Chief Hasan', "I'm glad to see you well, Ferida.")
('Feri', 'Abi, Kasim? Fie, too?!')
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', "Most impressive to see an employer so dedicated he'll<br/>even provide assistance to his staff in matters of song<br/>and dance.")
('Van', "Well, shit happens. Wasn't expecting a bunch of big<br/>shots like you to come by, though.")
('Fie', "I happened to bump into Marduk's security chief<br/>while I was patrolling Auber.")
('Fie', 'We were just walking around when we spotted<br/>you guys.')
('Fie', 'I was just as surprised as you to bump into a Kruga<br/>corps commander, though.')
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'Hah, well, I visit the capital from time to time to take<br/>care of business.')
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'I thought to stop by and see how Ferida was doing<br/>while I was at it.')
('Vice Chief Hasan', "You're doing even better than I expected.<br/>You've grown, Ferida, and it shows in the way you<br/>carry yourself.")
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'And that idea of yours, of dancing as you sing...')
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'I like it! Surely you agree as well, Kasim?')
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', "She's still got some work to do. Still unstable on her<br/>feet, so her movements aren't particularly smooth<br/>just yet.")
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', "...If you're going for this, be sure to do your utmost.")
('Feri', "Of course! I just started, so it's not the best right now,<br/>but I'll keep practicing! Look forward to me<br/>flooring you!")
('Fie', "(Huh. The security chief's advice was<br/>actually reasonable.)")
('Van', "(Maybe they're not that strained after all.)")
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'Oh, and Arkride? Let me congratulate you for a job<br/>well done in Oración.')
('Vice Chief Hasan', "Ferida's grown so much since I entrusted her to you.<br/>I haven't regretted that choice.")
('Van', "Glad to hear that. Would've appreciated a heads up<br/>before having a whole ass child dumped on me like<br/>that, though.")
('Van', "But she's pullin' her weight around the office, so<br/>all's good.")
('Vice Chief Hasan', "Hmph. Good to know. I'll leave my daughter in<br/>your care. She still has much to learn.")
('Vice Chief Hasan', "I'll be looking forward to seeing you for the New<br/>Year's Festival, Ferida.")
('Feri', 'Of course! Thank you, Abi!')
('Feri', 'You, too. Kasim, Fie.')
('Feri', "I'll do my best as priestess, and with the Song<br/>of Flames.")
('Feri', "That way I can prove to you how much I've grown!")
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', '...Hmph.')
('Fie', 'Aida would be happy for her, too.')
('Van', 'No doubt.')
('System', 'After they left, Saara and Shaheena helped Feri in<br/>practicing the Song of Flames for a while longer.')
('System', 'When they finished, Van and Feri said their<br/>goodbyes and left.')
('Van', "All right, I'm heading back. ...Somethin' up?")
('Feri', "No, no, it's just... I've grown so much, and I feel like I<br/>can keep growing even more if I stick with you, Van.")
('Feri', "Wherever you go, I'll follow.")
('Feri', 'So, thank you for continuing to take good care of me!')
('Van', "Heh. Pushy for a part-timer, aren't you?")
('Van', "Guess I'll keep on lookin' after you. Least I can do, as<br/>your boss.")
('Feri', 'Heehee. Of course.')
('System', "Van's group decided to take a short break.")
('System', 'Everyone split up so they could spend their free time<br/>as they pleased.')
('Renne', 'A spriggan request addressed towards both you<br/>and I...')
('Van', "Something stinks real bad about this one, but I don't<br/>think it's just a prank either.")
('Van', "Thoughts? I can handle it myself, if you'd like.")
('Renne', "That's fine. I'll lend you a hand.")
('Renne', "We've quite a few shared acquaintances, after all.<br/>It's worth looking into.")
('Van', '...')
('Renne', 'So? What is the request about?')
('Van', "A retrieval. Something's been smuggled into the city<br/>via the underground, and we're supposed to go get it.")
('Van', "The route there's pretty convoluted, and it looks like<br/>shit's been encrypted over and over a few times.")
('Van', 'Not gonna lie, this might be a little bit out of<br/>my depth.')
('Renne', "Lucky for you that I'm here.")
('Renne', "We both are perfectly suited for this matter, so let's<br/>cooperate and get to the bottom of this.")
('System', 'After agreeing to work together, Van and Renne<br/>decoded the 4SPG. They continued gathering clues<br/>afterward from the orbal net and the underworld.')
('System', 'Eventually, the trail led them to an attaché case.')
('Agnès', "I'm sorry to call you all of a sudden, Albert.")
('Albert', "It's all right. It looks like it's something you need to<br/>be discreet about.")
('Agnès', "Something like that. We're looking into someone<br/>right now. Do you know Curtis?")
('System', "Van's team told Albert what they'd heard from<br/>Curtis' mom.")
('System', "They also mentioned how he'd changed recently.")
('Albert', "Damn it, I knew something was up. He'd been acting<br/>strange lately...")
('Albert', 'Maybe unstable is the best word for it. It was very<br/>different from his usual self.')
('Van', 'How long have you known?')
('Albert', "Ugh... You know, I don't really want to help you.")
('Albert', 'But I guess I noticed it around late October,<br/>early November.')
('Albert', "He was pretty down in the dumps before that, saying<br/>he'd lost motivation.")
('Albert', 'But he then started being all excited about his studies<br/>all of a sudden.')
('Albert', "Something was off about it, though. I don't know<br/>where all the enthusiasm came from.")
('Agnès', 'Thank you for letting us know. Have you heard<br/>anything in particular about his friends?')
('Albert', "As if he was hanging around with a bad crowd?<br/>No, not really. Didn't look like it, anyway.")
('Albert', "Wait, maybe... It's not quite that...")
('Albert', 'But I remember someone that looked like him<br/>hanging around the backstreets in the Tyrell District.')
('Albert', "Since it was at night and the guy he was talking to<br/>looked real shady, I kinda just assumed it couldn't<br/>be Curtis.")
('Albert', "Damn it. Maybe that's the guy that...")
('Aaron', 'Come on. Stop mumbling and out with it already.')
('Agnès', "We've been warned at school to watch out for a<br/>suspicious man that hangs around Tyrell's backstreets.")
('Agnès', "He apparently sells tobacco and hard drugs to<br/>young people. That's what the rumors say, anyway.")
('Agnès', "...I should've made the connection earlier.<br/>Curtis could've bought the tablets from him!")
('Feri', 'That makes a lot of sense.')
('Feri', 'Maybe he was going to meet him today when he said<br/>he was going to the bookstore!')
('Van', 'Looks like it anyway.')
('Van', "Next stop: Tyrell's backstreets.")
('Albert', "Well, I'm glad I could be of help. Please, do<br/>something for Curtis.")
('Agnès', 'We will. Thank you for your help, Albert!')
('Van', '(Wait. I should make sure Agnès is here before I hit<br/>the store.)')
('Holland', "But let's not forget why you're here, yeah?")
('Holland', "If you're looking for something perfect for children,<br/>might I suggest our macarons?")
('Holland', "They're one of our seasonal flavors. We make them<br/>with the freshest strawberry jam, since those are in<br/>season now. Our shop's pride.")
('Van', 'Oh, yeah. That crunchy delight as you bite down on<br/>it, your mouth suddenly being flooded by that sweet<br/>and tangy cream filling...')
('Van', 'Oooh, I can almost taste it...')
('Holland', "Hah! Good to see you haven't changed a bit.")
('Holland', "Macarons aren't that expensive, either. I think they're<br/>pretty affordable for little kids.")
('Agnès', 'I think you sold me on them already. Can we get<br/>some macarons, please?')
('Agnès', "We'll get one for everyone to try them.")
('Van', "Okay. We're done visiting all the stores we wanted to.")
('Agnès', "We've also got plenty of things to try! Shall we head<br/>back to Odette?")
('System', 'Enter the Student Council Room?')
('System', 'Leave the Student Council Room?')
