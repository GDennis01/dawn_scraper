('Feri', 'Whoa... This path is so pretty.')
('Risette', 'The autumn leaves look beautiful. The cosmos seem<br/>to be at their peak, too.')
('Agnès', 'Yes. It almost feels like a waste to keep it sealed off.')
('Maxim', "M-Monsters...? But there weren't any here seven<br/>years ago.")
('Aaron', "We're gonna have more than just those little ones to<br/>deal with, too.")
('Maxim', '...What?')
('FIO', 'Warning! Warning! Large enemy presence detected!')
('Maxim', "Well, THAT doesn't sound good...")
('Quatre', 'That must be where the monster that rules this<br/>area is.')
('Quatre', 'Van.')
('Van', "I was thinkin' the same thing. This might be our<br/>perfect chance.")
('Agnès', "...If we must, we at least need to make sure we're<br/>ready first.")
('Risette', 'What will you do, Mr. Lugan? I suspect it will be<br/>safer for you to wait here at the entrance.')
('Maxim', "I could never do that! This memory means the world<br/>to me—I can't just leave it to you to recover it!")
('Maxim', "I'm confident in my reflexes and agility, if<br/>nothing else. So please, let me come with you.")
('Van', "Works for me. I think you'll be fine. Just keep hold of<br/>this for me, would ya?")
('Maxim', 'The shovel for digging up the capsule? O-Okay. Sure.')
('Aaron', "Use it if you gotta defend yourself, but don't<br/>be reckless. Stay behind us.")
('Feri', "It's just a precaution, though. Leave all the monsters<br/>to us!")
('Maxim', "There it is! That's the tree—I'm sure of it!")
('Agnès', 'Is the capsule buried under that stone, then?')
('Aaron', 'So, what? This some monument for<br/>braindead lovebirds?')
('Maxim', 'H-How dare you? It is under that monument,<br/>but still!')
('Maxim', "...What's that sound?")
('Van', 'Get back, champ!')
('Maxim', 'What is THAT?! A-A giant spider?!')
('Feri', 'One giant spider and six smaller ones!')
('Risette', "I suspect they'll be a force to be reckoned with!")
('Quatre', 'Van! Agnès!')
('Agnès', 'I have the Geneses right here!')
('Van', "There's no need to hold back against it! Just wear it<br/>down some and leave the rest to me!")
('Aaron', 'Fine by me. Leave it to us!')
('Maxim', 'Eeek! How is it still moving?!')
('Aaron', 'Get back behind us!')
('Feri', 'Van! Are you ready?')
('Van', "Yeah. I'm counting on you guys!")
('Quatre', 'Right! Start the recording, FIO!')
('Risette', "I'll back you up however I can!")
('Agnès', 'Please be careful, Van!')
('Maxim', "Wh-What in Aidios' name is he doing?")
('Maxim', "Why are you all just standing there? There's no way<br/>he can take much more of this!")
('Feri', 'We know that!')
('Aaron', 'Just shut up and watch!')
('Risette', 'Mr. Arkride will be just fine. We believe in him.')
('Agnès', '(Oh, Goddess above...please keep him safe.)')
('Van', '(NOW!)')
('Quatre', 'This is it!')
('FIO', 'Phase space expansion confirmed.')
('Aaron', 'And here we are.')
('Feri', "We're inside, too?")
('Risette', '...Save for Mr. Lugan, it would seem.')
('Quatre', "Perhaps it's like the combat links used in the Empire?<br/>Or an application of the SCLM system?")
('Mare', "You call, and I answeeer! ...Uh, what's going on?!")
('Agnès', 'Mare!')
('Aaron', 'Heh. She finally shows up.')
('Feri', 'She really is cute...')
('Quatre', "A hologram? No, it's more like our collective<br/>unconscious is being hacked through<br/>spiritual resonance.")
('Risette', 'Indeed. She appears to be an AI powerful enough to<br/>perform the vast calculations that would require.')
('Van', "You've saved us from a lotta close calls in the past, but<br/>I guess this is our first chance to have a proper talk.")
('Van', 'Just what are you, Mare-Bear? Why do you have a<br/>sense of self like this?')
('Mare', 'Will you stop calling me that?! Besides, you know<br/>who I am!')
('Mare', "I'm your one-of-a-kind, fantabulous holo, Mare!<br/>Model MK-ESV004!")
('Mare', "I'm being gracious enough to lend you a helping<br/>hand as a ㌍㌫㌻㍊㍍ under the influence of<br/>the ㌍㌫㌻㍊㍍!")
('Van', 'Wait... What?')
('Agnès', "There was nothing to stop us hearing what she said,<br/>but even then, I just...couldn't comprehend it.")
('Risette', 'Indeed...<br/>(I remember reading about this phenomenon in the<br/>reports from Crossbell and the Empire.)')
('Mare', 'Ugh... This is so annoying.')
('Mare', "...What's this? Are you recording what's<br/>happening here?")
('Quatre', "That's right. We'd prefer to not have to go through<br/>all this every time we want to see you.")
('Quatre', 'So we were hoping there was a way to recreate the<br/>process and better control the Grendel without<br/>deliberately exposing Van to danger.')
('Mare', 'I see. You humans do think of some fascinating ideas.')
('Mare', 'Even if your methods are a little primitive.')
('Aaron', 'Fighting words for a fun-sized pipsqueak.')
('Mare', 'Y-You watch your mouth, redhead!')
('Feri', 'P-Please! This is no time for fighting!')
('Van', '...So you can do it, right?')
('Agnès', 'Please, Ms. Mare! We need your help!')
('Mare', "And now we've tacked on 'miss'... Well, whatever.")
('Mare', 'Just be careful. Using it too much will<br/>cause ㌍㌫㌻㍊㌫㍊㌻㍊㌫㍍.')
('Mare', "As long as you're mindful of that, go ahead and<br/>decipher the recreation process from your logs later.")
('Quatre', 'Right... Understood!')
('Maxim', 'AAAAAAHH!')
('Feri', 'Stay back, please!')
('Aaron', 'Haha! You did it!')
('Agnès', 'Van!')
(61451, 'RAAAAAAAHH!')
('Van/Grendel', 'OHHHHHHHH!')
('System', 'Found <br/>.')
('System', 'Found <br/>.')
('Van', '*pant* *pant*')
('Feri', 'Van!')
('Agnès', 'Are you okay?!')
('Van', "Yeah... I'm exhausted, but I'm not hurtin'.")
('Aaron', 'Too much of a workout for the old bones, huh?')
('Van', 'Shut up. ...So, did it work?')
('Quatre', 'Yeah. It looks like I recorded everything just fine.')
('Risette', 'We can work on analyzing it as soon as we get back.')
('Maxim', 'J-Just what ARE you...?')
('Van', "We'll keep quiet about your business, so we'd sure<br/>appreciate it if you keep quiet about ours.")
('Van', "Anyway, there's nothin' in the way now, so how about<br/>we get to treasure hunting?")
('Maxim', "Right! I'll get right on that!")
('Maxim', "This isn't it... Not here, either...")
('Maxim', 'Here it is! Found it!')
('Aaron', 'Oh, hey.')
('Quatre', 'It looks to have been made of a<br/>corrosion-resistant alloy.')
('Feri', "There's Maxim's name, too.")
('Agnès', 'Hmm? But then the one below it...')
('Van', '...')
('Maxim', "I've finally found it. Wow. I look so young in<br/>this picture.")
('Maxim', 'And there she is right with me... Haha. I could never<br/>forget her face.')
('Agnès', 'Umm...')
('Feri', 'Erm... Th-That has to be...')
('Aaron', "You've gotta be kidding me.")
('Maxim', 'Wh-What? What is it? Why are you all reacting<br/>like that?')
('Quatre', 'What are the odds of this...?')
('Risette', "But everything we've been told about the woman in<br/>question does match.")
('Van', "Yeah—even down to Yumes' age.")
('Maxim', "Wait... You don't all happen to know Paulette,<br/>do you?")
('Maxim', "D-Don't just go silent on me!<br/>Say something!")
('System', "Van's group decided to take a short break.")
('System', 'Everyone split up so they could spend their free time<br/>as they pleased.')
('Nina', 'This is the real me.')
('Nina', "The one you don't know—the one I don't want you<br/>to know.")
('Nina', 'But I...')
('Nina', "No, this isn't right. I'm missing something.")
('Van', 'Hey, there. Thought about taking a break?')
('Nina', 'Mr. Arkride! What are you doing here?')
('Van', 'Your director sent me.')
('Nina', 'Ahaha... I guess they were both really worried<br/>about me.')
('Nina', 'We recently filmed one of the most important scenes<br/>in my next film, you see.')
('Nina', 'The director said my final cut was fine, so we were<br/>ready to move on...')
('Nina', "...but I'm still not happy with it. I still feel like I can<br/>do better, so I asked him to let me shoot again after I<br/>rehearsed it some more.")
('Van', "And that's why you're here, all alone.")
('Van', "It sounded like a long monologue. Surprised it's givin'<br/>you so much trouble.")
('Nina', "I think it's because I've been rehearsing it alone.<br/>I'm meant to look at someone during the actual<br/>scene, and it's hard when I don't have anyone.")
('Nina', 'Oh, I know! Would you be willing to act as my<br/>partner while I practice?')
('Van', "Me? Didn't see that one comin'. But I know that<br/>even if I said no, you ain't leavin' till it's perfect...")
('Van', "But are you sure you wanna ask me? I ain't exactly an<br/>experienced actor.")
('Nina', "That's all right! Just you being here will make a world<br/>of difference.")
('Van', 'All right. I got the time to spare, so give it your<br/>best shot.')
('Van', "Just don't go expectin' nothin' a sack of flour couldn't<br/>do better.")
('Nina', 'Heehee, thank you!')
('System', 'With Van as her partner, Nina continued practicing<br/>the problematic scene over and over.')
('System', "But, in the end, she still wasn't able to come up with a<br/>take she was happy with.")
('Nina', '*pant* *cough*')
('Van', "How 'bout that break?")
('Van', "This is your job and all, but you're gonna burn<br/>yourself out if you keep at it nonstop.")
('Nina', "I'm so sorry. It feels like I've just been wasting your<br/>time here.")
('Nina', "I should've known I couldn't handle this like<br/>Judith does...")
('Van', "What's she got to do with this? You guys're very<br/>different kinds of actresses, yeah?")
('Nina', "People always talk about how I embody the characters<br/>I act so naturally, it's like I'm possessed by them.")
('Nina', 'You might be able to put a positive spin on it, but<br/>what those words mean at the end of the day is that<br/>my acting has no real soul of its own.')
('Van', "That's a bit harsh.")
('Nina', "But it's the truth.")
('Nina', "Judith's acting is just so full of heart and soul.")
('Nina', "Every one of her roles has an identity that's<br/>uniquely hers.")
('Nina', "Not to say that she's not doing a good job portraying<br/>the role, of course. I don't mean that.")
('Nina', "She maintains the role's integrity, but she always puts<br/>part of her into it. She takes to every role in a way<br/>that's uniquely hers.")
('Nina', "That's her greatest appeal as an actress, if you ask me.")
('Van', 'I see it, yeah.')
('Nina', "But I just...can't do that.")
('Nina', "I don't have her strength of spirit—and I never will,<br/>because I'm empty. All I can do is act the role<br/>I'm given.")
('Nina', "That's...all I can ever do.")
('Van', "'She's extremely transparent while acting. So much so<br/>that you might see right through her—and her<br/>hollow acting.'")
('Van', "I remember readin' that on a magazine after your<br/>debut film aired.")
('Nina', 'You have a good memory.')
('Van', "You know that just 'cause someone said that doesn't<br/>mean it's true, right?")
('Van', "If that's how people see you, then that's a talent you<br/>should take in stride.")
('Nina', 'But...')
('Nina', "...You can call my acting skills whatever you want, but<br/>the truth is I'll never measure up to Judith.")
('Van', "And that might be your problem right there. If you<br/>really think there's nothin' in there, then that's all the<br/>more space to start fillin' in.")
('Van', "There's still plenty of time for you to create the<br/>identity you think you're lacking.")
('Van', 'You got a lotta material to take inspiration from.')
('Nina', 'What do you mean?')
('Van', "You're well known for not just takin' a script and<br/>listening to it to a T. You always take it a step further.")
('Van', 'You wrap yourself in the role and let it become who<br/>you are. You think and act like the characters would.')
('Van', "That's not somethin' you just up and forget.")
('Van', "Or do their lives and experiences just vanish from<br/>your head after you stop playin' the role?")
('Nina', 'I...')
('Nina', "No, they don't. I remember everything.")
('Nina', "I remember the warmth of being in Ron's arms as<br/>Michelle in Wolves' Requiem.")
('Nina', 'I still remember how reassuring it was to have my<br/>friends and companions at my side in Gloria as<br/>Sheena Dirke.')
('Van', 'Yeah, thought so. You remember all of that so clearly.')
('Van', "And that's not somethin' just everyone can do.<br/>Not even Judith. Those voices—those feelings are just<br/>as much a part of you. You ain't empty.")
('Van', "But don't let them overwhelm you, either. You gotta<br/>listen to what you want, too.")
('Van', "And I might get shit for sayin' this, but to hell with<br/>the script. I think this should be more important<br/>to you.")
('Van', "'Cause it's somethin' that only you can do.")
('Nina', '...')
('Nina', "Heehee. I'd never even considered disregarding<br/>my lines.")
('Nina', 'That... That might actually be a good idea!')
('Nina', 'Do you mind if I try the scene one more time?<br/>I might finally have something.')
('Nina', "And let's start from the very beginning this time!")
('Van', 'Yeah, sure—wait. Already?!')
('System', 'And so they resumed their acting.')
('System', 'Nina performed the scene over and over, Van still<br/>acting as her partner.')
('System', 'Every attempt refined the scene further, and Nina<br/>could feel the pleasant and satisfying exhaustion wash<br/>over her.')
('System', 'Eventually...')
('Nina', "This is the real me. The one you don't know—the<br/>one I don't want you to know.")
('Nina', "But I...I can't run anymore. Not if I'm going to stay<br/>true to myself!")
('Van', '...!')
('Director Lam', 'Cuuuuuut!')
('Nina', 'M-Mr. Lam?')
('Van', "How long have y'all been there? Wait, were you<br/>filming this?")
('Director Lam', "Haha. Don't worry, we were only filming Nina.")
('Director Lam', 'That was spectacular, Nina. I know I approved our<br/>previous take, but this was significantly better.')
('Director Lam', "You went off script a little, but that doesn't matter<br/>when I could feel you and your character's soul so<br/>perfectly in your delivery.")
('Nina', 'Th-Thank you, Director!')
('Director Lam', "All right, everyone! Let's keep this momentum and<br/>get back to shooting!")
(40301, 'Of course!')
('Van', "Glad that's taken care of.")
('Nina', "Same. It's a relief. It feels like I finally saw a side of<br/>myself I'd never faced before.")
('Nina', 'Thank you so, so much for your help!')
('System', 'They parted ways, Van leaving Nina and her crew to<br/>their filming.')
('Mare', 'Well then, Van? Will you bear the nightmare?<br/>Or not?')
('Van', 'I will.')
('Van', "I'll bear it.")
('Van', 'These fragile chains guide me to this realm, where I<br/>am now made manifest.')
('Van', 'I am both the nightmare, and the beast that<br/>devours it!')
('System', 'A fearsome foe is prowling around.')
('System', 'Found <br/>.')
('System', 'Found <br/>.')
('System', 'Quest Pest Control at the Park completed!')
('System', 'Received')
('Raymond', 'I finally found you, Jess.')
('Van', 'This is where you were, huh.')
('Jess', 'Raymond? Van?')
('Jess', "Oh, I see. You must've asked for his help finding me.")
('Jess', "Haha, you're really good at tracking people down,<br/>aren't you?")
('Van', "Sorry, but work's work.")
('Van', 'Should we leave you guys to it?')
('Raymond', 'Actually, could you stay here?')
('Raymond', "I have a feeling that Jess is just gonna dodge my<br/>questions if it's just us two here.")
('Jess', '...')
('Van', "All right. If that's what the client wants, that's what<br/>the client gets.")
('Raymond', "I'll get right to the point, then.")
('Raymond', 'Why did you do this, Jess? Why would you just<br/>disappear all of a sudden, only leaving us a note?')
('Raymond', "Did you never think that might've been cruel?")
('Jess', '...')
('Jess', "Yeah, you're right. I'm sorry.")
('Jess', "But I didn't know what else to do. I'm such<br/>a coward...")
('Raymond', 'Jess...')
('Raymond', 'If this is because of Carol—')
('Jess', "It's not. Not at all.")
('Jess', 'I do feel bad not being able to return her<br/>feelings, yeah.')
('Jess', "But that's not why I ran away.")
('Raymond', 'Then why did you?')
('Jess', 'You still remember that conversation we had before<br/>coming to Edith? Just the two of us.')
('Raymond', 'Of course I do remember it. And how we promised to<br/>keep it a secret.')
('Van', "Ya sure it's okay for us to be here?")
('Raymond', "It's fine on my end, at least.")
('Raymond', 'What about you, Jess? Are you okay if we talk about<br/>it now?')
('Jess', "Sure. It's not that big a deal anyway.")
('Jess', "We just talked about us both being in love with<br/>someone who didn't reciprocate our feelings.")
('Raymond', 'Yeah.')
('Raymond', "Your feelings haven't changed, I take it?")
('Jess', 'They have not, no.')
('Jess', "And I'll never be with the one I love. That, I can<br/>guarantee you.")
('Jess', "That's because...")
('Jess', 'Actually, never mind me. This is wrong. Me putting<br/>things to words will only make it worse.')
('Jess', "No one's gonna benefit from it if I say it out loud.<br/>It would just be a hassle for you anyway.")
('Raymond', 'What does that mean—')
('Raymond', 'Wait...')
('Van', '(I think he finally figured it out.)')
('Agnès', '(It looks like it.)')
('Feri', "(I... I think I'm lost here.)")
('Aaron', '(Heh. Figures.)')
('Risette', '(I suspected as much.)')
('Quatre', '(Oh. I see now.)')
('Judith', '(Huh. Who knew?)')
('Bergard', '(Hmm. I see.)')
('Jess', "I don't intend on acting on my feelings, so you don't<br/>have to worry about that.")
('Jess', 'But...you gotta understand how I feel now.')
('Jess', "Especially since you also can't be together with the<br/>one you love.")
('Raymond', "...That's fair.")
('Raymond', "Yeah. You're right about that...")
('Van', "(Didn't see that one comin'.)")
('Agnès', '(Raymond...)')
('Feri', '...?')
('Aaron', '(Life can be such a pain in the ass sometimes.)')
('Risette', '(How tragic.)')
('Quatre', '(I feel really bad for them.)')
('Judith', '(Love can be so easy and so complicated at the<br/>same time.)')
('Bergard', "(Life's always a difficult thing.)")
('Jess', "I can't stand the thought of ruining things between<br/>the three of us.")
('Jess', 'You must feel the same way, right?')
('Jess', "But Carol didn't.")
('Raymond', 'Carol...')
('Jess', 'She said something to me three nights ago that really<br/>caught me off guard.')
('Jess', 'Said that she knew how I felt.')
('Jess', "That was it, really. I know it doesn't feel like a big<br/>deal, but it was to me. And I know she didn't mean to<br/>hurt me, either...")
('Jess', "...but I just couldn't. I couldn't bear it anymore.")
('Jess', "That's why I ran.")
('Raymond', 'Jess...')
('Jess', 'So you understand now.')
('Jess', "You understand why we can't be together anymore.")
('Carol', 'Wait!')
('Jess', 'Carol?')
('Raymond', 'You came.')
('Van', "Was wonderin' when you'd show up.")
('Carol', "I wasn't sure if I even wanted to come, but I've made<br/>up my mind. I couldn't just keep ignoring it.")
('Carol', 'I really appreciate you taking the blame for me, Jess.')
('Carol', 'But you should stop that. This is all my fault.')
('Carol', 'I knew how you felt, and I still decided to talk to you<br/>about all this.')
('Jess', "It's okay, Carol. It's not really your fault here.")
('Jess', "If anything, I'm grateful.")
('Jess', "This was going to happen one day. I knew that<br/>all along. It's always been an inevitability.")
('Jess', "You didn't cause this, but only hurried it along.<br/>It's probably better for us to deal with this now,<br/>rather than kick it down the road any further.")
('Jess', 'Right?')
('Carol', 'Jess...')
('Raymond', "That's not...")
('Jess', "I'm really sorry for leaving without saying anything.")
('Jess', 'But we had the chance to talk now. You understand<br/>why it just had to be done.')
('Jess', 'So...this is goodbye.')
('Carol', '...')
('Van', "(I don't like havin' things end here.)")
('Van', "(Should probably say somethin'. How about...)")
('Van', "Y'all are really gonna regret this, y'know.")
('Carol', '...')
('Raymond', 'Van...')
('Jess', '...')
('Jess', 'I know that. I already do.')
('Jess', "But it's probably better this way. For the sake of all of<br/>us—")
('Van', 'You sure about that?')
('Van', 'You guys have known each other since you were kids.')
('Van', "I'm guessin' you don't wanna leave so much as you<br/>want them to understand what you're goin' through.<br/>And to stick together.")
('Jess', 'I...')
('Raymond', "H-He's right! That's what I want, at least.")
('Raymond', 'This is still a lot to take in, to be honest.')
('Raymond', 'But neither you nor your feelings are a hassle to<br/>me, Jess.')
('Raymond', 'I swear it.')
('Raymond', "Goddess, why would you even think that? I promise<br/>you they're not, and that should be one of your<br/>biggest worries taken care of, yeah?")
('Jess', "But that's...")
('Carol', "I-I know I really don't have a right to speak here since<br/>I caused this in the first place...")
('Carol', "But you're still the same Jess we've always known.<br/>Us knowing how you feel doesn't change that.")
('Carol', "It doesn't change who you are, or how we feel<br/>about you.")
('Jess', 'You... You really mean that?')
('Van', "Looks like you should've put a lot more faith in your<br/>friends there. They're pretty understanding.")
('Van', "You still think runnin' away's the best choice?")
('Van', "If you were only hurting yourself then it'd be<br/>one thing.")
('Van', "But that ain't the case, is it? Your actions are gonna<br/>cause the friends you care so much about pain, too.<br/>They're also gonna regret this.")
('Jess', 'I...')
('Van', 'At the very least, you three need to sit down and have<br/>a good and long talk about what you want.')
('Van', "If after all that you still want to walk away, then<br/>that's fine. It's never too late.")
('Van', 'Heh. And here I thought you three were such<br/>good friends.')
('Van', 'But it was all for show, huh.')
('Jess', '...What?')
('Raymond', 'V-Van...')
('Carol', 'What do you mean?')
('Van', 'Exactly what I said.')
('Van', "You care about them, yeah. I'll give you that.")
('Van', "It might even be what led you to takin' the unilateral<br/>choice to walk away, thinkin' it would be what's for<br/>the best.")
('Van', "But what it really looks like to me is that you're tryin'<br/>to take the easy way out.")
('Jess', "I-I'm not...")
('Van', 'And you two are no different.')
('Van', "You think treatin' him with kiddy gloves is gonna<br/>help shit? I get you're tryin' to be considerate, but<br/>hell, it's your friendship on the line.")
('Van', "If you really cared, you'd do everything in your power<br/>to stop him from leavin'.")
('Jess', '...!')
('Jess', "Stop that! You can say anything you want to me, but I<br/>won't let you talk to Carol and Raymond like that!")
('Jess', "I'm the one that messed up here!")
('Van', "*sigh* Are you even listenin'? You—")
('Raymond', "It's okay, Van. You brought me back to my senses.")
('Carol', 'What do you mean?')
('Raymond', "I'm still processing all of this, to be honest.")
('Raymond', "But if there's one thing I'm sure of, it's that what<br/>you're doing is wrong, Jess.")
('Raymond', "Our relationship is not so shallow. Our friendship is<br/>real, and it's worth fighting for.")
('Jess', 'Raymond...')
('Raymond', "Did you really think I'd be uncomfortable around you<br/>if I knew how you felt?")
('Raymond', "If you did, then you don't really know me as well as<br/>you thought.")
('Raymond', 'You feel the same way, right, Carol?')
('Carol', "I-I know I really don't have a right to speak here since<br/>I caused this in the first place...")
('Carol', "But you're still the same Jess we've always known.<br/>Us knowing how you feel doesn't change that.")
('Carol', "It doesn't change who you are, or how we feel<br/>about you.")
('Jess', 'I... I...')
('Van', "Now that's more like it.")
('Van', 'At the very least, you three need to sit down and have<br/>a good and long talk about what you want.')
('Van', "If after all that you still want to walk away, then<br/>that's fine. It's never too late.")
('Raymond', "Van's right.")
('Carol', 'Please, Jess.')
('Jess', 'You two are far kinder to me than I deserve.')
('Jess', "But if you're willing to fight for us so much, then it<br/>wouldn't do it if I just took the coward's way<br/>out, yeah?")
('Jess', 'I need to be brave and face the consequences for this,<br/>whatever those may be.')
('Van', 'Glad to hear it.')
('Carol', 'Thank you, Jess.')
('Raymond', "I knew you'd come around.")
('Agnès', "I'm so glad everything worked out between them.")
('Feri', "Thing's should be A-OK now!")
('Aaron', "And that's a wrap.")
('Risette', "It's pleasant to see things worked out in the end.")
('Quatre', "That's settled, then. For now, at least.")
('Judith', 'I think that was the best outcome for everyone.')
('Bergard', 'Going through strife oftentimes helps strengthen<br/>a relationship.')
('Raymond', 'We owe you, Van.')
('Jess', 'What you said really resonated with me.')
('Van', 'Heh. Good to know.')
('Raymond', 'We owe you one, Van.')
('Jess', "Though I didn't expect you to be so harsh, haha.")
('Van', "Sometimes a little shock therapy's what's needed.")
('Jess', "I'll never forget what you did for us today.")
('Jess', "Let me be the one that pays your fee. It's only right,<br/>since I caused this.")
