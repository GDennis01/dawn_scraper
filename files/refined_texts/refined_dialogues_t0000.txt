('Motona', 'It was my family that first imported buckwheat flour<br/>to the village, in fact.')
('Motona', "So I dare say it's in my blood!")
('Agnès', 'So, how do you make buckwheat dough?')
('Motona', 'There are two main ways you can do it.')
('Motona', "The simpler way is to just use only buckwheat flour—<br/>that's called 100% dough.")
('Motona', 'The second is to mix buckwheat flour with standard<br/>wheat flour.')
('Motona', 'You can play around with the ratio of buckwheat to<br/>wheat, and that can change the dough<br/>pretty significantly.')
('Motona', "The most common ratio is 80% dough—that's 80%<br/>buckwheat, 20% wheat.")
('Feri', "So the way you make the dough isn't always<br/>the same... There's more to this than I thought!")
('Motona', 'The more buckwheat you have in the dough, the<br/>easier it dries out.')
('Motona', "So working with higher buckwheat ratios takes more<br/>skill, especially when you're kneading it.")
('Motona', "That's about the gist of it!")
('Van', 'Huh. Lot more complicated than I gave it credit for.')
('Van', 'Thanks for the crash course.')
('Motona', 'My pleasure. Give my regards to Giovanna,<br/>would you?')
('Van', 'Okay, that should be good enough.')
('Agnès', 'I think we have a good grasp on the subject now!')
('Feri', "So do we go back to Giovanna's now?")
('Van', "Hmm... Actually, y'know, I think we're still<br/>missin' something.")
('Agnès', 'Oh? And what would that something be?')
('Van', "A secret spice, that's what.")
('Van', "Nothin' wrong with stickin' to the basics, but I say if<br/>we're makin' our own, we put a little spin on it.<br/>Somethin' off the beaten path, y'know?")
('Van', "Maybe somethin' that grows around here...<br/>How about local plants? We could probably find<br/>some stuff down by the creek.")
('Feri', "I'm...not sure what you mean, but you sound really<br/>confident about it. I trust you on this one!")
('Van', "Cool. If we don't find anything, no biggie.")
('Van', "Let's give it a crack and see what we come up with.")
('Agnès', 'Right!')
('Motona', "Ranji's a real worrywart sometimes... Personally, I<br/>think we should trust Kaina's judgment.")
('Motona', "Our little girl is growing up. If she wants to leave the<br/>nest already, that's her choice.")
('Motona', 'I think going out and seeing what the world has to<br/>offer will do wonders for her.')
('Motona', "Of course, I'm still worried about her.")
('Motona', "And I do wish she didn't spring this on us<br/>so suddenly...")
('Motona', 'We want to be able to support our daughter,<br/>wherever she goes.')
('Motona', "And I do agree with my husband: I hope she doesn't<br/>lose sight of the smaller things in her pursuit of a<br/>professional career.")
('Motona', "But again, she's at that age where she can start<br/>making decisions for herself. I'm sure she's thought<br/>this through.")
('Motona', "I'll just need to have faith in her.")
('Motona', "Giovanna told me that she made a good soba!<br/>I'm glad my advice helped.")
('Motona', "I'm curious how the soba came out—depending on<br/>how she used my buckwheat, the flavor profile can<br/>change dramatically.")
('Motona', 'I should ask her for a taste!')
('Motona', 'There are many different kinds of buckwheat<br/>dough—the flavor and texture vary based on the ratio<br/>of buckwheat to normal wheat flour.')
('Motona', '100% dough, true to its name, uses buckwheat<br/>flour only.')
('Motona', "80% dough is also popular—that's 80% buckwheat,<br/>20% wheat.")
('Motona', 'Neither is strictly better, per se—it comes down to<br/>personal preference. But I hope that helps point you<br/>in the right direction!')
('Motona', 'How did you find our galettes?')
('Motona', 'Not a lot of people know that their unique taste<br/>comes from the traditionally Eastern flour we use.')
('Motona', 'From what I hear, my family imported buckwheat<br/>flour to the village from the East.')
('Motona', 'My husband and I manage the buckwheat mill<br/>here in Creil.')
('Motona', "I don't do so for tradition's sake, though—more than<br/>anything, I'm just happy to contribute to our<br/>village's specialty!")
('Gonzales', "Annie's a shrinkin' violet, I tell ya, but she really puts<br/>a smile on my face.")

('Gonzales', "That was the happiest I've felt all year, gahaha!<br/>Love her to death, the kid.")
('Gonzales', "Y'can imagine my wife's pretty headstrong, herself.<br/>Takes a stubborn one to put up with me!")
('Gonzales', "Kent took after us, for sure. Kid's always gettin' his<br/>nose in stuff.")
('Gonzales', "But Annie, my sweet li'l angel, she's just perfect.<br/>Where'd she get that from, I wonder...?")
('Gonzales', "Phew! 'Nother day of farmin' done—I worked up a<br/>good sweat. Time to kick back with a cold one!")
('Gonzales', "...Eh, y'know, maybe not. Wife doesn't like me doin'<br/>that too much... She scares the hell outta me when<br/>she's mad.")
('Gonzales', "Feel like I wouldn't be settin' the right example for<br/>Annie, either. Can't bear to think of her hatin' me...<br/>Makes me wanna cry!")
('Gonzales', "Giovanna's been messin' with some kinda<br/>recipe lately. What was it, uhh...")
('Gonzales', "Soba noodles? That sounds kinda right. Ah, whatever<br/>it is, I'm sure it'll be delicious!")
('Gonzales', "Oh, yeah! Giovanna made those soba noodles she was<br/>talkin' about.")
('Gonzales', "I knew she'd been worried about 'em for a while.<br/>Glad they came out right!")
('Gonzales', "Better get my butt home so I can give 'em a try!")
('Gonzales', 'Awright, time to wrap this up!')
('Gonzales', "Come to think of it, I saw Kent and Annie playin'<br/>down by the river today.")
('Gonzales', "Now, Kent's unstoppable, I tell ya. Annie, though?<br/>She's nothin' like him!")
('Gonzales', "I love 'em both to death, of course—just funny to see<br/>how different they ended up!")
('Giovanna', 'Now, Kent, give him some space, okay?')
('Giovanna', "Lashkar's really come into his own—I see a dependable<br/>young man in his future.")
('Giovanna', "He's been talking about how he wants to be a bracer<br/>when he grows up. I bet he'd get along well<br/>with Annie! She's a smart cookie herself.")
('Giovanna', 'Annie is a bit apprehensive... I think she gets that<br/>from me. But Kent is her polar opposite—I have no<br/>idea who he takes after!')
('Giovanna', '...Well, I do have an idea, being honest, but Gonzales<br/>is still a good man. I understand Kent looking up<br/>to him.')
('Giovanna', "So far, we've had a great harvest. I think this year's<br/>festival will be plenty grand to go with it.")
('Giovanna', "And thanks to you, I have a special dish I can bring to<br/>the feast. I'm sure it'll be a festival to<br/>remember, heehee!")
('Giovanna', "Oh, if you're interested, you don't have to be a villager<br/>to enjoy the festival. If you have the time, we'd be<br/>happy to see you.")
('Giovanna', 'Say, has anyone ever told you about our harvest<br/>festival?')
('Giovanna', "The year before last, we had to put the festival on<br/>hold due to the war... But as of last autumn, we're<br/>back on schedule.")
('Giovanna', "We had a good harvest this year, so we really want to<br/>make this festival count. We're planning a feast for<br/>everyone in the village!")
('Giovanna', "Anyone and everyone is welcome—if you have the<br/>time, we'd love to see you there!")
('Giovanna', 'I did tell Motona and Gonzales about the soba.')
('Giovanna', "I still have plenty of leftovers, so they're welcome to a<br/>taste, too.")
('Giovanna', "With practice, I'm sure I'll make some wonderful<br/>noodles in time for the festival!")
('Giovanna', "If you wouldn't mind checking with Motona and<br/>Mayor Weng for me, I'd appreciate it.")
('Giovanna', "I'll finish the rest of my housework while you're out.")
('Giovanna', "Ah! Hello there. Are you travelers? I didn't see you<br/>among those bus riders.")
('Giovanna', "We're not the busiest town in the world, but I hope<br/>you enjoy your time here, nonetheless. Just relax and<br/>unwind—it's what our village does best.")
('Giovanna', "Oh, and if you get the chance, try some vegetables<br/>from Martha's shop! They're like our village's<br/>hidden gems.")
('Giovanna', 'She carries the pumpkins we grow, too.')
('Giovanna', "Galettes, of course, are our specialty, but they're not<br/>all we make. We have a bountiful range of crops here.")
('Giovanna', 'My husband can grow pumpkins with the very best<br/>of them. He hides a real green thumb beneath that,<br/>er...boorish exterior.')
('Annie', "I can always count on Lashkar, heehee. I'm excited to<br/>go to the capital with him!")
('Annie', "But...I wonder why he won't play with me and<br/>Kent anymore.")
('Annie', 'I come to the square to walk Nero a lot.')
('Annie', "Nero might have gone somewhere he knows from<br/>our walks... I'll look for him around here. Let's split<br/>up, okay?")
('Annie', 'Please help me find him...!')
('Annie', "I'm sorry I'm so annoying with this, Lashkar...")
('Lashkar', "Hey, don't sweat it! You're my friend.")
('Annie', "Nero looks kinda stressed out, so I'm gonna bring<br/>him home.")
('Annie', 'Kent just has so much energy. We have to drag him<br/>back inside whenever we play!')
('Annie', 'Thank you so much for helping me find Nero, Lashkar!')
('Lashkar', "No problem... I-I mean, of course! It's all in a day's<br/>work for a bracer trainee!")
('Lashkar', "I'm just glad Nero's okay. I don't like seeing you sad.<br/>It...makes me sad, too.")
('Annie', "Aww, heehee. Thanks, Lashkar. I know you'll be a<br/>bracer some day—you're so kind and strong!")
('Lashkar', 'I, uh... Wow, thanks! Now I wanna be a bracer<br/>even more!')
('Lashkar', 'O-Oh, umm... Just wanted to ask. Do you wanna,<br/>maybe...go to the capital some time? Together,<br/>I mean?')
('Lashkar', 'I-I mean, I just wanna see the main guild<br/>branch there! You can tag along and we can, uh...<br/>t-tour around?')
('Annie', "Well, if you'd let me, then...yeah!")
('Annie', "I bet it'll be really fun seeing the capital together!")
('Annie', "Come on, Kent. Let's go home, okay? I think<br/>Nero's anxious... Maybe he wants to sleep.")
('Kent', 'Aww, I wanna stay outside! There are so many new<br/>people to play with!')
('Kent', "Ooh, ooh! Annie, there's a crab!")
('Annie', 'You get way too excited, Kent...')
('Annie', 'Something about that old man really scared me...<br/>I wonder what he was doing all the way out here in<br/>the village?')
('Kent', 'Lashkar wanted to play, too...')
('Kent', '...but Mommy said not right now.')
('Kent', "I don't get it... Can we play with him<br/>tomorrow, then?")
('Kent', "Oh, no... Where's Nero gone? I don't see<br/>him anywhere...")
('Kent', 'I hope we find him before sundown...')
('Kent', "Hi there, mister crab. You don't mind if I catch<br/>you, right?")
('Kent', 'Ooh, I bet Annie and Nero will flip when I<br/>show them!')
('Kent', "It's okay, Annie...")
('Kent', "I know Lashkar will find him! He's gotta!")
('Annie', 'I know, I just...')
('Feri', "(Sounds like they've got trouble on their hands.)")
('Van', "(I feel for 'em, but we don't have the time to spare.<br/>We need to sort out our own business first.)")
('Agnès', "(Let's see if we can help them after we're done.)")
('Annie', "Oh, Nero, I'm so glad you're safe...!")
('Annie', "But when did you get so muddy? I'm gonna have to<br/>give you a good bath!")
('Lashkar', "Sounds good! I'll keep an eye on Kent while you<br/>clean him.")
('Lashkar', 'Hey, Kent! You up for some late-night hide and seek?')
('Kent', "You bet! I won't lose this time!")
('Annie', 'Thanks, Lashkar.')
('Nero', 'Mrrow!')
('Kent', 'Heehee, he wants to play, too!')
('Kent', "All right, I'll play with you for a bit. But don't make<br/>Annie worry like that again, okay?")
('Nero', 'Meowr!')
('Nero', 'Mrrow?')
('Nero', 'Meow!')
('Nero', 'Mrr...')
('Annie', "Hmm? What's wrong, Nero? Usually you're running<br/>around a lot more...")
('Nero', 'Rawrm...')
('Jafar', 'My children are rightly proud of their home—my<br/>daughter most of all!')
('Jafar', "She wears the cloth well, for certain. Brings a tear to<br/>her old man's eye!")
('Jafar', 'Now, my son? Call it conjecture, but I see the stars in<br/>his future!')
('Jafar', "...Phew. I'm starting to sound like that old friend of<br/>mine, fawning over his own kids for moons on end.")
('Jafar', "Perhaps that's just what us old codgers like to do: live<br/>vicariously through our children and punish any poor<br/>soul who lends an ear.")
('Jafar', 'Have you been to the chapel, yourself? The sister<br/>there is none other than my daughter!')
('Jafar', 'She brought me to tears when she left our home for<br/>the Holy City...and then to tears of joy when<br/>she returned!')
('Jafar', "Oh, how she's grown so...! *sniffle* She just warms<br/>my heart.")
('Jafar', "Goodness, I need to pull myself together. I can't go<br/>crying in front of new acquaintances!")
('Jafar', "Well, at least I won't have to worry about crying at<br/>her wedding. She's a woman of the cloth, haha!")
('Jafar', 'She really makes her papa proud!')
('Jafar', 'Curious about the windmill, are you?')
('Jafar', 'This here is my prized grain thresher. It does its job<br/>plenty well!')
('Jafar', "Veggies and galettes are well and good, but they say<br/>'bread and butter' for a reason.")
('Jafar', "We're part of the Republic's breadbasket with the<br/>wheat we produce.")
('Jafar', 'And though crops of any kind are a welcome sight,<br/>wheat especially just feels...gratifying.')
('Jafar', "Gazing out upon that sea of golden grains, picturing<br/>the wonderful loaves they'll make... It just makes your<br/>heart soar! Or, it does mine, at least.")
('Jafar', "And you can't make beer without the right grains,<br/>after all! Haha!")
('Lashkar', '(Phew... Man, why am I getting so nervous<br/>over this?!)')
('Lashkar', "(I gotta make sure I'm worthy of her—and that<br/>means becoming a strong bracer she can rely on!<br/>I'm sure of it!)")
('Lashkar', "(Knowing is half the battle, and I think I've got it all<br/>figured out!)")
('Lashkar', "Oh, yeah. Wasn't there a bracer who came out here<br/>from the capital?")
('Lashkar', 'I wanted to ask about the main branch and stuff, but I<br/>guess I have to wait until things settle down here.')
('Lashkar', "I get it, though. They have bigger things to deal<br/>with—and I'm not a kid anymore, so I don't need<br/>adults following me around.")
('Lashkar', '*sigh* I really made a mess of this...')
('Lashkar', "I'm sorry... Can I ask you to catch Nero for me?")
('Van', "Don't worry, bud. You just leave it to us. We'll<br/>get him.")
('Lashkar', "I could've really wowed Annie if I caught<br/>him myself...")
('Lashkar', 'I guess I still have a long way to go before I can call<br/>myself a bracer...')
('Lashkar', "Why do I wanna be a bracer? Well...it's more than<br/>just being a big, strong hero for me.")
('Lashkar', "There's someone I like that I wanna protect—<br/>someone who's...really cheery, but kinda shy.<br/>It's really cute, and...")
('Lashkar', "...Wait, no! That's not—I—you heard nothing!")
('Lashkar', "I-I mean, I like the whole village, and I wanna<br/>protect it! She's j-just part of it, y'know?!")
('Lashkar', 'But then, whenever I ask what it means to be strong,<br/>what it means to protect someone...everybody has a<br/>different answer.')
('Lashkar', 'Sometimes I wonder if becoming a bracer is the right<br/>thing to do...')
('Lashkar', "It's just, I feel nervous whenever I question it.")
('Lashkar', 'Oh, uh, mister? You were talking about helping<br/>people out with jobs around the village. Are you<br/>a bracer?')
('Lashkar', 'I wanna be a bracer, too!')
('Van', 'Huh. I give off that vibe?')
('Van', 'Good to know I can pull that off.')
('Lashkar', "Wait, so you're not?")
('Lashkar', "...Actually, yeah, on second thought, you'd be kinda<br/>cold and creepy for a bracer.")
('Lashkar', 'Here I was thinking I could ask you about the main<br/>guild branch at the capital...')
('Van', 'Well, I work in the capital, and I do poke my head in<br/>there for work sometimes.')
('Van', "Why, you thinkin' about visiting?")
('Lashkar', 'I... Yeah! I am!')
('Lashkar', "I don't wanna just talk the talk. I wanna go learn<br/>about the guild and how to join it! The sooner,<br/>the better!")
('Lashkar', 'Do you know anything about how to join?')
('Van', "Well, far as I know, they don't really do tours or<br/>tryout days or that kinda stuff...")
('Van', "You just walk in and say, 'Hey, I wanna be a bracer!',<br/>and if they got room, they'll train you.")
('Van', "Hell, you could probably walk in right now, long as<br/>they're not too busy.")
('Lashkar', "Really? I'd better hurry, then—I don't wanna<br/>miss out!")
('Lashkar', 'Thanks, mister! I wanna visit as soon as I can!')
('Lashkar', "Man, Annie's really mature for her age.")
('Lashkar', "It's the way she's always looking after her brother,<br/>you know? That kid's a handful, but she keeps him<br/>in check.")
('Lashkar', "People say she's 'soft' and stuff, but I think she's<br/>just humble. She's really strong when she wants to be.")
('Lashkar', "I wanna grow up to be strong, too. For her—I mean,<br/>everyone's sake!")
('Martha', 'Ah! You caught me just as I was closing. Is there<br/>something you need?')
('Martha', 'You can be my last customer for the day.')
('Martha', "Heehee... I'm willing to bet most big city shops would<br/>just boot you out. They're all business and no<br/>personality, aren't they?")
('Martha', "I'm in no rush. Take what time you need.")
('Martha', "I don't have much to do back home, so there's<br/>nothing waiting on me.")
('Martha', "It's been some time since my husband passed on...but<br/>I'm still kicking, selling the vegetables he used to<br/>grow with his old friends.")
('Martha', "It keeps him in my mind, this shop and these veggies,<br/>even if he's not with me anymore.")
('Martha', 'And the village gets a kick out of my little<br/>handicrafts, too.')
('Martha', "It's not a bad way to spend my twilight years.")
('Martha', 'Hello there. How may I help you?')
('Martha', "Our veggies are still good in the city, of course, just<br/>not as fresh. They're their best when you buy them<br/>here, straight from the farm.")
('Martha', "I sell produce direct from the farmers, so you're<br/>getting the freshest possible veggies.")
('Martha', "Oh, and just so you're aware, I have a few<br/>sweets in stock as well.")
('Martha', "I started baking cookies for fun a little while ago.<br/>It's nice to be able to use the village's own produce<br/>for cooking.")
('Focken', "My grandson's always tellin' me that I shouldn't stay<br/>open so late...")
('Focken', '...but sometimes you get good customers at night, like<br/>that beauty who stopped by just a bit ago.')
('Focken', "Besides, I can still run the shop, so what's the harm in<br/>runnin' it late?")
('Focken', "Ain't no one gonna tell ol' Focken how to run his<br/>shop, no sir!")
('Focken', "...That said, it does stretch me a bit thin sometimes.<br/>There's only so much we can do, just the two of us.")
('Focken', 'It was a lot easier back when my son and his wife<br/>were here to split up the workload...')
('Focken', "I just wish my grandson would find himself a<br/>good lady. That'd put me at ease.")
('Focken', "Man, I... Phew. Wasn't expecting I'd struggle to read<br/>my own ledger.")
('Focken', "Father Time's takin' me to task, I reckon.")
('Focken', "I'm just glad I have such a good grandson...")
('Focken', '...Ah. Sorry, I was just lost in thought, there.')
('Focken', "Now, I don't think I've seen you around... Are you a<br/>traveler, or did I just forget your face?")
('Van', "Oh, don't mind us, pops. We're just asking around<br/>about some stuff.")
('Van', 'You remember anything about a group of jaegers who<br/>stopped by a while back?')
('Focken', "Jaegers...? Well, yes, that does ring a bell... Some of<br/>'em came by the shop, I think.")
('Focken', 'That was the week before... Oh, no, never mind, I<br/>think that was someone else.')
('Focken', "Hrm... The more I try to remember, the more foggy<br/>it gets. I don't think I'll be much help, sorry...")
('Van', "Nah, don't sweat it. We'll loop back with you later.")
('Van', "Sometimes it just pops back into your head like<br/>that, y'know?")
('Focken', "I'm sorry, young'un. I'm just too much of an old fogey<br/>to remember things clearly.")
('Focken', "I've been really foggy lately. Sometimes I can<br/>remember if I think on it real hard, but still...")
('Focken', "But I can still work a cash register, eh? Just tell me<br/>what you need and I'll get it for you.")
('Hans', "Oh, what can I get you? We're closing soon, just a<br/>heads up.")
('Hans', "Honestly, I'd really rather my grandpa close the shop<br/>earlier in the day...")
('Hans', "...but he's a stubborn old codger. It's his way or the<br/>highway, and his way is: we're open late.")
('Hans', "Things were smoother when my parents were here...<br/>We gotta jump through hoops a bit when it's just<br/>us two.")
('Hans', "He wants me to settle down with a woman, too, but<br/>really, who's got time?")
('Hans', "Sorry for the mess right now. I'll have this cleaned up<br/>in a sec.")
('Hans', "Grandpa's really gone downhill since we lost<br/>my parents... I can't blame him at all.")
('Hans', 'I wish I could stick close and help him more, but I<br/>have deliveries to make now.')
('Hans', 'Hmm? Hold on... I swear I know you<br/>from somewhere.')
('Hans', 'Have you dropped by our store before? The one right<br/>over there.')
('Van', 'Nope. Never been.')
('Hans', 'Really? Coulda sworn I...')
('Hans', "Oh, wait! You frequent that bistro in Edith's Old<br/>Town, right?")
('Hans', "They source some of their produce from us, and I'm<br/>the delivery guy! Small world, huh?")
('Van', "Oh, yeah! Now that you mention it, I remember<br/>seein' your truck before.")
('Van', 'So the old man gets his veggies from all the way out<br/>here, huh? Quite a hike.')
('Hans', "That it is. I've been working this job for about a<br/>year now.")
('Hans', 'I never got the chance to say hi in Edith, but if we<br/>run into each other again, feel free to chat me up!')
('Hans', "It's always nice to meet customers, clients, and<br/>customers of clients, haha!")
('Hans', "It's tough work, though, not gonna lie. I get now why<br/>my parents prioritized finding a job they loved over a<br/>job that paid.")
('Ben', 'Something seemed off about that jaeger who<br/>dropped by...')
('Ben', "Pretty sure the rest of her group's moved way on by<br/>now, so why'd she take a detour all the way out here?<br/>It just doesn't add up...")
('Ben', "I'm not about to stick my nose in that, though.<br/>You'd best steer clear of her, too, unless you're<br/>looking for trouble.")
('Ben', "I helped serve meals over at the village hall. It's a<br/>relief to see them adjusting well and settling in, in<br/>spite of everything.")
('Ben', "I can't help but feel like we were missing<br/>somebody, though... Somebody big.")
('Ben', "Eh, maybe it's just my mind playing tricks on me.")
('Ben', 'That guy in the shades, he sticks out like a real<br/>sore thumb.')
('Ben', "I can tell he's no average Joe just by the way<br/>he drinks. It's like he has a stranglehold on the room,<br/>even more than the typical jaeger does.")
('Ben', "But, well...I gotta treat him like any other customer,<br/>for now. If he's buying, I'm selling.")
('Ben', 'Guess the bus is stopped here for the night—safety<br/>first, and all that. I can put up some of the passengers<br/>here, at least.')
('Ben', "Every cloud has a silver lining: this impromptu stop<br/>might convince some of them to come back.<br/>That'd be nice, eh?")
('Ben', "And I appreciate having some fresh faces to talk to, at<br/>any rate. It's always nice to make some<br/>new connections.")
('Ben', 'The passengers have made this our busiest night in<br/>weeks, in fact.')
('Ben', "My daughter's really taking it in stride—she hasn't<br/>skipped a beat! Makes me proud to have such a<br/>hard-working kid.")
('Ben', "Thanks for coming. How'd you like the galettes?")
('Ben', "I've got my signature dish on the menu this evening,<br/>so if you're gonna stay the night, drop by here for<br/>dinner, yeah?")
('Ben', "I get this was pretty scary for those passengers...but I<br/>think they'll be able to relax now with their<br/>stomachs full.")
('Ben', "My daughter's been baking galettes practically<br/>every chance she can get lately.")
('Ben', "At this rate, she'll be a better chef than me in no<br/>time. Well, good for her! I'm excited to see how<br/>good she'll get.")
('Ran', "I'm not sure what was up with that woman.<br/>She seemed on edge, for whatever reason.")
('Ran', "I make a point of keeping out of other people's<br/>business, but I couldn't help picking up on her.")
('Ran', "I'm not sure what happened or what she's so worried<br/>about, but, uhh...if you decide to help her out, lemme<br/>know, will you?")
('Ran', "We're just now hitting peak hours, despite all the<br/>commotion earlier in the day.")
('Ran', "Those passengers don't hold a candle to the usual<br/>suspects we get in the evening.")
('Ran', "It's kinda funny. Dad heaps praise on me for holding<br/>down the fort when it's busy, but he doesn't bat an<br/>eye at how well I handle the rowdier regulars.")
('Ran', "I dunno if he just expects that out of me, or if he's<br/>easier on them because they're all his age.")
('Ran', 'Yeeeah, figures the barflies are buzzing tonight.')
('Ran', 'They always rile themselves up whenever something<br/>happens during the day.')
('Ran', "Now, I can still keep a handle on 'em, of course.")
('Ran', 'We had some real colorful customers around this time<br/>last year... For some reason, they stuck out to me.')
('Ran', 'There was a girl who just about wolfed down the<br/>ENTIRE bar. Then there was this blond pretty<br/>boy—the whole place stopped when he walked in.')
('Ran', "I don't think they were related, whoever they were...<br/>but I swear, I saw the guy somewhere before.")
('Ran', 'I recall there was this other bunch, too, a group of<br/>four, and they had not a thing in common.')
('Ran', "I can't imagine how they all got together with so little<br/>common ground...at least, from my point of view.")
('Ran', "We get plenty of those flavorful types around here, so<br/>I guess I've gotten used to it.")
('Ran', "Who knows? Maybe that lady and I would've gotten<br/>along, had I gotten the chance to talk with her.")
('Ran', "Oh, right. If you happen to need some orbment work<br/>done, we can help you out with that. Our workshop's<br/>every bit as good as the big boys!")
('Ran', "The boss has his hands full with the bus, but my<br/>friend works there as his understudy. She's<br/>pretty good!")
('Kim', "I like to think I'm well traveled, but out here, I'm<br/>picking up on a lot of things I never gave much<br/>thought in the city.")
('Kim', 'The farmers swear by fresh produce—they say it does<br/>wonders for your health. I then met an older man<br/>who...could use that advice. Or some supplements.')
('Kim', "It's interesting to hear their takes on healthy living.<br/>Perhaps this was what the bartender meant by<br/>'making connections'?")
('Kim', 'I thought I might be able to bring my market to the<br/>village...but I might end up borrowing from its own<br/>market instead!')
('Kim', 'Fresh vegetables, royal jelly... They have a lot of<br/>things that I could work into my supplements.')
('Kim', "My company's gone all in on Eastern herbal<br/>medicine, and it's really hurting us. This village has<br/>perfectly good ingredients that we're just ignoring.")
('Kim', "I'm headed to Remiferia for a business meeting<br/>regarding nutritional supplements.")
('Kim', 'I was worried this would throw a wrench in things,<br/>but thankfully, I got to make some calls at the inn.<br/>My hosts in Remiferia were very understanding.')
('Kim', 'Sometimes I wish my boss would be like that...<br/>Oh, well.')
('Kim', "At any rate, it looks like this detour isn't all<br/>for naught! Who knows what more I'll find?")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Well, well... You're the last person I thought I'd<br/>bump into on my little errand run.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Don't tell me you're still hung up over THAT, now.<br/>You never change, do you?")
('Van', 'Shut your filthy mouth. You laid your hands on my<br/>baby girl and you chucked her like she was a damn<br/>chew toy!')
('Van', "...Hmph. Why am I even tryin' to lecture<br/>you, anyway? You wouldn't get it—all you do is<br/>break shit.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Oh, untwist your panties already. Besides, I'm<br/>pretty sure you caught a glimpse of my own prized<br/>possession earlier.")
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Now, tell me, would such a terrible person take such<br/>good care of it? Hmm?')
('Van', 'Tch. Of what, your bike?')
('Van', "It's a nice ride, I'll give you that—you treat your own<br/>stuff well, at least.")
('Van', "But don't think for a second that you're some<br/>saint now. You'll never know what that truck meant<br/>to me.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Well, at any rate, I'm not here to dig up old wounds.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Why make enemies out of allies? It's your choice to<br/>be butthurt about it.")
('Kaina', 'So that jaeger was looking for gas? Huh.')
('Kaina', "Beats me why she'd lug all the way out here for gas...")
('Kaina', '...but I guess she had her reasons. You guys are<br/>looking for her, I take it?')
('Kaina', "I'll help however I can.")
('Kaina', 'I was just talking to the boss. I wanted to ask what he<br/>thought about my career trajectory.')
('Kaina', "He told me I'm actually doing pretty well! I was kinda<br/>worried I was lagging behind.")
('Kaina', "But I have to keep his advice in mind: you have to<br/>practice the basics, or you won't have a foundation to<br/>build the rest of your skillset on.")
('Kaina', "He said I might be trying to rush things...and maybe<br/>he's right. Maybe I'm still too green for failing to<br/>realize that myself...")
('Kaina', "So far, I've been doing a lot of the grunt work.<br/>Mostly supply runs, as of late.")
('Kaina', "I'd really like to tackle bigger projects soon, like<br/>making my own machines from scratch or something!")
('Kaina', "I just feel like I learn by doing, y'know? There are<br/>certain skills you can only practice hands-on.")
('Kaina', 'The boss was pretty receptive to the idea of me taking<br/>a trip to Basel, actually.')
('Kaina', "But then, he followed it up with his usual, 'Make sure<br/>you're putting your studies first!' schtick.")
('Kaina', "I get where he's coming from. I just wonder how<br/>much of the basics I have left to learn before I can<br/>actually dive in to the nitty-gritty stuff.")
('Kaina', 'I wanted to help repair the bus, but the boss said no.<br/>He ended up working on it by himself.')
('Kaina', "I mean, I like to think I'm no greenhorn anymore.<br/>He trusts me to go out and buy the materials we<br/>need, even.")
('Kaina', 'But I wanna do more than that. I wanna do<br/>something big, like building my own machines from<br/>scratch or putting aftermarket mods on something!')
('Kaina', "But, well...maybe I really am rushing it. I dunno what<br/>I don't know.")
('Kaina', "My ancestors, they were Eastern-style blacksmiths.<br/>My parents would always tell me about their<br/>philosophy: 'your work is the sum of your knowledge.'")
('Kaina', 'I wonder how well that translates into the<br/>modern age...')
('Mayor Weng', "Ah, is this about Giovanna's soba efforts?")
('Mayor Weng', "I'm sorry to hear that she's having trouble with it...")
('Mayor Weng', '...but I do appreciate you helping her. I hope she gets<br/>the recipe just right.')
('Van', "Well, the field's not my forte, but I make sure I<br/>always do the job right. You can leave it to us.")
('Mayor Weng', "Haha! That's the spirit, young man.")
('Mayor Weng', "As for the soba...I can give some insight on the sauce,<br/>if you'd like.")
('Mayor Weng', 'My mother was born quite far to the East. She became<br/>skilled at preparing their cuisine, growing up.')
('Mayor Weng', 'From what I remember, soba sauce is made by first<br/>preparing a base soup stock, then adding the flavor of<br/>choice to it.')
('Feri', 'Huh. Can you tell us more?')
('Mayor Weng', 'The flavoring is a blend of various spices and sauces,<br/>usually local to the area...')
('Mayor Weng', 'When the blend is finished, you mix it into the<br/>soup stock.')
('Mayor Weng', 'Soba stock would traditionally use kelp or dried<br/>bonito, to my knowledge.')
('Mayor Weng', 'But there are many other bases you can use—dried<br/>vegetables, mushrooms, sardines, and the like.<br/>Really, anything goes, so long as it tastes good.')
('Agnès', 'So you can personalize the flavor of the soba<br/>that way... I see!')
('Agnès', "But kelp and bonito don't appear to be common<br/>ingredients here—at least, I'm not particularly<br/>familiar with them.")
('Van', 'Probably bigger out in the East.')
('Feri', 'I see... We can probably use stuff more common<br/>around here, instead.')
('Feri', 'So, what should we make the soup stock out of?<br/>Giovanna mentioned basil?')
('Van', 'Basil would work in a pinch, sure.')
('Van', "But I'm thinkin' if we wanna really make the soba<br/>pop, we should get something stronger. Seafood's a<br/>good bet.")
('Van', "We'll just need somethin' we can find around here...<br/>Shrimp, maybe? Think we could get some of that?")
('Mayor Weng', 'Aha! As it so happens, some of our merchants do<br/>carry that.')
('Mayor Weng', 'Shrimp is common in Eastern cuisine, so you should<br/>be able to find some from specialty merchants.')
('Mayor Weng', "I think I have some in my house, in fact. If you'd like<br/>it, you need only ask.")
('Van', "Perfect. Hopefully we don't gotta raid your pantry,<br/>but if we do, we'll let'cha know.")
('Feri', 'Nice! Our ingredients are secured.')
('Agnès', 'Secured indeed. Mission accomplished! Heehee.')
('Agnès', 'Thank you for your help, Mayor Weng!')
('Mayor Weng', 'Oh, my pleasure. I see some wonderful soba in<br/>my future!')
('Van', 'Okay, that should be good enough.')
('Agnès', 'I think we have a good grasp on the subject now!')
('Feri', "So do we go back to Giovanna's now?")
('Van', "Hmm... Actually, y'know, I think we're still<br/>missin' something.")
('Agnès', 'Oh? And what would that something be?')
('Van', "A secret spice, that's what.")
('Van', "Nothin' wrong with stickin' to the basics, but I say if<br/>we're makin' our own, we put a little spin on it.<br/>Somethin' off the beaten path, y'know?")
('Van', "Maybe somethin' that grows around here...<br/>How about local plants? We could probably find<br/>some stuff down by the creek.")
('Feri', "I'm...not sure what you mean, but you sound really<br/>confident about it. I trust you on this one!")
('Van', "Cool. If we don't find anything, no biggie.")
('Van', "Let's give it a crack and see what we come up with.")
('Agnès', 'Right!')
('Mayor Weng', 'Now, where could they have gone off to...?')
('Mayor Weng', 'With more traffic between the big cities, we might<br/>need to expect more visitors in our future—and<br/>potentially, more trouble.')
('Mayor Weng', "We need to figure out how to prepare for that.<br/>The way we are, we'll be overwhelmed if we get more<br/>big days like this.")
('Mayor Weng', 'How we prepare for the future will be most<br/>important, both in this context and in general.')
('Mayor Weng', "It's good that we're getting more visitors thanks to<br/>intercity traffic, but...")
('Mayor Weng', '...it seems all these city folk are bringing city trouble<br/>with them. Not to mention the influx of<br/>international traffic...')
('Mayor Weng', "We'll need to put a plan in place to protect this<br/>village, its residents, and these new visitors.")
('Mayor Weng', "It's quite the relief that we were able to house the<br/>passengers in the meeting hall for the night.")
('Mayor Weng', "It's not ideal—not even proper lodging, really—but it<br/>should let them get some sleep.")
('Mayor Weng', "I do worry about accidents like these... Rare though<br/>they may be, they've got us all wary.")
('Mayor Weng', "The roads have become safer thanks to the work<br/>done on the transportation networks, but today's<br/>taught us that we still can't let our guards down.")
('Mayor Weng', "A few villagers travel out often, whether for deliveries<br/>or other business. I'll need to warn them.")
('Mayor Weng', 'Soba flavoring is made by adding your flavor of<br/>choice to a base soup stock.')
('Mayor Weng', 'Traditionally, you would use kelp or bonito for<br/>the stock.')
('Mayor Weng', 'The flavoring is much more open-ended. You can<br/>experiment with it to your liking.')
('Mayor Weng', "I fear that's about all the advice I have. Tell Giovanna<br/>I wish her the best of luck.")
('Mayor Weng', 'Thank you all, again.')
('Mayor Weng', 'Ah, the soba was wonderful! The flavoring was<br/>simply spectacular, and not at all what I expected.')
('Mayor Weng', "Yet one more reason to look forward to this<br/>year's festival!")
('Mayor Weng', "Ah, you must have come on the bus... I don't believe<br/>we've met. If you need anything while you're here, I'll<br/>help however I can as the village mayor.")
('Mayor Weng', "We've been getting more tourists and travelers around<br/>this neck of the woods... I've been spending more of<br/>my time tending to them lately.")
('Mayor Weng', "We're a simple farming town, as you can see—though<br/>some of us do trek out to the city to deliver produce<br/>and spread the good word.")
('Mayor Weng', "At any rate, I'll see what I can do to help sort this<br/>business out. For now, make yourselves at home here<br/>and try to decompress.")
('Mayor Weng', 'I should talk to the driver when I get a free moment.')
('Mayor Weng', "This sort of thing isn't unprecedented, given our<br/>village lies on a busy international route.")
('Annha', 'With all the traffic lately, I knew trouble would come<br/>trundling in eventually...but not this much all at once.')
('Annha', "Everyone's understandably worried, seeing as the<br/>culprit's still at large.")
('Annha', "You might have already noticed, but my husband is of<br/>Eastern descent. I'd prefer you keep an open mind<br/>about it, unlike some others...")
('Annha', "He's half-Eastern, so some city visitors like to paint<br/>him as unsavory—the type with connections to<br/>certain underhanded groups.")
('Annha', 'But I assure you, he has nothing to do with<br/>those folk.')
('Annha', "Just because he's Eastern doesn't make him related<br/>to them.")
('Annha', 'At any rate, none of the villagers batted an eye at his<br/>heritage when he was elected. It was purely the<br/>outsiders stirring up drama.')
('Annha', "They made him out to be this...this swindler who<br/>only won the election because of his 'connections.'")
('Annha', 'Mmm, that was wonderful. The buckwheat was<br/>packed with flavor, but it was smooth and<br/>refreshing all the same!')
('Annha', "I can see why my husband loves Far<br/>Eastern recipes. I'd like to try some more!")
('Annha', 'Hello there. Are you here from the capital?')
('Annha', 'We see more and more tourists coming out here from<br/>the capital nowadays.')
('Annha', "Maybe it's our produce deliveries, or maybe it's<br/>the atmosphere... Either way, we're sort of making a<br/>name for ourselves.")
('Annha', "My husband's really emphasized trade in his time<br/>as mayor.")
('Annha', "We've even made delivery deals reaching as far<br/>as Crossbell!")
('Annha', "I think his efforts are really paying off. We're getting<br/>some wonderful word of mouth out there!")
('Vicar Johan', 'Today was not your ordinary day... Phew.')
('Vicar Johan', "I'm just relieved that Mayor Weng was able to smooth<br/>things over with the passengers.")
('Vicar Johan', "By the time I thought about lending out some of the<br/>chapel's rooms, he'd already arranged things with the<br/>meeting hall instead.")
('Vicar Johan', "He's still sharp as ever.")
('Vicar Johan', 'Thanks to him and Goddard, this whole debacle<br/>should pass within the next day or two.')
('Vicar Johan', "Watching everyone band together to figure out a<br/>solution like that...it makes me proud to serve here,<br/>even if it's just my assignment.")
('Vicar Johan', 'O Goddess, I pray again for the safety of these good<br/>villagers and the travelers they invited into<br/>their homes...')
('Vicar Johan', "Sister Belicia's love for this village truly humbles me.")
('Vicar Johan', 'There were many chapels that sought her skills,<br/>particularly in the Holy City.')
('Vicar Johan', 'But she turned all of them down to serve in the<br/>village she loves.')
('Vicar Johan', 'She reminds me of a sister who served here once upon<br/>a time... She shared that devotion to her home.')
('Vicar Johan', 'Perhaps that makes Sister Belicia her spiritual<br/>successor, in a sense.')
('Vicar Johan', "Welcome to the Creil Chapel. I don't believe<br/>we've met... Might you be travelers, then?")
('Vicar Johan', "I do hope you enjoy your stay here. I heard there was<br/>some sort of accident nearby, but I don't believe it's<br/>much to worry about.")
('Vicar Johan', 'Are you here to see the ruins, by chance? You can<br/>find them in the hills nearby.')
('Vicar Johan', "It's not quite as well known as other archaeological<br/>sites, so you're likely to get the area all to yourself, if<br/>you choose to visit.")
('Vicar Johan', "I've made the trip out there a few times myself, albeit<br/>on official church business. It's quite the curious<br/>spot, indeed.")
('Vicar Johan', "You'll see this series of pillars placed in a very<br/>deliberate pattern. Supposedly, animists of old paid<br/>tribute to their patron deities there.")
('Vicar Johan', 'As it happens, they discovered a giant stone there<br/>around twenty years ago. I happened to be there<br/>for it!')
(500, 'September 7th, 12:20PM')
('Feri', '...')
('Agnès', "Well, now. Isn't this a lovely village?")
('Agnès', "It's like an idyllic painting: rolling hills amidst clear<br/>streams, a windmill turning with the wind, and a<br/>touch of Middle Ages architecture.")
('Agnès', "The white flowers we saw in the wheat field were<br/>beautiful as well. They were buckwheat flowers,<br/>weren't they?")
('Van', 'Good eye. Fun fact, the village uses them in their<br/>specialty dish: galette.')
('Feri', "Oh, I've heard of those. Aida always says they make<br/>for a perfect lunch treat.")
('Feri', "Heehee. I'm excited to finally visit this place.")
('Van', "Anyway, that bus is gonna be out of commission for a<br/>while, so why don't we grab some grub?")
('Van', 'I hear the inn over there has the best food in<br/>the village.')
('Van', "While we're chowin' down, we can ask if Aida's unit<br/>dropped by there. Sound good?")
('Feri', 'Yep, yep!')
('Agnès', "Then let's go inside, shall we?")
('Feri', '...!')
('Agnès', 'Wow. This egg is amazing, and the buckwheat has a<br/>pleasant fragrance as well.')
('Agnès', 'Even the side vegetables are delicious!')
('Feri', '...')
('Van', "Montmart has Creil's buckwheat, too, but it's no<br/>surprise that it tastes even better here.")
('Van', 'Wait, they have orange and blackcurrant galettes on<br/>the menu? Hell, yeah. I am so ordering those.')
('Agnès', "Ooh! I think I'll do the same.")
('Feri', "*munch* I'll have some of those, too! *chew* Maybe<br/>I'll order seconds. *munch* And thirds!")
('Ran', "It sounds like you're all enjoying yourselves.")
('Ran', 'Galettes are the pride of our village. No one makes<br/>them quite like us, so make sure you savor the flavor.')
('Ran', "And while you're at it, why don't you try some of the<br/>other items on the menu? We have vegetable galettes,<br/>smoked salmon, and seasonal fruits.")
('Ran', "Oh, and you'll definitely want to try our desserts.<br/>We serve some of the best caramel and ice cream<br/>you'll ever have.")
('Feri', 'A-Ah! So many choices!')
('Agnès', 'Ugh... Is it bad that I want to order one<br/>of everything?')
('Van', "You got caramel and ice cream? I'll take ten of each.")
('Van', "...Wait, hang on. We didn't come here to drown<br/>ourselves in food—we came to ask you<br/>some questions. You work here a lot, right?")
('Ran', 'Of course. My parents own the place, after all.')
('Ran', "You saved the people on that bus, right? Well, fire<br/>away, then. I'll gladly answer any question you have.")
('Van', 'Cool. So I need you to think back to ten days ago.')
('Van', "Did any shady-lookin' people happen to stop by here?")
('Ran', "Ten days ago? I don't know if I can remember that<br/>far—")
('Ran', 'Wait... Actually, yes. There was a group of jaegers<br/>staying here around then.')
('Feri', 'I knew it!')
('Agnès', "If you don't mind me asking, how did you know they<br/>were jaegers? Did their attire give it away?")
('Ran', 'Oh, no. They were all wearing casual clothes.')
('Ran', 'I just know a jaeger when I see one. Our village is<br/>near the border of a few countries, so we get patrons<br/>like them from time to time.')
('Ran', "But as long as they pay their bills and don't cause<br/>trouble, they're just as welcome here as any of our<br/>other guests.")
('Agnès', "I suppose that's fair.")
('Van', 'This village is probably treated as a buffer zone<br/>between jaegers.')
('Van', "Bracers are always buzzin' around like flies, and<br/>there's a police station here.")
('Feri', "I've got a question for you.")
('Feri', 'Was there a woman with that group of jaegers?')
('Ran', 'Yes, I remember there being one. I believe she was<br/>the leader.')
('Ran', 'She had dark green hair tied back in a ponytail.<br/>Honestly, I thought she looked really cool.')
('Feri', "Yep... That's Aida, all right.")
('Agnès', "It sounds like we're on the right track.")
('Van', "Do you know what happened to 'em after that?")
('Van', 'Like, did they say where they were headed,<br/>for example?')
('Ran', "Normally, I wouldn't share that kind of information<br/>out of respect for their privacy, but since you know<br/>them, I don't mind sharing what I know.")
('Ran', "They stayed here for one night and left first thing in<br/>the morning. I don't know where they were going,<br/>though, and I haven't seen them since—")
('Ran', "Wait, no... That isn't quite right...")
('Van', 'Huh? Whaddaya mean?')
('Agnès', 'Have you seen one of them recently?')
('Ran', 'Yes, I think so, actually...')
('Ran', "I'm pretty sure I saw that same woman three<br/>days ago.")
('Van', 'For real?')
('Feri', "So does that mean she's still in the village?")
('Ran', "I think that's doubtful. And honestly, it was also<br/>pretty dark out when I saw her, so I might've<br/>been wrong.")
('Ran', "I didn't see any of her jaeger friends, either.")
('Ran', "You know, the more I talk it out, the more I realize I<br/>could've been totally mistaken. Sorry for getting your<br/>hopes up...")
('Agnès', "Don't be sorry! It's still a lead worth investigating.")
('Van', 'We should ask around town and see if someone else<br/>caught sight of her, too.')
('Van', "You've been a big help. I'll order one of the sweeter<br/>galettes later as thanks.")
('Ran', "Heehee. I'll hold you to that.")
('Ran', "I won't pry into your business, but I do hope you<br/>enjoy your stay in our village.")
('Van', "All right, gang. It's info-gatherin' time.")
('Van', "The goal's to determine if Aida really was here three<br/>days ago.")
('Van', "If luck's on our side, we'll get some good information<br/>in no time.")
('Feri', 'Fingers crossed!')
('Agnès', "All right. Let's get started, shall we?")
('Driver Roger', 'Hey, you guys.')
('Mayor Weng', 'Oh, did you have business outside the village?')
('Van', "Yeah, but we got it all wrapped up now. How's the<br/>bus holding up?")
('Driver Roger', "Well, it's nothing that can't be fixed, but it'll take us<br/>the rest of the day to get it up and running again.")
('Driver Roger', 'Thankfully, my supervisors were understanding.<br/>They said we can head back tomorrow morning.')
('Agnès', "Still, I'm sorry about this whole situation.")
('Feri', 'You said you were headed to some country called<br/>Remiferia, right?')
('Driver Roger', "Yeah, and it's not exactly a stone's throw away<br/>from here.")
('Driver Roger', "And I really don't want to make the trip at night, so<br/>we had to make lodging arrangements for all<br/>the passengers.")
('Van', "Oh, really? How'd you work that out?")
('Van', "I didn't think the inn had enough rooms for everyone.")
('Mayor Weng', 'We actually have a village hall where people can stay<br/>in an emergency.')
('Mayor Weng', "I'm letting the passengers stay there tonight free<br/>of charge.")
('Feri', "That's really nice of you!")
('Agnès', "I'm sure they're all breathing a sigh of relief.")
('Driver Roger', "Yeah, we owe him big time, and our company isn't<br/>about to let that debt go unpaid.")
('Driver Roger', 'Speaking of which, they also agreed to pay you, too.')
('Driver Roger', "They'll wire the mira to you soon. Heck, they<br/>might've already done it by now.")
('Van', "Nice! 'Preciate the business, my man. And if you<br/>ever find yourself in another jam, just give us a ring.")
('System', "Van's group went to the police station and explained<br/>the situation to Senior Officer Walley.")
('System', 'Kyle was formally questioned about what had<br/>transpired, and Nathan was taken into police custody.')
('Van', 'Oh, yeah. There was something else I wanted to run<br/>by you.')
('Mayor Weng', 'Hmm? And what might that be?')
('System', 'Van informed the mayor about the bicycle theft and<br/>asked if the culprit could perform community service<br/>in Creil to pay for its repairs.')
('System', "Thrilled to have an extra pair of working hands, the<br/>mayor accepted and went with them to speak to the<br/>inn's owner, Ben, about employing Nathan there.")
('System', 'Ben was all too happy to approve the plan, and thus,<br/>Nathan began his stint as a janitor—where he would<br/>do menial chores for many weeks to come.')
('System', 'Quest A Burgled Bicycle completed!')
('System', 'Received')
('Agnès', "All right. We're making headway in our investigation.<br/>We now know for sure that Aida was here three<br/>days ago.")
('Feri', 'Not only that, but she was also spotted the<br/>following day.')
('Feri', 'We also learned that the monsters around here are<br/>acting strange...')
('Van', 'Yeah... Dunno what to make of that yet.')
('Van', "I feel like the puzzle pieces are comin' together, but<br/>we're still a few short of the full picture.")
('Van', "We'll worry about that later, though. It's about time<br/>we head on back to the inn.")
('Feri', "Wh-What? We're staying here?")
('Agnès', "There's no way Aida is still in the village.<br/>Shouldn't we be out there looking for her?")
('Van', "Not tonight. There's no telling where she might've<br/>gone, and I'm not about to go on a wild goose chase.")
('Van', 'She could be in Remiferia, Ored, Nord Highlands...<br/>The list goes on.')
('Van', 'Besides...')
('Van', "I'm catchin' a whiff of something, and it ain't<br/>the galettes. Something smells fishy here.")
('Agnès', 'Umm... What do you mean exactly?')
('Feri', 'Are you talking about the monsters?')
('Van', "Well, yeah. They're part of it, too.")
('Van', 'Anyway, you gotta be prepared to head back to the<br/>capital tomorrow, Agnès—with or without us.')
('Agnès', "Yes, I know. I'll take a look at the bus schedule soon.")
('Agnès', 'But first, we should check in at the inn.')
('Van', "Good idea. The passengers aren't staying there, so<br/>they should have an open room or two.")
('Ran', "Well, here we are. I'm sorry that we didn't have more<br/>than one room for you all.")
('Agnès', "Oh, no. That's on us. We should've thought to book<br/>two rooms in advance.")
('Feri', "Those beds look super comfy. It's like they're inviting<br/>me to climb in, curl up, and conk out.")
('Van', "We're thinking about eating at around seven. I'll have<br/>one of those sweet galettes.")
('Ran', "Heehee. Coming right up! I'll be sure you get the<br/>finest we have.")
('Ran', 'In the meantime, please make yourselves comfortable.')
('Agnès', 'Erm...')
('Agnès', "(It's not like we had any other choice. Besides, Feri's<br/>here, too, so it's going to be fine. Yes... Totally fine.)")
('Feri', 'Uhh... You okay, Agnès?')
('Van', "Are you feelin' a little under the weather?")
('Agnès', "N-No! I'm perfectly fine! Never been better!")
('Agnès', 'A-Anyway, the plan was to gather a little bit more<br/>information before dinner, right?')
('Agnès', "Then there's no time to waste! Let's drop our luggage<br/>here and get back to work!")
('Feri', 'Huh? Oh, okay. Should we start with the old guy at<br/>the general store?')
('Van', 'Sure, sounds good.')
('System', 'Received')
('System', 'Interim reports can now be turned in.')
('Traveler Melchior', 'Oh? How long have you been standing there?')
('Agnès', "Not long. We're sorry if we disturbed you. We were<br/>just entranced by your song.")
('Agnès', "(I feel like I've heard that melody<br/>somewhere before...)")
('Feri', 'Yeah! Your voice is so soothing. Are you, like, a<br/>master musician or something?')
('Traveler Melchior', "Haha. I'd hardly call myself a master, but your praise<br/>is most appreciated.")
('Traveler Melchior', "Ah, I recognize you. You're the dashing heroes from<br/>Edith who saved us from those vicious wolves!")
('Van', 'Oh, you were on that bus?')
('Traveler Melchior', 'Indeed! I had a front-row seat to the performance.<br/>And what a marvelous performance it was!')
('Traveler Melchior', 'By the by, my name is Melchior. I am but a humble<br/>traveling bohemian. A lone wanderer of the world<br/>whose only compass is his heart.')
('Traveler Melchior', 'My heart guided me to a bus at the Messeldam port,<br/>and it took me all the way through the capital before<br/>stopping here.')
('Agnès', "You traveled all the way here from Messeldam?<br/>That's quite the roundabout journey.")
('Feri', "I'm a teensy bit jealous, mister. Traveling the world<br/>sounds like loads of fun!")
('Traveler Melchior', 'Alas, it does not put food on the table. I must stop for<br/>work on occasion to keep my howling stomach at bay.')
('Traveler Melchior', 'I do not have the luxury of purchasing first-class<br/>vehicles like yours. I envy you, my<br/>spiky-haired friend.')
('Van', "Heh. Thanks. I may've got her used, but she's been a<br/>great partner to me.")
('Van', "Let's steer away from the topic of cars for a sec.<br/>Where've you been all day? We didn't see you when<br/>we made our rounds earlier.")
('Van', "Did you go wanderin' off somewhere?")
('Traveler Melchior', 'Excellent guess. The hills outside the village piqued<br/>my interest, so I decided to take a quick hike<br/>over there.')
('Agnès', "You took a 'quick hike' all the way out there?")
('Feri', "I hope you didn't have any run-ins with monsters<br/>along the way...")
('Traveler Melchior', "Not at all. I've been traveling for some time now, so<br/>I've acquired something of a sixth sense for danger.")
('Traveler Melchior', 'As a result, it was an uneventful trip in that regard.<br/>I did manage to see something truly<br/>wonderful, though.')
('Van', 'Lemme guess: you saw the old stone ruins over there?')
('Van', 'Heard that a big statue was excavated in the area<br/>twenty years ago.')
('Traveler Melchior', 'Correct. It dates back to the ancient<br/>Zemurian civilization. In fact, it should be from the<br/>same age as the ruins in Nord.')
('Traveler Melchior', 'Though the statue here was a mere ten arge tall.<br/>The one in Nord is much, much larger.')
('Van', 'Is that right?')
('Traveler Melchior', "There's a large ruin made up of stone pillars, you see.")
('Traveler Melchior', "It dates back to the ancient Zemurian civilization.<br/>It's likely from the same age as the ruins in Nord.")
('Traveler Melchior', 'Evidently, a ten arge-tall statue was excavated from<br/>the area twenty years ago, too.')
('Traveler Melchior', "Sadly, the church got their grimy little hands on it,<br/>and it hasn't been seen since...")
('Traveler Melchior', "It's such a pity. Tourists would have flocked to this<br/>village had it remained.")
('Agnès', "Still, I doubt Creil has any trouble attracting tourists.<br/>I mean, just look at it: it's gorgeous.")
('Feri', 'Umm... Not to change the subject, but I wanted to<br/>ask you something.')
('Feri', 'Did you see anyone else when you were over by<br/>the hills?')
('Traveler Melchior', "I can't say I did, no. There were no other living<br/>beings in sight.")
('Feri', "Got'cha...")
('Van', 'Well, thanks, anyway.')
('Van', "Oh, yeah. Should mention that the bus isn't gonna be<br/>leaving till tomorrow now.")
('Traveler Melchior', 'So the mayor will provide a roof over my head?<br/>How benevolent of him.')
('Traveler Melchior', "Free is the best price, and I'm not about to object to<br/>his act of charity. Thank you for telling me.")
('Van', "No prob. We'll be stickin' around here, too, so if you<br/>need anything, give us a holler.")
('Traveler Melchior', 'How lovely. I shall keep that in mind!')
('Agnès', "This is the first time I've met someone who calls<br/>themselves a bohemian. He's certainly an odd one,<br/>isn't he?")
('Van', "Eh. He knows a good car when he sees one, so he's<br/>an all right guy in my book.")
('Agnès', "I see it doesn't take much to get on your good side.")
('Agnès', 'Is something the matter, Feri?')
('Feri', "O-Oh, it's nothing. I was just thinking.")
('Feri', 'Is it just me, or do those hills look like the perfect<br/>spot to set up camp?')
('Agnès', '...')
('Van', "I guess it's possible that Aida and her crew could be<br/>around there...")
('Van', "...but if they are, they're probably pretty far out.<br/>That guy would've spotted 'em over by the<br/>hills otherwise.")
('Van', "We can check the area out tomorrow morning.<br/>Sun's about to go down, so let's head back to the inn.")
('Feri', '...Okay.')
('Agnès', 'Your hunch definitely sounds plausible.')
('Agnès', "We can go over all the information we have once<br/>we're back in our room. Surely there's something that<br/>will point us in the right direction.")
('Van', "(I think we've got enough info at this point.)")
('Van', "(I'm sure we could dig up some more, but we can<br/>call it here if we want.)")
(500, 'September 7th, 6:20PM')
('Van', "So to recap, Aida's unit stayed at this inn ten<br/>days ago.")
('Van', "Then they left the next day, and everyone except Aida<br/>hasn't been back since.")
('Van', 'But Aida herself has been spotted a couple of times<br/>now—last sighting being two days ago.')
('Van', "What's more, she's only been seen at night.")
('Feri', 'Yeah, that about covers what we know...')
('Agnès', "I guess it's possible that she's working separately from<br/>the rest of her unit...")
('Agnès', "...but why would she do that? I just can't make heads<br/>or tails of it.")
('Feri', "Me, neither. We sometimes split up during ops, but<br/>it's generally not a good call.")
('Feri', 'Though even if she did put her unit on standby...')
('Feri', '...why would she send herself out on the field?<br/>Why not a scout?')
('Van', "No matter how you slice it, a jaeger commander doin'<br/>basic reconnaissance is weird as hell.")
('Van', 'Oh, and speaking of weird crap, what was with all<br/>that junk she was buying?')
('Agnès', 'You mean her bulk order of wiring? Yes, that was<br/>certainly strange...')
('Feri', "And the mysteries don't end there. We now know<br/>that they haven't come back for food since they left.")
('Van', 'Yeah. No one saw Aida get some grub, either.')
('Van', "There's something else that's been buggin' me: if<br/>they've been outside the village this whole time,<br/>how've they been eating?")
('Agnès', "...Now that you mention it, we didn't hear anyone<br/>talk about them buying food here, did we?")
('Feri', 'We can also rule out the possibility of them eating in<br/>the village.')
('Van', "Not to mention, somethin' was really off about<br/>those wolves.")
('Van', "They were actin' real funny in both fights—especially<br/>the second one.")
('Feri', "Good to know I wasn't the only one who<br/>thought that.")
('Feri', 'They looked like they were in a daze—no,<br/>scratch that. They looked downright petrified.')
('Feri', "I'm thinking they were driven by fear.")
('Agnès', 'Huh. You may be on to something there.')
('Agnès', 'But what exactly could they have been so fearful of?')
('Van', "That's the question, isn't it? They could just be scared<br/>of some other tough monsters, but maybe there are<br/>more sinister forces at work here...")
('Feri', "Well, whatever the answer is, I'm more convinced<br/>than ever that Aida's unit is somewhere near Creil.")
('Feri', 'There are so many good spots for setting up camp<br/>around here.')
('Van', "Yeah, like the hills from earlier or the forest on the<br/>other side of the buckwheat fields. There's also a<br/>place further upstream.")
('Van', "It still doesn't answer the question of how they're<br/>gettin' food, though. Can't picture them strollin' up<br/>to a farm and stealin' crops.")
('Feri', 'Heck no! They would never stoop so low!')
('Agnès', "It'd be much easier for them to just buy the food from<br/>the village.")
('Agnès', "It's not as though they're wanting for mira, right?")
('Van', 'Yeah. The cost of food is chump change compared to<br/>weapons and ammo.')
('Van', "And they don't gotta break the bank to afford a<br/>ten-day stay here, either.")
('Van', "That's why I'm thinkin' there's gotta be something<br/>more to this—some answer that's staring us in<br/>the face.")
('Van', "Something that'd force a flock of top-ranking jaegers<br/>from their nest and into hiding for ten days straight...")
('Van', "...and something that'd make the commander come<br/>to the village at night all by herself.")
('Feri', '...')
('Agnès', "Ugh. It feels like we're so close to solving this<br/>mystery, but we're still missing the critical pieces to<br/>this puzzle.")
('Van', "And we can't crack the case without 'em.")
('Van', 'Which means we gotta do some more—')
('Agnès', 'Hmm? Oh, dinner must—')
('Van', 'Get away from the door!')
('Agnès', 'Wha—?!')
('Feri', '...?!')
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Sharp as always, Arkride. And I can tell one of your<br/>companions is quick on the uptake.')
('Van', '...!')
('Agnès', "(Who's that...?)")
('Van', "You gotta be shittin' me...")
('Van', "The hell're you doing here?")
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Heheh. Good to see you, too.')
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Nice job fixing up that truck of yours. It looks<br/>brand-spanking new.')
('Van', 'Yeah. No thanks to you, you prick.')
('Walter the Direwolf', "Hey there, girlies. The name's Walter.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "My good ol' pal Arkride and I go way back.<br/>He helped me out with a job once.")
('Agnès', "A-Ah, it's a pleasure to meet you, then. My name is<br/>Agnès, and I'm his—")
('Feri', 'Keep away from him, Agnès!')
('Agnès', 'F-Feri...')
('Walter the Direwolf', "Well, this is a surprise. Never thought I'd run into a<br/>Kruga kid here.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "You ain't got much muscle to flex, but your eyes are<br/>as sharp as a hawk's.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "But I take back what I said about you bein' quick on<br/>the uptake. If you think you can come at me with a<br/>toy gun, then you're in for a world of hurt.")
('Feri', 'Eep!')
('Agnès', '(Wh-Who is he?)')
('Van', "Quit scarin' the girls, Direwolf. That's my client<br/>you're threatening.")
('Van', "And for the record, this is OUR room. You can't just<br/>barge in and act like you own the place.")
('Van', "I'm only gonna ask you this one last time: what the<br/>HELL are you doing here?")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Oh, I'm just here on a little business trip. I arrived in<br/>the village just a moment ago...")
('Walter the Direwolf', '...and imagine my surprise when I see a familiar truck<br/>at the entrance.')
('Walter the Direwolf', "I figured I'd swing by and say hello. I still owe you an<br/>apology, so I thought I'd smooth things over and ask<br/>you to take on another—")
('Van', 'Let me stop you right there. I am NEVER taking a<br/>job from you again.')
('Van', "Frankly, I don't give two shits about what brought<br/>you here. Now get the hell out of our room.")
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Damn, Arkride. Why you gotta be like that?')
('Walter the Direwolf', "I thought you took jobs from anyone, so why're you<br/>givin' me the cold shoulder?")
('Van', "'Cause you're an asshole.")
('Van', "Oh, and you can forget about that apology. I got my<br/>replacement, so we're square.")
('Van', "But bein' square and goin' back to square one ain't the<br/>same thing. You not only burned this bridge—you<br/>demolished it. Literally.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Heheh. Pups like you are a rare breed. I think I'll<br/>keep hounding you until you change your mind—or<br/>until I wear you down. Whichever comes first.")
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Oh, and as for what I came here for...')
('Walter the Direwolf', "...I'm lookin' for a wild mutt who's been let off his<br/>leash—a guy with mint green hair. Ring any bells?")
('Walter the Direwolf', "I'll take that silence as a yes. So he's in the<br/>village, then?")
('Feri', '...')
('Agnès', '...')
('Van', "I won't confirm or deny. I'm curious, though.<br/>Why're you after him?")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Oh, we're just playing a little game of hide and seek.<br/>That's all.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "I'm not in any rush, though. I think I'll chill here<br/>for tonight.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "I'll stay out of your hair, but remember, I'm always<br/>happy to lend a helping hand. Just throwin' it<br/>out there.")
('Van', 'GET. OUT.')
('Van', 'Whew...')
('Feri', '...')
('Agnès', 'Feri! Are you all right?!')
('Feri', "Y-Yeah, I'm fine... That was just...really intense.")
('Feri', 'Who was that guy, Van? He was terrifying...')
('Van', "You're, uh, better off not knowing. And that goes<br/>double for you, Agnès.")
('Agnès', "I'm guessing he's another person from the<br/>criminal underworld?")
('Van', "In a way, yeah. He's got the bite to back up his bark,<br/>so steer clear of him.")
('Van', "I don't envy that self-proclaimed bohemian. He must<br/>be in some deep shit if he's the Direwolf's next prey.")
('Van', "If that guy knows what's good for him, he'll drop<br/>everything and run for the hills.")
('Feri', "I'd probably turn tail if I was in his shoes. I'm staying<br/>faaar away from that bloodthirsty bloodhound.")
('Agnès', 'Ditto.')
('Agnès', "(Hmm... I'm beginning to wonder if that guy really is<br/>a 'bohemian'...)")
('Van', "All right. It's almost seven, which means dinner<br/>should be ready by now.")
('Van', 'The food oughta help us take our mind off<br/>that jackass.')
('Van', "He's probably drinkin' himself under the table as we<br/>speak, but we can just ignore him.")
('Van', "I'll treat you all to some ice cream galettes with<br/>caramel sauce. A dessert a day keeps the bastards<br/>at bay.")
('System', 'Earned')
(500, 'September 7th, 8:02PM')
('Agnès', "The food was wonderful...but I think I would've<br/>enjoyed it more if I wasn't so uneasy.")
('Feri', 'I just zeroed in on my food and put everything else<br/>out of my mind.')
('Feri', 'Which is, uh, probably not something a Kruga<br/>warrior should be bragging about.')
('Agnès', "Well, I'm sure the chef would be thrilled that you<br/>enjoyed their cooking so much.")
('Van', "Nothin' wrong with getting the most out of<br/>your meals. Eating good food is one of life's<br/>finest pleasures.")
('Van', 'Those galettes were out of this world.')
('Van', "Anyway, now that we've all calmed down, we should<br/>get back to business.")
('Van', "So we know that Aida's shown up at night<br/>multiple times.")
('Van', "This is a prime opportunity to ask people about that.<br/>Heck, if we're lucky, we might run into the<br/>woman herself.")
('Feri', "That'd be great!")
('Agnès', "I imagine most people have gone home, but there's<br/>sure to be a few who are out and about.")
('Agnès', 'Both the residents and the visitors might have some<br/>useful information for us.')
('Van', '...')
('Feri', "Wow! That's one cool-looking machine. Is it<br/>a vehicle?")
('Agnès', "Yes, this is called an orbal bike. It's kind of like a<br/>bicycle that's powered by orbal energy.")
('Van', 'Surprised you knew that much.')
('Van', 'They first became a thing in the Empire three years<br/>ago, but Verne had been looking into the idea around<br/>then, too.')
('Van', "A year after that, the four big manufacturers here<br/>started flooding the market with 'em.")
('Van', "This bad boy is Red Star's largest bike—and it's fast<br/>as hell. Top speed's 2,300 selge an hour.")
('Van', "I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess this thing<br/>belongs to the Direwolf.")
('Agnès', "I think you're right on the money.")
('Feri', "You'd have to be pretty tall to ride it.")
('Van', "This model just hit the market, so it probably had a<br/>hefty price tag. Definitely heftier than my truck's.")
('Van', 'Figures that a filthy Enforcer would be rolling<br/>in mira.')
('Van', "It's just not fair. He doesn't deserve a sweet ride after<br/>what he did to MY ride.")
('Feri', "I...feel like I'm missing something.")
('Agnès', 'What exactly happened between you two?')
('Van', "I'm glad you asked. Lemme give you the full<br/>rundown: it all started two and a half years ago...")
('Agnès', 'U-Umm, wait! Could you just give us the short<br/>version plea—')
('Van', "Nope. I'm not skimpin' on any details, so buckle up.")
('Van', 'A while back, I got a request from the Direwolf.<br/>He runs with a dangerous crowd, so I was hesitant to<br/>take it on at first.')
('Van', "But the job sounded simple enough, and there was<br/>someone in need of help. Figured it couldn't hurt to<br/>back him up.")
('Van', 'The two of us drove someplace and beat the shit outta<br/>some scumbags.')
('Van', 'Then, just when I thought it was all over, they<br/>brought out the big guns: a giant Erebonian weapon.')
('Van', "It was a seven-arge tall humanoid robot that the<br/>Empire's nobles used in a war several years back.<br/>I imagine they got it off the black market.")
('Van', 'I knew immediately that it was way out of our league.<br/>I told the Direwolf we should fall back, but he had<br/>another bright idea...')
('Van', "That freakin' bastard threw MY TRUCK at<br/>the robot!")
('Van', 'The attack did the job, of course. He was able to<br/>finish it off barehanded after that.')
('Van', 'Too bad it came at the expense of my poor baby!<br/>He turned her into a pile of scrap metal!')
('Feri', "I-I'm...sorry for your loss.")
('Agnès', "But we rode here in it just this morning. I'm guessing<br/>you had it fixed at some point?")
('Van', "What? Hell no! You can't fix a car that's been<br/>chucked at a giant robot!")
('Van', 'He gave me this one in a vain attempt to extend an<br/>olive branch.')
('Van', "It's the same model as my old one. The cheap asshole<br/>bought it used, but it was in decent enough condition,<br/>I guess...")
('Van', "But I ain't acceptin' his apology! I poured my heart,<br/>soul, and hard-earned mira into decking my old<br/>partner out with custom parts.")
('Van', "I had to do it all over again, and that took me<br/>two years! TWO YEARS! That's why I'm holdin' on<br/>to this grudge till I'm six arge under.")
('Feri', 'Was that a car horn?')
('Van', "The hell? Who'd honk their horn in the middle of<br/>the night?")
('Agnès', "That's a...strange-looking vehicle.")
('Van', "It's an off-roader from Leno's range. They're good for<br/>drivin' on rough terrain.")
('Van', 'But that emblem is...')
('Feri', 'The Bracer Guild?!')
('Bracer Alvis', '*sigh* That was a longer drive than I expected.<br/>Oh, and that looks like the bus.')
('Bracer Alvis', "Guess they finished the repair job. I should speak<br/>with the driver and the authorities so I can get up to<br/>speed on what's been happening.")
('Bracer Alvis', "Daaamn. Is that an Ingert pickup truck?<br/>Someone's got good taste.")
('Bracer Alvis', "Holy crap! Am I really seeing Red Star's Monster<br/>Machine in the flesh?!")
('Bracer Alvis', "Man. That other ETWS bike is pretty cool, too, but<br/>this thing is a work of art. What I wouldn't give to<br/>get my hands on one of these...")
('Van', "Heheh. Someone's a fan, huh?")
('Bracer Alvis', "Whoa! Where'd you come from? Don't scare me<br/>like that.")
('Bracer Alvis', "Were you all passengers on this bus? I'm from the<br/>Bracer Guild, and I have some ques—")
('Bracer Alvis', 'Oh, no. Not YOU!')
('Van', "Oh, yeah. I remember you. You're the guy who was<br/>with Zin and Elaine yesterday.")
('Van', "I heard you took a train out of town for business.<br/>I'm guessin' you wrapped that up early.")
('Agnès', 'Were you asked to come here afterwards? Phew.<br/>No rest for the weary, huh?')
('Bracer Alvis', "Ah, well... It's all part of the job. Everyone else's<br/>hands are tied, so I decided to come—")
('Bracer Alvis', "Wait, that's not important!")
('Bracer Alvis', "My name is Alvis. I'm a C-rank bracer.")
('Bracer Alvis', "There's no need to introduce yourself, Van Arkride.<br/>I'm well aware of you and your 'profession.'")
('Bracer Alvis', "Instead, why don't YOU explain what you're doing<br/>HERE, hmm?")
('Feri', '...')
('Van', 'Classified. If you want that info, you gotta join the<br/>Arkride Solutions crew.')
('Van', 'You should be glad we were in the area, though, since<br/>we saved that bus and everyone on it.')
('Bracer Alvis', 'Wh-What? You did?!')
('Bracer Alvis', 'Wait, no... I remember hearing that. I also heard you<br/>demanded compensation for it.')
('Bracer Alvis', 'What kind of man seeks to profit off those in peril?<br/>No bracer would ever dream of doing such a thing!')
('Bracer Alvis', 'Not only that, but you have the GALL to charge<br/>higher rates than us. Have you no shame?!')
('Van', 'Uhh. Not really?')
('Bracer Alvis', 'Urgh! At least try to come up with an explanation for<br/>your actions!')
('Agnès', 'Excuse me. May I interject for a moment?')
('Agnès', 'I initially had reservations about his handling of the<br/>bus incident as well.')
('Agnès', "However, I've come to the conclusion that Van's price<br/>was perfectly reasonable, given the risk involved.")
('Agnès', "Also, I would like clarification on one of your points:<br/>why should he be expected to behave like a bracer<br/>when he isn't one?")
('Bracer Alvis', 'H-Huh? Well, umm...')
('Agnès', "Furthermore, the guild receives financial aid from the<br/>Epstein Foundation. Unlike you, Van doesn't have<br/>that privilege.")
('Agnès', 'So it only makes sense that he would charge a little<br/>more than you. He has to make ends meet, too,<br/>you know.')
('Agnès', "I truly admire the guild's ideals—and that's precisely<br/>why I'm disappointed to see you chastise one of the<br/>people you are sworn to protect and serve.")
('Bracer Alvis', 'Oh...')
('Feri', "Got 'em.")
('Van', 'Heh.')
('Bracer Alvis', "(Ugh. First Elaine stuck up for this no-good punk,<br/>and now this girl's doing the same... Why?!)")
('Bracer Alvis', "(He must've brainwashed them all! That's the<br/>only explanation!)")
('Bracer Alvis', "Okay, okay. I'll admit that I was a BIT out of line.<br/>And you have my thanks for saving the bus...")
('Bracer Alvis', "...but I suggest you back off from here, spriggan!<br/>The Bracer Guild's on the case now, so your presence<br/>is no longer required!")
('Bracer Alvis', "We'll have this monster mystery squared away in no<br/>time flat, so if you could mosey on over to the<br/>sidelines, that'd be swell!")
('Feri', '...Wow. Rude much?')
('Feri', "I've never met a hot-headed bracer before. All the<br/>ones I've run into back home were pretty chill.")
('Agnès', "Oh, I didn't realize the guild had branches in the<br/>Central East.")
('Van', "Wouldn't be living up to their ideals if they didn't.")
('Van', "He ain't exactly mature, but he's gotta be at least a<br/>little strong if he made it to C-rank.")
('Van', 'Might be able to make use of him later. Heheheh.')
('Agnès', "Umm, Van? You do realize you're sounding like a<br/>villain, right?")
('Feri', 'I wonder where he ran off to?')
('Van', 'Probably the police station. We can make our way<br/>over there later.')
('Agnès', 'Well, we managed to gather a lot of information in<br/>record time.')
('Feri', 'Yeah.')
('Van', 'I think we can just ignore that bracer for now.')
('Van', "Though I'm surprised we never ran into that<br/>mint-haired guy.")
('Van', "Then there's the story we heard at the factory.")
('Feri', 'The one about the gasoline, right? Yeah...')
('Feri', "That liquid was once a common fuel source for<br/>machines, but now it's mainly used as a solvent<br/>or for starting fires...")
('Feri', 'Our clan keeps some in storage for certain<br/>weapons, too.')
('Agnès', "I heard you can find the substance it's made from in<br/>the Central East.")
('Agnès', 'But why would Aida need something like that?')
('Van', 'Could ask the same thing about the wires.')
('Ran', 'Ah! There you are!')
('Van', "Oh, hey. What's up?")
('Ran', 'You know that woman you were asking about earlier?')
('Ran', 'Well, she just dropped by the inn!')
('Agnès', 'Wait, what?!')
('Feri', 'Aida came here? For real?!')
('Ran', 'She asked me to do something for her and then<br/>darted off before I could mention you were looking<br/>for her.')
('Ran', "She left three letters with me. One of them is<br/>addressed to an...'Eisenschild'?")
('Ran', "Another's to the guild branch in the capital, and the<br/>last one is to a 'Kruga'... That's not in Calvard, right?")
('Ran', 'She left me some money to mail them out, but when<br/>I opened the envelope, there was 10,000 mira inside.')
('Ran', "I don't need this much just to send a few letters...<br/>That's why I ran out after her.")
('Ran', "Also, she looked...dreadfully pale. If it's not too much<br/>to ask, could you go look for her?")
('Feri', 'Aida!')
('Van', "Hey, wait up, kiddo! ...We're going after her!")
('Agnès', "R-Right! We'll take care of this, so don't worry!")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Heh. Now that's a face I didn't expect to see.<br/>Not here, anyway.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "She must be in dire straits if she didn't notice me.")
('Feri', 'Aida! Where are you?!')
('Van', 'Cool your jets, Feri!')
('Van', "She can't have gone that far. Let's head to one of the<br/>exits and see if we can find her.")
('Feri', 'U-Understood!')
('Agnès', 'If she really is unwell, we should hurry!')
('Feri', 'Aida!')
('Aida', 'Feri?!')
('Aida', "Haha... I'm not dreaming, am I?")
('Aida', 'And after I went through all the trouble to write a<br/>letter and drop it off at the inn...')
('Aida', "I'm gonna assume our regimental commander got in<br/>touch with your people. He asked about us, didn't he?")
('Feri', "Yes! You really had me worried, you know! I thought<br/>something might've happened to you!")
('Feri', "I just had to track you down. That's why I went<br/>straight to Calvard's capital and enlisted the help of<br/>a spriggan.")
('Aida', "Oh, I've heard quite a few stories about you. Heheh.<br/>Nice to finally meet you face to face.")
('Van', "The pleasure's mine. My name is Van Arkride.<br/>Dunno if you remember, but we fought on the same<br/>side two years ago.")
('Van', "Mind telling us what's going on? You, uhh, don't look<br/>so hot.")
('Feri', "You aren't hurt, are you? Here, let me—")
('Aida', 'Stay away from me!')
('Feri', "A-Aida? What's wrong?")
('Aida', "Sorry. Didn't mean to lash out at you.")
('Aida', "But really, there's...nothing you can do for me now.")
('Agnès', "I don't think we're quite on the same page here.")
('Agnès', "Could you fill us in on what's going on? There may<br/>be something we can do to help.")
('Aida', "Huh? Who're you?")
('Van', "She's a part-timer at my office. More importantly, are<br/>you—")
('Bracer Alvis', 'Hey! What are you doing over there?')
('Bracer Alvis', "Ugh, you three again... Wait, hang on. There's a<br/>fourth now?")
('Sr. Officer Walley', "I haven't seen you around these parts. Are you<br/>a tourist? No—")
('Bracer Alvis', "You're a jaeger, aren't you?")
('Aida', 'Ha. So a bracer was here all along, and I wandered in<br/>without even noticing. Pitiful.')
('Aida', "The boss is probably rolling in his grave right now.<br/>If he saw me like this, he'd be ashamed he ever gave<br/>me the name Flameeater...")
('Feri', 'Aida! Let me help you!')
('Feri', "There's gotta be something—")
('Aida', 'Haha. I still had so many things I wanted to<br/>teach you.')
('Aida', 'Thanks for looking out for my little sis, Van.')
('Aida', "I've got one little favor to ask of you before—")
('Aida', "I'm too late!")
('Sr. Officer Walley', 'Wh-What is that...?')
('Bracer Alvis', 'Monsters? Crap. It must be those wolves again.')
('Van', "Nah. But we're getting closer to what's been driving<br/>them to attack.")
('Feri', '...!')
('Agnès', 'Are you serious...?')
('Aida', "Looks like time's up. Fate's calling...")
('Aida', 'Everyone, you have to make it out of here alive, no<br/>matter what! And Feri, you have to live, too—for me!')
('Agnès', '...?!')
('Sr. Officer Walley', 'Aaaaah!')
('Bracer Alvis', 'Are those military monsters?!')
('Van', "Yeah, but they ain't exactly normal.")
('Feri', 'Aida, wait!')
('Feri', 'Get out of my way!')
('Van', "Ferida, you gotta focus on what's in front of us!<br/>'Fight to survive'—that's what your friend would tell<br/>you, right?!")
('Aida', 'Everyone, you have to make it out of here alive, no<br/>matter what! And Feri, you have to live, too—for me!')
('Bracer Alvis', 'Tch...')
('Sr. Officer Walley', 'Wh-What are we supposed to do?')
('Agnès', "We'll take care of these three!")
('Bracer Alvis', "Gah. All right, fine! I don't care what happens to<br/>him, but you two stay safe!")
('Feri', "Okay! Let's wipe the floor with these creepy things!")
('Van', "Careful, something's up with 'em. Stay on your<br/>guard—especially you, Agnès.")
('Agnès', "Will do. I'll lend you my support!")
('Feri', 'No way!')
('Agnès', 'We take down three, and another three take<br/>their place...')
('Van', "There's no more room for doubt: these things're what<br/>scared the piss out of all those wolves.")
('Van', "Their strength and speed are almost uncanny, but<br/>what's really gettin' me is—")
('Agnès', "Th-That's not possible...")
('Feri', 'Oh, Arusha...')
('Van', 'Get back, you two!')
('Walter the Direwolf', "Can't a man enjoy a drink in peace?")
('Feri', 'Ah!')
('Agnès', "You're that man from earlier!")
('Van', "Never thought I'd say this in a million years, but I'm<br/>happy to see your ugly mug.")
('Bracer Alvis', 'I-I managed to take out one of them! How are things<br/>going on your—')
('Bracer Alvis', "Ack! There's MORE?! And who in the blue blazes<br/>are—")
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Heheh. Leave the small fry to me.')
('Walter the Direwolf', 'In return, I expect you to forget about the car shit<br/>and let bygones be bygones.')
('Van', "That's a tall order.")
('Van', "Don't screw this up, Direwolf! And you back him up,<br/>bracer boy!")
('Bracer Alvis', "Where do you think you're going?! ...Wait, did he<br/>say DIREWOLF?!")
('Bracer Alvis', "What's an Enforcer of Ouroboros doing here?")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Heheheh. It's time to meet your maker, you<br/>damn mutts.")
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Let me show you the fangs of a REAL wolf.')
(40301, "This year's been a good one, hasn't it? We've had a<br/>bountiful harvest, and the demand's on the up and up.")
(40302, "And it'll keep going up 'cause we have so many new<br/>farming techniques for 1209 and beyond. Next year's<br/>festival is sure to be better than the last!")
('Kent', "I had loads of fun today, but I would've had even<br/>more fun if Lashkar was here...")
('Kent', "Tomorrow's the last day of the festival...")
('Annie', 'Yeah... I heard the car he was riding in broke down in<br/>the capital.')
('Annie', "It'll be okay, though. He'll be here tomorrow for sure,<br/>so cheer up!")
('Ranji', "Well, lookie here! It's everyone's favorite reporter!<br/>Why're you walkin' around town all by<br/>your lonesome?")
('Ranji', "Why don'tcha drop by the bar and grab a couple<br/>drinks with me? The night's still young!")
('Dingo', "I, umm, really shouldn't...")
('Motona', "Now, now, dear. Don't pressure the poor man.")
('Motona', "I'm sorry about him. He's just lonely because our<br/>daughter couldn't make it in time for the festival.")
('Ranji', "I-I'm not lonely! She said she'd be here tomorrow!")
('Melissa', "Oh, it's that hot reporter guy! Hello! What's the<br/>latest scoop?")
('Ran', "Perhaps he'd be kind enough to do another<br/>feature on our inn.")
('Ran', "Why don't you stop on by? Drinks are on the house!")
('Dingo', "Trust me, I'd love to. Unfortunately, I've got an early<br/>start tomorrow—")
('Dingo', "...On second thought, I'll take you up on that offer.<br/>I'll be over soon. Save me a table.")
('Melissa', 'Yaaay!')
('Ran', "Sounds good. We'll see you there!")
('Dantès', 'Our moment is at hand, my fellow countrymen.')
('Dantès', 'We shall vanquish the knights and the noblemen,<br/>trample the enemy underfoot, and stain the palace<br/>floors with their blood.')
('Dingo', "Fancy seeing you here. I never thought I'd find you<br/>casually whistling La Oraciónese.")
('Dantès', "It's been some time since we last met, Dingo Brad.<br/>Though we did cross paths in Tharbad—<br/>albeit briefly.")
('Dantès', "If we exclude that little encounter, I haven't seen you<br/>since your days as a mere informant in Messeldam.")
('Dingo', "Yeah, and you were still Enrique's<br/>second-in-command back then.")
('Dingo', 'I caught wind of your arrival here. I thought the idea<br/>was ludicrous at the time, and yet there you stand.')
('Dingo', "So answer me this: what's your game here,<br/>Gerard Dantès?!")
('Dantès', 'Heheh.')
('Dantès', "You're a persistent one, I'll give you that. You've been<br/>following our trail for a long time now.")
('Dantès', 'And lo and behold, your dogged pursuit has finally<br/>borne fruit. Congratulations. I shall bestow upon you<br/>a reward—one far greater than any Fulitzer.')
('Dingo', 'Let me guess: the sweet release of death, huh?')
('Dantès', 'Well, yes. It truly is a pity. I do sincerely respect your<br/>investigative prowess.')
('Dantès', 'However, before you meet your demise, I will offer<br/>you a glimpse of the end of time.')
('Dingo', 'Is that...thing made of shards?')
('Dantès', 'Correct. This is the artifact that Basel professor fell<br/>just short of completing...')
('Dantès', 'Or rather, this is a substitute for it.')
('Dingo', 'W-Wait...')
('Dantès', "It's called an explosive lens, or so I hear.")
('Dantès', 'Alas, the professor met an untimely end before he<br/>could finalize a formula for the most<br/>efficient structure.')
('Dantès', 'Though this shard-based replica will suffice—and I<br/>can detonate it with my sword.')
('Dantès', 'Its destructive capabilities are beyond compare.<br/>This little village will be history.')
('Dingo', "A-Are you insane? You'll get caught up in the<br/>blast, too!")
('Dantès', "Ah, but I have an ace up my sleeve: teleportation.<br/>Still, I'd place my odds of survival at 30%...")
('Dantès', '...but the thrill of the gamble is irresistible.')
('Dingo', 'Wait! There are children here! Not even Aidios could<br/>forgive such a heinous act!')
('Dingo', "Please give these people time to evacuate. I'm<br/>begging you!")
('Dantès', "I'm afraid doing that would defeat the entire point of<br/>this experiment.")
('Dantès', "Every living creature is equal in the face of true fear.<br/>Demonstrating that is my life's purpose.")
('Dantès', 'Heh. How fortunate that your camera can now<br/>connect to a Xipha.')
('Dantès', 'Though it will not save you, so why not drop it and<br/>fight to the bitter end?')
('Dingo', "Because I know I can't stop you...but thanks to this, I<br/>can pass the torch to those who will.")
('Dingo', 'Burn in the pits of Gehenna, Gerard Dantès!')
('Dantès', 'Such bravado! Now take your final shots—and die!')
('Dingo', '(Van... Marielle...)')
('Dantès', 'Hahaha... AHAHAHAHAHAHA!')
('Hunter Rutts', "Just got back from a hunt, and I heard the news...<br/>You tellin' me monsters attacked a bus?")
('Van', "Yeah. Was rollin' by the village and it just<br/>got jumped. We fought 'em off, though—no injuries<br/>to the passengers.")
('Hunter Rutts', 'Good, good... They were lucky to have you there.')
('Hunter Rutts', "Somethin' about that attack rubs me the wrong way...<br/>I noticed the monsters were actin' all sorts of weird<br/>out on my hunts.")
('Agnès', "Oh? You've seen them firsthand? What specifically<br/>was strange about them?")
('Hunter Rutts', "So, I run into these packs of wolves around the<br/>village sometimes...and I've noticed 'em gettin' a lot<br/>more territorial recently.")
('Hunter Rutts', "I can't really call it violent or aggressive, though.<br/>It feels like somethin' else...")
('Feri', 'So the monsters are...on edge?')
('Van', "Or otherwise actin' up.")
('Hunter Rutts', "That's what I'm noticin', yeah. It doesn't feel like<br/>anger. It feels like...fear.")
('Hunter Rutts', "I dunno what could be rattlin' them so hard, though.<br/>They hadn't been causin' trouble until now.")
('Hunter Rutts', "Y'all watch yourselves out there... Heh, don't mean to<br/>nag ya, though. Doubt you need me to remind ya.")
('Agnès', 'Oh, no, by all means, thank you for the warning.<br/>Take care on your hunts.')
('Feri', 'So, Van, does that mean...?')
('Van', "Maybe. We dunno for sure that the wolves that<br/>hounded the bus were actin' that same way—all we<br/>know, it could've been somethin' else.")
('Van', "But that's a good guess, so let's keep it in mind.")
('Sr. Officer Walley', 'So you were the guys who saved those passengers?<br/>You have my thanks.')
('Van', 'No prob. Hey, you mind if I ask you a few questions?<br/>Tryna look into the attack myself.')
('Sr. Officer Walley', 'I...see?')
('Sr. Officer Walley', "I do appreciate your help, but I'm not sure I wanna<br/>get wrapped up in that whole situation, myself...")
('Van', "Oh, you'll be fine. Real jiffy, I promise.")
('Van', "And full disclosure here: we're actin' on the authority<br/>of a certain intelligence department.")
('Sr. Officer Walley', "Wha...? You don't mean the CID?")
('Van', "Let's just say I got the big boys on speed dial.")
('Feri', '(Wait, what is he talking about?)')
('Agnès', "(He's, er...very good at stretching the truth. He's not<br/>TECHNICALLY lying, but...)")
('Sr. Officer Walley', "...Ahem! W-Well, I suppose it won't kill me.<br/>What do you wanna ask about?")
('Van', "Right, so, we're lookin' into this band of jaegers that<br/>blew through town maybe ten-ish days ago.")
('Van', "We're thinkin' they might've come back recently.<br/>You seen anything that fits their description?")
('Sr. Officer Walley', 'Hmm... Yeah, actually, I do recall bumping into a<br/>shady woman loitering around here.')
('Sr. Officer Walley', 'She was in the area, alone, on my patrol three nights<br/>ago. I saw her again the following night.')
('Feri', 'That has to be her...!')
('Feri', 'You said she was alone?')
('Sr. Officer Walley', 'She was, yeah—I found that strange myself.')
('Sr. Officer Walley', 'And that she only showed up at night made her even<br/>more suspicious.')
('Agnès', 'I see... Do you know what her motive might<br/>have been?')
('Sr. Officer Walley', "I can't say for certain. None of the villagers reported<br/>assault or stolen goods at the time...")
('Sr. Officer Walley', "...and it's not unheard of for jaegers to stop here<br/>for supplies. I don't see any criminal intent in her<br/>behavior, suspicious though it was.")
('Van', "Fair enough. I guess she stands out just by being a<br/>jaeger, even if she ain't causing trouble.")
('Van', 'What we do know now is that she came back twice,<br/>well after her unit came through...')
('Kaina', "Welcome... Oh! You must be the travelers I've<br/>heard about! How can I help you?")
('Kaina', 'Anything you need done with your orbments?<br/>Maintenance, maybe?')
('Kaina', "You just leave it to me! I'm no greenhorn, despite<br/>what the boss says!")
('Van', 'Thanks. We might hit you up for that in a bit, but<br/>right now, I wanna ask you some questions.')
('Van', "You recall seein' a band of jaegers come by around...<br/>ten days ago?")
('Kaina', 'Jaegers? Actually, yeah...')
('Kaina', 'I think I saw the boss talking to this<br/>jaeger-looking girl...')
('Kaina', "That would've been, what, the night before last?<br/>Yeah, pretty sure.")
('Feri', "I'm guessing she needed work done on her weapon...<br/>or some supplies, maybe.")
('Kaina', "Hmm... No, I think it might've been something else.<br/>She asked to borrow our truck.")
('Kaina', 'So I think she was doing some hauling that night.<br/>Hauling what, I dunno.')
('Van', "...Yeah, that is odd. Comin' out alone under the cover<br/>of darkness just to haul stuff around?")
('Kaina', 'I know, right? It made me awfully curious.')
('Kaina', 'At the time I thought, like, maybe she just needs<br/>some tools or equipment or something?')
('Van', "Maybe for fixin' up their guns or other stuff...<br/>Good to know. Thanks.")
('Agnès', 'The people at the inn said she came through three<br/>days ago...')
('Agnès', "...but then she came back the following night, because<br/>she talked to the factory boss 'the night before last.'")
('Van', "Heya, gramps. We're back from our rounds.")
('Van', 'You remember anything new?')
('Feri', 'Excuse me, umm... Can we ask you about something?')
('Feri', 'Do you remember any of those jaegers buying<br/>supplies from you when they came into town ten<br/>days ago?')
('Focken', "I do, in fact... It was the week before last. A whole<br/>band of 'em came in and bought all kinds of things.")
('Focken', 'Then their leader came by—she was a real beaut.')
('Hans', 'Now that you mention it, I remember seeing a<br/>woman of that description when I came back from a<br/>delivery run.')
('Hans', 'That was...three days ago, I wanna say? Right up<br/>toward closing time.')
('Feri', 'Really?! What did she buy?')
('Feri', 'If we know what she bought, we might be able to find<br/>a motive!')
('Focken', 'Now, what did I get for her...?')
('Focken', 'If I remember... I...')
('Focken', 'What WAS it? I can see her pretty little face, but<br/>what did she...?')
('Hans', "Er, Gramps, don't you have your ledger? The record<br/>should be in there.")
('Focken', 'Oh, yes, of course I do. Lemme check it for you...')
('Focken', 'Erm... Ah...')
('Focken', "...Oh, blast it, it's just too small for these old eyes.")
('Van', "(Man's on the wrong side of retirement age.)")
('Hans', "You're the one who wrote it, for crying out loud...<br/>I'll read it.")
('Hans', "Okay, sooo... The group from ten days ago, there<br/>wasn't anything out of the ordinary in there. Just your<br/>run-of-the-mill supplies.")
('Hans', 'But the captain, it says here that she bought wire.<br/>Lots of it.')
('Van', 'Huh. Camp boundary, maybe? Battle lines...?')
('Feri', 'Why would she go out of her way to buy wire in the<br/>middle of a retreat, though?')
('Agnès', 'And this was during her first stop at the village, not<br/>the second.')
('Van', 'Yeah, that might be important. One more question<br/>for you.')
('Van', 'She buy anything else? Rations, ammo, stuff like that?')
('Focken', 'Uhh... Nope. Just the wire.')
('Van', "Nothin', huh?")
('Van', "Thanks for the info—this'll help a lot. Give Victor<br/>my best, yeah?")
('Kaina', 'Ah, welcome back.')
('Kaina', 'Hey, boss? These guys wanted to ask you<br/>some questions. Have you got a minute?')
('Boss Goddard', 'Oh, yeah. I remember seeing you around earlier.')
('Boss Goddard', "Sorry for blowin' you off, had to hammer out repairs<br/>on the bus.")
('Agnès', "Oh, not a problem. I'm sure the passengers are much<br/>more relieved now.")
('Feri', 'Your apprentice was a big help, too!')
('Kaina', 'Yup, yup! I handled their every need while you were<br/>away, no sweat!')
('Kaina', 'Oh, that reminds me. They had one<br/>specific question...')
('Kaina', 'I remember seeing you talk to that jaeger lady the<br/>other day, before you lent her our truck. What was<br/>she doing with it?')
('Boss Goddard', 'Oh, her. Right.')
('Boss Goddard', 'She bought a whole ton of gas, as it happened.')
('Boss Goddard', 'Hell, she bought every last drop I had of the stuff.<br/>I just had it lying around as a solvent before she<br/>snatched it up.')
('Boss Goddard', "Not somethin' you buy in bulk nowadays...but I'm not<br/>pokin' that hornet's nest. Ain't my business.")
('Van', 'Gas? You mean the stuff that old combustion engines<br/>ran on?')
('Van', 'I mean...I guess a jaeger might have their uses for it?<br/>You never know.')
('Feri', "I don't know why Aida would be using those old<br/>kinds of machines...")
('Feri', "And whatever she's doing with it, why would she pick<br/>it up now, of all times?")
('Van', "Right, you'd think this'd be a low priority for her<br/>right now.")
('Agnès', 'So, just what could she be using it for...?')
('Van', 'I can think of a couple off the top of my head...')
('Van', "...but we don't have enough info to make any kind of<br/>educated guess. We gotta piece together the big<br/>picture first.")
('Mayor Weng', 'Hmm... This is quite concerning.')
('Annha', 'Agreed... Should we contact the guild?')
('Agnès', 'Hmm? Did something else happen...?')
('Mayor Weng', 'Ah, good to see you again.')
('Mayor Weng', "As you might have heard, we've lent the meeting hall<br/>to the stranded passengers for the night.")
('Annha', "I went to check on them just now, and we can't find<br/>one of the passengers!")
('Annha', "From the other passengers' description, it was a man<br/>with a very elaborate getup and striking appearance.")
('Mayor Weng', "We looked at the inn, and he didn't check into a<br/>room there, either.")
('Mayor Weng', "He may very well be in danger if he's strayed outside<br/>the village...")
('Agnès', '(Van, could that be...?)')
('Van', '(Fits the bill. The self-proclaimed bohemian that a<br/>certain jackass was after...)')
('Feri', "(And he left the village earlier, too, didn't he?)")
('Van', '(Maybe he realized he was being followed.<br/>Or maybe...)')
('Van', "We got our own business to take care of, but we'll<br/>keep an eye out for him.")
('Van', 'Should we just tell the local officer if we find him?')
('Mayor Weng', 'Yes, that would be much appreciated.')
('Mayor Weng', 'I do apologize for having embroiled you in all of this.')
('Giovanna', 'Ah, pardon me!')
('Giovanna', "I've heard that you take jobs like bracers do, yes?")
('Giovanna', "I've got a bit of a problem, and I need some help...<br/>Would you be willing to hear me out?")
('Van', "Sure, but bear in mind I ain't a bracer. I do a job if I<br/>feel like it.")
('Van', 'And I charge more than they do, too. You good<br/>with that?')
('Giovanna', 'Of course. Just as long as the price is still reasonable.')
('Van', "Easy. Doubt I'll need to charge you too much—it'll<br/>just depend on how complicated the job is.")
('Giovanna', "Thank you very much! You see, I'm stumped on what<br/>to do...")
('Giovanna', "I've been trying to make soba noodles, and they're just<br/>not turning out right. Someone from the city like<br/>yourself might know what I'm doing wrong.")
('Feri', 'Soba noodles...?')
('Agnès', 'A dish made from buckwheat flour, kneaded and cut<br/>into noodles.')
('Agnès', 'I recall from a book that soba noodles are popular in<br/>Eastern cuisine—Far Eastern, specifically.')
('Van', 'Bingo. You two ever had any, by chance?')
('Van', "It's popular street food back in the capital. Has its<br/>fans, for sure.")
('Van', "Pretty simple to make, but it's got a really deep flavor<br/>and it smells like nothin' else.")
('Feri', "Is it really...? Dang it, now I'm hungry!")
('Giovanna', 'I felt the same when the mayor told me about it the<br/>other day.')
('Giovanna', 'So I figured I might as well try to make some myself<br/>for the harvest festival.')
('Giovanna', 'I went around and asked the villagers for advice, since<br/>some of them do know about those sorts of recipes.')
('Giovanna', "But, well...it's been a bit of a flop. I haven't been able<br/>to get the flavors right.")
('Agnès', 'The harvest festival... I think I read an article about it<br/>in the paper.')
('Agnès', "Right, now I remember. They celebrate every<br/>autumn, right? That would mean this year's is right<br/>around the corner.")
('Van', "So, umm...I ain't exactly a cook.")
('Van', "But I can try and give you some pointers based on the<br/>soba I've had in the capital.")
('Giovanna', 'I think that would be a big help, since you have that<br/>point of reference. Hearing about new experiences<br/>from new people is really interesting to me.')
('Giovanna', 'Thank you for hearing me out!')
('Agnès', "Your thoughts, Van? She's eager for help, but...")
('Giovanna', 'Could you help me get this soba recipe down pat?')
('Giovanna', 'Anything would do, even basic tips. Let me know if<br/>you have the time.')
('Agnès', "Your thoughts, Van? She's eager for help, but...")
('Van', "Sorry, we got other business. If we find the time, we'll<br/>stop by and help.")
('Giovanna', "I see. Well, I'll figure something else out, then.")
('Giovanna', 'If you find the time, please consider lending me<br/>a hand.')
('Van', "(Not really a job for a spriggan, but we've got<br/>the time...)")
('Van', "All right, I'll take it on.")
('Van', 'I always make sure to do the job right, so I want some<br/>good soba outta this.')
('Giovanna', "Oh, thank you so much! I'll do my best!")
('Feri', "I'm getting excited for some noodles myself!")
('Feri', 'So, where do we start with this?')
('Van', 'Good question.')
('Van', "So, you said you tried to make some, and it didn't go<br/>so hot?")
('Van', "What about them didn't come out right?")
('Giovanna', 'Well, the flavor was off, and so was the appearance.')
('Giovanna', "The dough turned out powdery when I was cutting it,<br/>like it wasn't put together very well.")
('Giovanna', "It took me so much effort to cut it that I just sort of...<br/>mangled the dough. The result didn't even look<br/>like noodles.")
('Giovanna', "The outside was all soggy and wet, but the inside was<br/>still chalky. It didn't soak evenly at all.")
('Agnès', 'That implies something might have gone wrong<br/>when making the dough...')
('Agnès', "Perhaps there's more to making it than ordinary<br/>bread dough.")
('Giovanna', 'And then, the flavoring sauce. I tried to mix it up and<br/>make a flavor more familiar to the villagers here.')
('Giovanna', 'So I ended up using basil as my base...')
('Giovanna', "It wasn't...inedible, per se, but it just didn't seem<br/>quite right.")
('Van', 'Yeah, sounds like you leapt before you looked there.<br/>Best to stick to the recipe.')
('Giovanna', "Well, yes, you're right.")
('Van', "So there's a lot to unpack here...")
('Van', "But before we can dive in, we'll need to figure out<br/>how to make the stuff ourselves.")
('Feri', 'So, you said you learned about the dish from some of<br/>the villagers, right?')
('Giovanna', 'Ah, yes. Mostly from Mayor Weng and Motona—<br/>they were a great help.')
('Giovanna', 'Both can trace their roots to the East, so they had a<br/>general idea of how the recipe went.')
('Van', "Well, that's as good a place to start as any.")
('Van', "Feel free to kill some time until we're done<br/>asking around.")
('Giovanna', 'Of course. Thank you for your help!')
('System', 'Quest Feasts from the East started!')
('Mayor Weng', "I see. You're helping Giovanna with her soba efforts?")
('Mayor Weng', "I'm sorry to hear that she's having trouble with<br/>the recipe... I suppose my advice wasn't much help.")
('Mayor Weng', "But I hope you'll be able to point her in the<br/>right direction. Thank you for helping her.")
('Van', "'Preciate it, but let's hold off on the thanks until we<br/>get the recipe done right.")
('Van', "We ain't exactly experts, so we need to make sure we<br/>know what we're doing first.")
('Mayor Weng', 'Haha! Measure twice, cut once, indeed.')
('Mayor Weng', 'I believe I might be able to give some tips regarding<br/>soba sauce.')
('Mayor Weng', 'I remember my mother would sometimes make soba<br/>noodles for a young me...')
('Mayor Weng', 'She showed me how to make the sauce once—it<br/>combines a soup stock and a spice blend for flavor.')
('Mayor Weng', 'The blend is usually a combination of Eastern spices<br/>and flavorings...')
('Mayor Weng', '...which are then added to a soup stock of<br/>your choosing.')
('Mayor Weng', 'Soba stock traditionally uses either kelp or<br/>dried bonito.')
('Mayor Weng', 'But as I understand, you can use many other<br/>ingredients, like sardines, vegetables, or<br/>shiitake mushrooms.')
('Feri', "Hmm... There's a lot to this, isn't there?")
('Van', 'There is, yeah. From what Giovanna told us about<br/>her first crack at it...')
('Van', '...the soup stock was probably outta whack.')
('Agnès', "Yes, she certainly didn't use kelp nor bonito.")
('Agnès', "I don't quite know what she used instead...")
('Van', 'We can ask her later.')
('Agnès', 'Thank you for your insight, Mayor Weng!')
('Mayor Weng', 'Oh, my pleasure. I see some wonderful soba in<br/>my future!')
('Van', "Right... Think we're about done with the questioning.")
('Feri', "I think I've got an idea of how to make them now!")
('Agnès', 'So, should we inform Giovanna?')
('Van', 'Maybe... Or, no. I kinda wanna put our own twist on<br/>the recipe.')
('Agnès', 'What would that something be?')
('Van', "A secret spice, that's what. I think Giovanna had the<br/>right idea, tryin' to shake things up. Just the<br/>wrong execution.")
('Van', 'Should be some stuff we could use around here for a<br/>more local flavor.')
('Van', "The creek's probably our best bet.")
('Feri', "I'm not sure what kind of spices we could find, but if<br/>they would help make the noodles taste better, then<br/>let's do it!")
('Van', "Let's give it a crack and see what we come up with.")
('Agnès', 'Okay!')
('Motona', 'Oh, yes! The soba noodles Giovanna was asking<br/>about, I remember.')
('Motona', "I can see why she's struggling with it—it's hard to<br/>make a dish without knowing how it's supposed<br/>to taste.")
('Motona', 'Granted, my knowledge of it is only tangential.')
('Agnès', 'Oh? How familiar are you with it?')
('Motona', 'As it happens, my family brought buckwheat flour to<br/>this village themselves once upon a time.')
('Motona', 'And we manage the windmill to this day.')
('Motona', 'Being the resident buckwheat experts, we know a<br/>thing or two about recipes that use it—soba included!')
('Van', 'Do you, now?')
('Van', 'I know bits and pieces myself...like how you tend to<br/>get bits of chaff in most doughs, for one.')
('Van', 'That you just kinda roll with, but the legit, top-notch<br/>dough has no chaff at all.')
('Van', "So it stood out to me that Giovanna's dough was<br/>so clean. That's good shit she's usin'.")
('Van', 'For a village this tiny, you guys make some<br/>bomb buckwheat. Color me impressed.')
('Motona', "Haha! Now, you won't get any dough for your<br/>flattery...except buckwheat dough, perhaps.")
('Agnès', 'I see... Is that how that works in this village?')
('Motona', 'At any rate, you can count on me to help out with<br/>the flour!')
('Motona', 'It sounds like the dough is the problem... So, there<br/>are two main ways you can make it.')
('Motona', 'You can just use straight buckwheat and nothing else,<br/>which is called 100% buckwheat dough.')
('Motona', 'Or, you can mix buckwheat with standard wheat<br/>flour, which is easier to work with.')
('Motona', 'You can use 80% buckwheat and 20% wheat to make<br/>80% dough, for example.')
('Feri', "So there's no one buckwheat dough... The<br/>ratio varies. That's pretty tricky...")
('Motona', "The key is keeping the dough as hydrated as possible<br/>when you're kneading it.")
('Agnès', 'That does make sense. Once the dough dries out, it<br/>gets tougher to cut.')
('Van', 'Yeah, that goes for a lot of noodle dishes.')
('Van', "Guess that's why you sub in normal wheat most of the<br/>time—straight buckwheat dough dries out a lot easier.")
('Feri', 'Thank you for filling us in, Motona!')
('Motona', 'Of course. Give my best to Giovanna, will you?')
('Van', 'Right. Got us some good info.')
('Agnès', "I think I've got an idea of how to make them now!")
('Feri', 'So, should we inform Giovanna?')
('Van', 'Maybe... Or, no. I kinda wanna put our own twist on<br/>the recipe.')
('Agnès', 'What would that something be?')
('Van', "A secret spice, that's what. I think Giovanna had the<br/>right idea, tryin' to shake things up. Just the<br/>wrong execution.")
('Van', 'Should be some stuff we could use around here for a<br/>more local flavor.')
('Van', "The creek's probably our best bet.")
('Feri', "I'm not sure what kind of spices we could find, but if<br/>they would help make the noodles taste better, then<br/>let's do it!")
('Van', 'Oh, look at this right here.')
('Feri', "It's...a weed, or something? Is that even edible?")
('Agnès', "I don't believe I've seen a plant like this before.")
('Van', "Heh heh. Yeah, this here is what's called a<br/>'fresh ingredient.' City slickers, take note.")
('Van', "They aren't common in the Central East, so<br/>I imagine you don't see any out there, either.")
('System', 'Van took the plant by the stem and plucked it.')
('Van', 'Bingo. Horseradish.')
('Van', 'Now, Far Eastern spice recipes call for wasabi...')
('Van', "...and while this ain't the same thing, it's still called<br/>'mountain wasabi,' and for good reason. Packs a hell<br/>of a kick.")
('Van', "So yeah, this'll do just fine.")
('Van', 'You shred this up, grind it into a paste, and bam.<br/>Instant winner.')
('Agnès', 'I see...! So this is what raw horseradish looks like.<br/>Interesting!')
('Feri', 'So, is it similar to other kinds of radishes?')
('Van', "Hoo, boy. You don't wanna eat this like other<br/>radishes, no. Might as well kiss your tongue goodbye<br/>if you do.")
('Feri', 'Is it really that strong?')
('Feri', "I'm not a picky eater, you know. I can take it!")
('Agnès', "Heehee... Now I'm eager to try horseradish and soba<br/>noodles both.")
('Agnès', "I think that about does it, then. Let's bring Giovanna<br/>up to speed.")
('System', 'Obtained horseradish!')
('Van', 'Yo. We picked up on a lotta stuff from the villagers.')
('Giovanna', 'Oh! Thank you very much.')
('Giovanna', "If possible, I'd like to try and make another batch,<br/>and you can guide me as I'm making them.")
('Giovanna', 'Would that work for you?')
('Giovanna', 'Could you help me with this batch of noodles?')
('Van', 'Sure thing.')
('Giovanna', "Thank you! Let's move to my kitchen...")
('Giovanna', 'Oh, heavens, I forgot. My house is just a mess<br/>right now!')
('Giovanna', "I'm sorry. Could you give me just a minute to<br/>clean up?")
('Mayor Weng', "What timing! If you're in need of a kitchen, mine is<br/>ready and waiting.")
('Giovanna', 'Ah, Mayor Weng!')
('Mayor Weng', "I thought I'd stop by and see how things were going.<br/>Good that I did!")
('Mayor Weng', "Best to strike while the iron's hot, no? You'd be<br/>welcome to use my kitchen instead of cleaning yours<br/>up first.")
('Giovanna', "Oh, thank you so much! I'll gladly accept.")
('Giovanna', "Let's head for the Mayor's house, then!")
('Giovanna', "I'll just need to stop by my house real quick to grab<br/>some cookware and ingredients.")
('Van', "Sure. We'll help you carry whatever you need.")
('Feri', 'This is getting really exciting!')
('Agnès', "I do look forward to these noodles we'll make!")
('Van', 'Sorry, could you give me a little bit?')
('Giovanna', 'Oh, of course. No rush.')
('Annha', "Well, make yourselves at home! My husband told me<br/>you'll be borrowing our kitchen.")
('Annha', 'Help yourselves to whatever you might need.')
('Mayor Weng', "We'll be upstairs if you need anything from us.<br/>Don't hesitate to bug us if you run into trouble.")
('Annha', "I'm looking forward to seeing how your noodles<br/>come out!")
('Giovanna', "Thank you both so much. I promise they'll be worth<br/>the wait!")
('Giovanna', "Now, then... We have the kitchen, and we have<br/>the ingredients. All that's left is to put it all together!")
('Giovanna', "Do let me know if anything seems off to you—I'm<br/>counting on you!")
('Van', 'Sounds good.')
('Agnès', 'Glad to help!')
('Feri', "Ooh, I can't wait!")
('Giovanna', 'So, first and foremost, the dough.')
('Giovanna', 'I remember that you can use 100% buckwheat OR<br/>you can substitute wheat to make a ratio of<br/>your choosing.')
('Giovanna', "At the time, I figured, 'well, the more buckwheat, the<br/>merrier!', so I just went all in with it.")
('Van', 'So you went for 100%?')
('Giovanna', 'I did, yes.')
('Feri', 'Should we stick with 100% dough, then?')
('Van', "(A 100% dough's great in the right hands, that<br/>I know.)")
('Van', "(But it might be too difficult to work with, especially<br/>when she doesn't know the recipe very well.)")
('Van', 'Not to be pushy, but I think a lower ratio would be<br/>better, like 80-20.')
('Van', "Motona was tellin' me about how 100% dough is<br/>really tricky to work with. Dries out before you<br/>know it.")
('Van', "So adding some standard wheat into the mix should<br/>help when you're kneading it.")
('Giovanna', 'I see... Well, that does make sense.')
('Giovanna', "Let's go ahead and do 80% buckwheat, then...")
('Giovanna', "Now to knead it... Oh, goodness! You're right, it's so<br/>much more hydrated than before. This is much easier!")
('Giovanna', 'This should hold up better when I cut it—I think the<br/>ratio really was the secret!')
('Feri', 'Smells good, too!')
('Agnès', "It's looking great already! I'm excited to see the<br/>completed dish.")
('Giovanna', 'Right. On to the sauce, now.')
('Giovanna', 'I think the stock was where I went wrong last time...')
('Giovanna', "I tried using basil, and it didn't turn out very well.<br/>What would you recommend instead?")
('Van', "(Vegetable stock is well and good. It has its place...but<br/>it's not what I think of when I hear soba.)")
('Van', "(We want something that'll really nail that Eastern<br/>flavor, and for that, I'm thinkin' shrimp.)")
('Van', "Let's try usin' shrimp this time. Mayor said he had<br/>some in his pantry.")
('Van', "Don't imagine they'll have a problem with us<br/>borrowin' some, long as we offer them a bowl.")
('Giovanna', "Shrimp? I see, I see... Let's try that, then!")
('Agnès', "I'll go and find the shrimp for her.")
('Feri', "I'll keep an eye on the pot for when it starts boiling!")
('System', 'Van and company made themselves busy helping<br/>Giovanna with the noodles...')
('System', 'Under their watchful eyes, the dish was<br/>finally assembled.')
('Mayor Weng', 'Ahh, now, this is superb! The smell alone makes my<br/>mouth water.')
('Annha', "So these are proper soba noodles... I've never had<br/>them before, but they look scrumptious!")
('Giovanna', "Heehee, I'm flattered. I couldn't have done it without<br/>all your help.")
('Giovanna', "Now, let's see how it tastes, shall we?")
('Van', "Hell yeah, man. I'm starvin'.")
('Agnès', 'Thank you for treating us!')
('Feri', 'Thanks!')
('System', 'Van and company dug right in...')
('Agnès', 'Oh, wow...!')
('Feri', "It tastes really funny...but in a good way! It's delicious!<br/>Can I have seconds, please?!")
('Van', 'Oh, yeah. The hint of shrimp with that earthy note<br/>from the buckwheat...')
('Van', "That right there is a winner. Five stars, I'd wolf 'em<br/>down again.")
('Agnès', 'I can really taste the natural flavors in this dish—this<br/>is almost like a sample of the entire region.')
('Agnès', "You mentioned this was a Far Eastern recipe?<br/>This stands out even among them... It's unlike<br/>anything I've eaten before!")
('Giovanna', "I really wasn't expecting the flavor profile to be<br/>so complex! It turned out simply wonderful.")
('Mayor Weng', 'This does bring me back... The taste is always so<br/>comforting to me, no matter how long I go<br/>between bowls.')
('Annha', "Mmm... I dare say you've mastered this recipe.")
('Van', 'Make sure you try some of the horseradish, too, hey?')
('Van', "It's freshly shredded, so it'll really light up your<br/>taste buds.")
('Agnès', 'Oh, good point. I might as well give it a try.')
('Agnès', 'I wonder how it might complement the noodles...')
('Feri', 'You told us just a little bit, right?')
('Feri', "I don't see the harm in adding a little more. I can take<br/>the spiciest of Central Eastern recipes, so this'll<br/>be cake!")
('System', 'Agnès and Feri decided to try the horseradish with<br/>their noodles...')
('Feri', 'Mmph?!')
('Feri', "What IS that?! It's not just spicy—I can't even taste<br/>the noodles anymore!")
('Feri', "I really don't like that. I prefer the noodles<br/>by themselves.")
('Agnès', "Goodness, this is strong, indeed. I imagine that's to<br/>do with how fresh it is.")
('Agnès', "It's acidic at first, but the aftertaste is quite pleasant.<br/>I can see the appeal, it's just an...acquired taste.")
('Van', "Heh. Yep, it's a very mature flavor. Not for the faint<br/>of heart, but once you try it, it hooks you.")
('Van', "You don't like it, though, that ain't a problem.<br/>You can just have it as is, instead—the buckwheat's<br/>plenty flavorful on its own.")
('Feri', 'Ugh... Why do I feel like I just lost a fight...?')
('Agnès', "Van is...quite the seasoned eater, isn't he?<br/>There's something admirable about that.")
('System', 'Appetites thoroughly whetted, the group made quick<br/>work of their soba noodles.')
('Giovanna', "Thank you all so much! I'm glad I was able to do the<br/>recipe justice.")
('Giovanna', "Now I just need to practice it, so that come festival<br/>time, they'll be even tastier!")
('Van', "Lookin' forward to it.")
('Agnès', "I'm glad I got to try Far Eastern cuisine for myself.<br/>This really was delicious!")
('Feri', 'Thank you very much for the meal, Giovanna!')
('System', 'Quest Feasts from the East completed!')
('System', 'Earned')
('System', 'Received')
('Kyle', 'Th-Thief! THIEF! He stole my bike, the bastard!')
('Agnès', 'Are you all right?!')
('Kyle', "Y-Yeah, I'm okay, just... This guy came walking up to<br/>me just now. Middle-aged, but I couldn't really catch<br/>his face.")
('Kyle', "He muttered something about needing to 'get away in<br/>a hurry,' and then he just...he nicked my bike!")
('Kyle', "Son of a... It's more than a bike to me! He's gonna<br/>pay for this!")
('Agnès', "That's just incorrigible...! Van, we should give chase!")
('Feri', "But wait. Wouldn't this count as a job? Do we need<br/>to get an agreement first?")
('Van', "Normally this'd be police work... Normally.")
('Van', "But who knows how long their response time<br/>might be. We're right here, and they're not.")
('Van', "Yo. Got a sec? We're a group called<br/>Arkride Solutions.")
('Van', 'I can get your bike back, for a price.')
('Kyle', 'Er... What kind of price...?')
('Kyle', "Oh! You're the ones who saved the bus from those<br/>monsters, aren't you...?")
('Kyle', "Then...yes, please! I'll hire you.")
('Kyle', "That bike means the world to me—we've crisscrossed<br/>the whole country together on my fishing trips.")
('Kyle', "If you can catch up to him and get it back, then I'll...")
('Kyle', "I'll pay you whatever you want! I don't have much,<br/>but I won't have ANYTHING without my bike!")
('Agnès', "Let's, then!")
('Van', "Well, heh. Was thinkin' about scourin' the<br/>highway, anyway. Convenient little excuse we've<br/>got here.")
('Van', "Let's hit the road, gang! Might still be able to catch<br/>him on foot.")
('Feri', 'Okay!')
('Agnès', "Let's be off!")
('System', 'Quest A Burgled Bicycle started!')
('Kent', "It'll be okay, Annie...")
('Kent', 'I just know Lashkar will find him! He has to!')
('Annie', 'Yeah... I know, I just...')
('Feri', "Hmm? What's wrong? Are you okay?")
('Kent', "Nero's gone missing...")
('Agnès', 'Who is Nero?')
('Annie', "Our kitty... He's gray, and he has these huge,<br/>round eyes.")
('Annie', "We went out for a walk, but he ran off somewhere,<br/>and he hasn't come back...")
('Kent', "He's always back by now... I hope he didn't get<br/>into trouble...")
('Agnès', "I can understand why you're worried... I hope he<br/>didn't stray too far.")
('Van', "Makes sense that he'd wanna roam around, but still.<br/>The outside ain't so safe anymore.")
('Van', 'You got any ideas where he mighta gone?')
('Annie', 'Umm...')
('Annie', 'Well, today, he was acting really funny.')
('Annie', "His hair was standing up on its own, like he was<br/>scared of something... I couldn't get him to relax.")
('Kent', 'Yeah, he was really on edge. I dunno why, though...')
('Kent', "Man, I'm sorry, Annie. I should've listened to you<br/>and come back home sooner...")
('Annie', "It's okay, Kent... It's not your fault.")
('Annie', "I should've just brought him back inside...")
('Van', "So kitty got spooked and ran off, is that right?<br/>(That's...interesting.)")
('Kent', 'Yeah! Can you help us look for Nero, mister?')
('Annie', "Lashkar's looking, too, but he could really use<br/>your help!")
('Feri', 'I wanna help them, Van... Can we?')
('Van', "Yeah, that's a problem...")
('Annie', "My cat, Nero... He's gone missing.")
('Annie', "Lashkar is searching for him, too, but I'd be really<br/>happy if you could help him.")
('Van', "Got'cha...<br/>(Yeah, I'm a cynical bastard, but even I don't have the<br/>gall to refuse this one.)")
('Van', "All right. We'll find him for you.")
('Annie', 'Yay! Thank you so much!')
('Kent', 'Thank you, nice people!')
('Feri', "Aww, heehee. Couldn't refuse this one, huh, Van?")
('Van', "This ain't really our kind of job, but I guess I can file<br/>it under investigative work.")
('Van', "The part about the cat actin' weird stuck out to me.")
('Agnès', 'I agree, that struck me as odd.')
('Agnès', 'So where should we start looking?')
('Feri', "We should probably find the person who's already out<br/>there searching. Lashkar, right?")
('Annie', "Umm... Sorry, I don't know where Lashkar would be<br/>looking right now.")
('Van', 'Well, guess we gotta search for both, then.')
('Kent', "Okay! We'll look around places where we play a lot!")
('Annie', 'Please be okay, Nero...!')
('Van', "Don't you worry, kiddo. I always make sure the job's<br/>done right.")
('Van', "Sorry. Timing's not great... I'll let you know if I get<br/>the time.")
('Annie', "Okay... I'll wait here.")
('System', 'Quest Cat Gone Astray started!')
('Feri', 'Ah! I sense something nearby!')
('Nero', 'Hiss!')
('Agnès', "He does indeed appear on edge... We shouldn't risk<br/>getting close—we'd likely just spook him away.")
('Van', "Be nice if we had a treat or somethin'...")
('Van', "C'mon. Here, kitty, kitty. We're not gonna hurt ya.")
('Feri', "Let's take you back to your owner, okay?")
('Agnès', 'Annie and Kent are worried sick about you!')
('Nero', '...')
('Nero', 'Rawr! Hisssss!')
('Feri', 'Shoot, he ran off...')
('Van', 'He seemed fine, just scared out of his mind.')
('Agnès', "He's too wary of people right now...but maybe if we<br/>keep after him, he'll get accustomed to us?")
('Lashkar', "You're not gonna catch him that way!")
('Van', 'Huh? Oh, you Lashkar? We heard you were looking<br/>for Nero, too.')
('Lashkar', 'Yeah, Annie filled me in. She said you guys<br/>were helping.')
('Lashkar', 'That said, I know that cat a whole lot better than<br/>you do.')
('Lashkar', "Don't get mad if I bring him home instead, got it?")
('Agnès', "Well, if anything, that would make me quite happy.<br/>Let's collaborate instead of compete, okay?")
('Van', "Yeah, it ain't a competition. You got a plan for<br/>catchin' him?")
('Lashkar', 'Heh! You bet I do.')
('Lashkar', "I've dealt with him a bunch of times, so I know all<br/>his tricks.")
('Lashkar', 'Just gotta catch him soon so Annie can calm down.')
('Lashkar', 'Right, good luck, guys! You got this!')
('Lashkar', 'Heh heh... Nailed it. That sounded like a real bracer,<br/>I know it!')
('Feri', "And he's gone... He's a bundle of energy, isn't he?")
('Agnès', 'And he seems to think aloud, too.')
('Agnès', 'I guess he aspires to be a bracer? He certainly has<br/>the dedication to be one—I wish him the best.')
('Van', "Well, if he's actually got a plan, it'd be best to just<br/>leave him to his own devices.")
('Van', "For now, let's just tail him and see how he does.")
('Van', "There's the little scamp.")
('Lashkar', 'Oh, you guys had the same idea?')
('Lashkar', "Heh, I'm impressed you kept up with me. And you're<br/>not even bracers!")
('Lashkar', "Guess you're the talk of the town for a reason.<br/>I wasn't expecting you to walk the walk, too!")
('Agnès', "Ah, look over there! Nero's up on that roof...!")
('Lashkar', "Yeah, he likes to climb stuff when he's scared.")
('Lashkar', "I dunno what he's so scared of, but you must've<br/>startled him when you came up.")
('Lashkar', "I figured he probably went and climbed up a house<br/>again, and that led me right to him! How's that for<br/>detective work?")
('Van', "Well, credit where it's due—you had a pretty good<br/>guess, there. We wouldn't've known.")
('Feri', "All right. I'll climb up on the roof, then!")
('Lashkar', 'Wha—?! Hey, no fair, I found him first!')
('Lashkar', "Don't you go hogging the glory. I can climb it, too!")
('Feri', "E-Er... Sorry. I didn't mean to...")
('Van', "Really rarin' to go, huh? All right, show us<br/>what'cha got.")
('Van', "We'll be down here. Don't break a leg, okay?")
('Lashkar', "Sure! I'll get this done like a real bracer, just<br/>you watch!")
('System', 'Lashkar received permission from the homeowner to<br/>scale their house.')
('Lashkar', 'Whoa...!')
('Agnès', "Lashkar, are you okay? Don't push yourself!")
('Lashkar', "I-I'm fine! Leave it to me!")
('Lashkar', 'Come on, Nero. Time to come home, okay?')
('Nero', 'Mrr...!')
('Lashkar', "See, I've got your favorite toy here, and some<br/>catnip, too.")
('Lashkar', "I dunno what made you so scared, but you're<br/>safe now. C'mere!")
('Nero', 'Mrrraw...')
('Nero', 'HISS!')
('Lashkar', 'Ack!')
('Feri', 'Oh, no! He was so close...')
('Van', "If he'd come down, we'd have a shot at him...")
('Lashkar', "I almost had him... I thought this time it'd work<br/>for sure!")
('Lashkar', "I just can't get Nero to calm down... Am I still not cut<br/>out for this stuff?")
('Van', "This ain't the first time you've found him today?")
('Lashkar', "Yeah... I've found him lots of times so far, but he just<br/>keeps running away.")
('Lashkar', "Normally he'd go right for his toy—that used to work<br/>every time.")
('Lashkar', "But he's just super aggressive today, and I don't<br/>know why...")
('Lashkar', 'He has to be getting tired by now. We need to get<br/>him home before he puts himself in danger.')
('Feri', 'Lashkar...')
('Agnès', "We can't give up yet. Let's work together this<br/>time, okay?")
('Van', "If we all can surround him, he won't have anywhere<br/>to run.")
('Lashkar', "I get it! What's that called, umm... Divide<br/>and conquer?")
('Lashkar', "Guess I gotta just suck it up and let you guys help...<br/>Okay! Let's find him together.")
('Lashkar', "He just got spooked out of his high ground, so he<br/>knows that won't work anymore. Let's try searching<br/>lower to the ground next!")
('Van', "Right, makes sense. Let's split up, and we can meet<br/>up wherever we find him.")
('Feri', "Yeah! This time we'll catch him!")
('Agnès', 'Ah! Over there, underneath the bench...!')
('Van', 'Yup. Suspect numero uno.')
('Feri', "I'll go get him, then!")
('Lashkar', 'I see... Nero has nowhere to run like this.')
('Lashkar', 'But what now? Do we just move in slowly?')
('Agnès', 'Good question... I think it might be better if at least<br/>one of us hangs back to catch him.')
('Agnès', 'Lashkar, can you back us up?')
('Lashkar', '...Heh, you bet I can! Just watch!')
('Van', 'Okay, we ready?')
('Lashkar', 'Yep!')
('Lashkar', "C'mon, Nero, it's past your bedtime. Let's get you<br/>back home where it's safe.")
('Nero', 'Meowr... Mrowwwww...')
('Lashkar', "C'mere! Right—")
('Lashkar', 'H-Hey, no! Nero!')
('Feri', "Shoot, he's gone...")
('Lashkar', 'No...! What do we do now?!')
('Lashkar', "He's going for the hills over there! What if he runs<br/>into monsters?!")
('Lashkar', 'No, no, no, this is all my fault...!')
('Van', "Calm down, bud. Don't throw in the towel yet.")
('Van', 'Long as we can still find him, we can bring him back.')
('Van', "And from the looks of it, he's clever enough to keep<br/>himself out of trouble, anyway.")
('Lashkar', "You're right...")
('Feri', "Just keep calm. We'll bring him back, we promise!")
('Agnès', "Lashkar, I think it might be best if you take a break to<br/>cool down, yourself. We'll handle the case from<br/>here, okay?")
('Lashkar', 'All right... Be careful, okay?')
('Van', 'Always. See ya soon.')
('Van', "Right, let's make for the hills. We can't let the bugger<br/>get too far.")
('Annie', 'Thank you so much, everyone...!')
('Annie', "I love Nero so much... I'm so glad he's safe!")
('Kent', "*sniffle* Don't make us worry like that again,<br/>you twerp!")
('Nero', 'Mrrew...')
('Agnès', "He does look like he's calmed down now.")
('Van', 'Not sure what got him so anxious in the first place...<br/>You two should keep an eye on him in case it<br/>happens again.')
('Van', "It's good we were around to help this time. If he gets<br/>on edge like that again, find an adult to help<br/>out, yeah?")
('Kent', 'Okaaay...')
('Annie', 'Oh, right! I got this for you as thanks.')
('Annie', "It's not much, but...here you go!")
('System', 'Received <br/> and <br/>.')
('Feri', 'Wow, thanks!')
('Annie', 'And this is for you, Lashkar.')
('Annie', 'I made this little charm a while ago myself. Umm...')
('Annie', 'I meant to give it to you, but I never had the chance...<br/>Until now, heehee!')
('Lashkar', 'A handmade charm...? F-For me?!')
('Lashkar', "A-Ahem! I, umm... I can't, sorry.")
('Lashkar', "It's my fault that Nero got put in danger...")
('Lashkar', "I don't deserve a reward for what I did... I just don't.")
('Annie', "Well, no, you helped find him! I'm really glad you did<br/>that for me.")
('Annie', 'And you always help me when I need it, Lashkar.')
('Annie', "Just...please, accept it! I'm really happy that you're<br/>my friend.")
('Lashkar', 'I... W-Well, all right. Thank you.')
('Lashkar', "What's this symbol on it...? Is that the Bracer<br/>Guild emblem?!")
('Annie', 'Heehee... You always say you wanna be a bracer when<br/>you grow up.')
('Annie', "I think you'll be a great bracer, Lashkar. You're really<br/>nice, and you always give it your best shot.")
('Annie', "I'll always be there to cheer you on, so...")
('Annie', "I hope you'll become a great bracer, so you can help<br/>me whenever I need it!")
('Lashkar', "...Y-Yeah! I'll be a good bracer, just you watch!")
('Kent', 'Aww, your face is red as a tomato! Heehee!')
('Feri', 'Good for you, Lashkar!')
('Agnès', "Aww, that's really charming. Best of luck on your<br/>journey, Lashkar!")
('Van', "Heh. Man, it's like this place came right out of a<br/>story book. Nothin' wrong with that, though.")
('Lashkar', "Wha...? H-Hey, don't look at me like that!")
('Lashkar', 'But, umm...thank you. I really owe you for the help.')
('Lashkar', "Thanks a bunch. I won't forget what you did!")
('System', 'Quest Cat Gone Astray completed!')
('Van', 'So where is this...? Creil Village?')
('Risette', 'Correct. Our records indicate that this dataset was<br/>generated two months ago.')
('Risette', "This reflects the village's state upon your accepting<br/>Ms. Al-Fayed's request.")
('Van', "Really, now? So you used somethin' like geographical<br/>data to make this copy of the village?")
('Van', "Man, your tech just keeps throwin' curveballs at me.")
('Van', "Hell, even the villagers are goin' through<br/>their motions... It's like some kinda memory quartz.")
('Risette', "Due to the high information density in these settings,<br/>the fine details aren't perfectly accurate. Do<br/>pardon that.")
('Van', "Wouldn't've noticed if you didn't point it out.<br/>This was before you tagged along anyway.")
('Risette', 'Indeed it was. I see now that this village is quite the<br/>homely place.')
('Risette', "Though we haven't implemented audio emulation<br/>quite yet, I can almost hear the ambience of this<br/>village already.")
('Van', 'Yeah... Backwater through and through, and all the<br/>beauty that comes with.')
('Van', 'That reminds me, the village is hosting their harvest<br/>festival soon.')
('Van', "Bet they'll dress the place up nice and pretty for that.")
('Risette', 'I see... I would be interested in participating myself,<br/>some day.')
('Risette', 'Now, let us advance to the next memory.')
('System', "Van's pickup truck is parked here.")
