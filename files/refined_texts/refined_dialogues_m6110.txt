('Feri', 'Okay, this labyrinth is WAY bigger than I expected.')
('Judith', 'For real. And this is just the upper floor...')
('Risette', 'I surmise this place was once an underground<br/>waterway—likely constructed during the Dark and<br/>Middle Ages.')
('Agnès', "It might've been used as an escape route from the<br/>palace back then.")
('Aaron', 'Yeah, probably.')
('Dantès', 'All of the players have now entered through their<br/>designated doors. Very good.')
('Van', 'Dantès!')
('Quatre', "He's using a projection.")
('Risette', 'Indeed. And a shard-based one, by the looks of it.')
('Dantès', "I just confirmed that all participating parties have<br/>completed the game's registration process.")
('Dantès', 'I would like to extend a warm welcome to each and<br/>every team here—all nineteen of you.')
('Agnès', "That's a higher number than I expected.")
('Feri', "It could be a little inflated. It's possible the jaeger<br/>corps split themselves into multiple groups.")
('Dantès', 'You are standing in an underground facility that was<br/>constructed by the former royal family and tweaked<br/>by us for the purpose of this game.')
('Dantès', 'Before the slaughtering can begin, however, there are<br/>a few additional rules we must explain. Care to do the<br/>honors, Melchior?')
('Melchior', 'Ooh, with pleasure! Finally, my time to shine<br/>has arrived! ❤')
('Melchior', 'Welcome to our little game, players! I am positively<br/>teeming with anticipation to get this glorious<br/>bloodbath underway.')
('Melchior', 'But first, there are a few important details you ought<br/>to know.')
('Melchior', 'Take a gander at the keycard in your possession.')
('Melchior', 'That very card serves as unequivocal proof of your<br/>right to partake in our humble little game.')
('Melchior', "We distributed one card to each team. The key to<br/>victory is to steal the other teams' cards...")
('Melchior', '...and bring a set number of them to the doors at the<br/>end of each zone.')
('Melchior', "After that, you will come face to face with the<br/>zone's boss. You must defeat them to advance.")
('Melchior', "So if you honestly believed you could finish this game<br/>without spilling a single drop of blood, then I'm<br/>happy to disappoint! ♪")
('Melchior', 'When a team inevitably loses, they must hand over all<br/>their keycards to the winner and take a bow.')
('Melchior', 'They cannot advance, nor can they interfere with the<br/>remaining players inside the game area.')
('Melchior', "Oh, and don't even think about fleeing the city.<br/>Heavens, no. You will all tremble in fear until the<br/>very last day of the game.")
('Melchior', "Also, while I cannot force you to kill each other, I will<br/>cry if you don't. So for my sake, don't show<br/>any mercy.")
('Melchior', 'I should probably mention the bonus feature we<br/>threw in to add a touch of thrill and suspense.')
('Melchior', 'We placed nuclear bombs in each of the<br/>underground zones!')
('Melchior', "They aren't as potent as our palace bomb, but they're<br/>at least as strong as a shot from a railway gun.")
('Melchior', "If you let even one of them go off, a few thousand<br/>people will soon be knocking on Aidios' door.")
('Melchior', "The bombs are hidden, so you'll have to defeat the<br/>zone boss to disable their activation switch. There's a<br/>time limit in play, so no dilly-dallying!")
('Melchior', 'If you focus solely on disabling the palace bomb, you<br/>may find that Oración will be short of a few districts<br/>at the end of the game.')
('Melchior', 'Now, I know that was a lot for your tiny little brains<br/>to process, but I do hope you at least got the gist of it.')
('Melchior', "We'll be keeping a watchful eye on all of you. We<br/>can't have you breaking any rules, now, can we?<br/>So try to be on your best behavior!")
('Melchior', 'All righty, then! Now that the ground rules have been<br/>laid bare, we can finally start the murdering!')
('Melchior', 'For round one, you will need three keycards to<br/>proceed to the next zone. The first bomb will go off<br/>in exactly three hours.')
('Melchior', 'We spared no expense in preparing this carnival of<br/>carnage, so put on a good show! I want to see piles of<br/>mutilated corpses! ♪')
('Aaron', 'That bastard sure loves the sound of his own voice.')
('Van', "Ugh. The situation's gone from bad, to worse, to shit.")
('Quatre', "That's putting it mildly. I cannot fathom how they<br/>acquired so many explosives...")
('Feri', "If they really are as powerful as a railway gun, then<br/>we're in a LOT of trouble.")
('Risette', 'I imagine Melchior devised that part of the plan.<br/>And unfortunately, we would need more than three<br/>hours to find them on our own.')
('Judith', "I doubt we can tip the police, either. We'd run the<br/>risk of the public finding out about this game.")
('Agnès', 'They planned it all down to the smallest detail...<br/>It makes me sick.')
('Bergard', "I don't disagree, but we should focus our energy on<br/>the task at hand—namely, defeating the bosses of<br/>each zone.")
('Van', "You're right, Master. We shouldn't overthink this.")
('Fie', "Just had a thought. Our group size doesn't really lend<br/>itself to quick-and-easy coordination in fights, and<br/>we're, uh, a little pressed for time.")
('Zin the Immovable', "Got a point there. I think the three of us should do<br/>our own thing in fights. That way, you don't have to<br/>worry about giving orders to everyone.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Actually, maybe you can work more closely with<br/>them, Elaine. You and Van know each other so well,<br/>after all.')
('Elaine', 'I would like that. That was actually my plan from<br/>the start.')
('Van', "Got'cha. No objections from me.")
('Rixia', "Now that I think about it, our group size isn't exactly<br/>conducive to efficient battle coordination. Time is<br/>also a luxury we do not have.")
('Cao', "Agreed. Then for efficiency's sake, I will act on<br/>my own. You do not need to give me any orders.")
('Van', 'Fine by me.')
('Kurogane', 'I just had a thought. Our group size is not conducive<br/>to efficient battle coordination. Time is not on our<br/>side, so perhaps I should act on my own.')
('Shizuna', "That might be for the best. Kurogane can do his own<br/>thing, so you don't have to worry about ordering<br/>him around.")
('Van', 'Fine by me.')
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Thanks to that time limit, we gotta move through<br/>fights quick. No time for coordinating.')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "I think it best if Walter and I act on our own<br/>in battle. Oh, and we can't promise you won't be<br/>caught in the crossfire, so be ever so cautious.")
('Van', "Wow. That's not ominous at all.")
('Van', "There's no telling what's waitin' for us in here, so<br/>keep your eyes and ears open, everyone!")
('Agnès', 'Right!')
('Van', '...?!')
('Agnès', 'Wh-What was that?')
('Arioch', 'Yo. Welcome to the party.')
('Bergard', 'Behind us!')
('Quatre', 'Wha...?!')
('Aaron', 'Gah!')
('Agnès', "I-It's him!")
('Judith', "That's the guy we saw in Longlai!")
('Arioch', "Haha! Damn. It ain't every day I run into someone<br/>who can take one of my attacks head on.")
('Arioch', "You're the real deal, aren'tcha, Roaring Lion?")
('Bergard', 'I cast that name aside long ago.')
('Bergard', 'So the Gardens intend to aid Almata to the last, I see.')
('Arioch', 'Yep. Gotta honor the contract we made with Dantès<br/>and all.')
('Elaine', "What? You're one of the Gardens' overseers?!")
('Cao', "You must be one of the Gardens' overseers, then?")
('Shizuna', "Heheh. I didn't think I'd see you again so soon.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Heh. You've got sharper fangs than that scrawny<br/>mint-haired bitch. I like you.")
('Van', "Arioch the Eradicator, wasn't it?")
('Van', "You this zone's boss?")
('Arioch', "Good thing this ain't a quiz show, 'cause you'd<br/>be wrong.")
('Arioch', "You can think of me as this game's ref. I'm here to<br/>carry out the observational system's will.")
('Arioch', 'That way, when it finds a couple of cheaters like you,<br/>I can deliver a little dose of punishment.')
('Arioch', "I'll give ya some credit, though. The possibility of<br/>teams joinin' up never crossed our minds.")
('Aaron', "Shit. This isn't good.")
('Risette', 'An alliance must be regarded as violation of the rules.')
('Agnès', 'Oh, no!')
('Arioch', "Nah, you're good. If it was, the nuclear device<br/>would've blown ya sky high by now.")
('Arioch', 'If anything, I like the way you think. It takes one hell<br/>of a creative mind to find a loophole in our rules.')
('Arioch', "You're really toein' the line here, though. That's why<br/>you got a penalty on your hands...")
('Arioch', "...and I'm here to deliver it. Good luck! Try not to die<br/>on me, ya hear?")
('Judith', "Urgh! Don't smile like that when you're talking<br/>about murder. It's creepy!")
('Feri', 'Welp. Here he comes!')
('Zin the Immovable', "This is the first wall in our path—and we'll plow<br/>straight through it!")
('Fie', 'Ja!')
('Rixia', 'We will not be defeated!')
('Kurogane', 'We shall not be defeated!')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'Heehee. This should be quite entertaining.')
('Arioch', "Haha! Not bad. You guys've got some fire in you,<br/>that's for sure.")
('Feri', 'Holy smokes! His wounds just closed up!')
('Aaron', "This guy's a monster!")
('Van', 'You think his halberd and armor are artifacts?')
('Bergard', 'Very likely. They could be granting him unlimited<br/>regenerative power.')
('Quatre', 'How is that fair? And you called US cheaters?!')
('Elaine', "Doesn't matter. We've got no choice but to fight!")
('Cao', 'Heh. This might actually pose a challenge for me.')
('Shizuna', 'This is getting interesting. Okay, big guy. Come<br/>at me!')
('Walter the Direwolf', "Hell yeah. Now I'm gettin' pumped. Ready for<br/>round two!")
('Arioch', "Nope. We're done for now.")
('Arioch', "The monitoring system isn't compelling me to<br/>act anymore...")
('Arioch', '...which means the punishment you deserve has been<br/>doled out.')
('Van', "So that's how that works.")
('Agnès', 'The power granted to him must only be reserved for<br/>punishing those who break the rules.')
('Risette', 'The amount of punishment imposed must be relative<br/>to the infraction committed.')
('Arioch', "Here's the takeaway: don't break the rules.")
('Arioch', "Also, if I catch you slackin' in a fight, I'll light a fire<br/>under your asses.")
('Arioch', "Oh, and don't you dare die on me before this is over.")
('Arioch', "I'm happy you're taking part in this, by the way.")
('Arioch', "You said you're an actress, right? One of these days, I<br/>ought to go out and see one of those movie things.")
('Judith', "E-EXCUSE ME?! Are you implying you've never<br/>seen a movie before?!")
('Judith', "That is ridiculous! Do yourself a favor and go to the<br/>theater right NOW! You're better off ditching this<br/>stupid game anyway!")
('Feri', 'Umm, Judith?')
('Quatre', 'Is this really so pressing of an issue?')
('Arioch', "Heheh. I'll think about it.")
('Van', "Good riddance. I don't really care about him not<br/>seein' a movie before, but if he goes to watch one<br/>right now, I wouldn't complain.")
('Judith', "And if he doesn't, I will drag his sorry butt to a<br/>theater seat myself. He has a LOT of catching up<br/>to do!")
('Risette', 'Heehee. Well, if he were to do so, that would be one<br/>less powerful foe to worry about.')
('Agnès', 'Thanks for backing us up, you guys. If not for you, I<br/>doubt we would have stood a chance.')
('Zin the Immovable', "No need to thank us. Helpin' those in need is what<br/>we do.")
('Cao', 'I am honored to have been of service.')
('Shizuna', 'Of course! Happy to help.')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'Whatever. Frankly, that left me a little unsatisfied...')
('Aaron', "I mean, we wouldn't have had to fight him if we'd<br/>never made this alliance in the first place.")
('Aaron', 'But it did help us learn about the penalty system.<br/>Makes me think this might not be the only loophole.')
('Bergard', "And now we know that exposing said loopholes won't<br/>immediately trigger the nuclear weapon. The same<br/>can't be said for flagrant violations, though.")
('Bergard', 'In any event, this was likely intended as a warning—<br/>to stay away from the gray areas of the game.')
('Quatre', "If I were to speculate, I'd say the final judgment call<br/>on penalties will be made by the device overseeing the<br/>game rather than Almata itself.")
('Risette', 'That seems probable. We should keep that possibility<br/>in mind moving forward.')
('Agnès', 'Right...')
('Van', "Anyway, we may've started off on the wrong foot, but<br/>at least we got some useful info out of the deal.")
('Van', "Let's keep moving.")
('Feri', 'Right! We have no time to waste.')
('Viola', 'Testing, testing. This thing on? Can everyone<br/>hear me?')
('Van', 'Oh, great.')
('Aaron', "It's that psychopath!")
('Viola', "My name is Viola. I'm the boss of the upper zone—<br/>which you're all currently in.")
('Viola', "I'm here to inform you that two teams are out of<br/>the running.")
('System', 'Team Zahat has been eliminated.<br/>Team Dolor has been eliminated.')
('Quatre', 'Wh-What?!')
('Judith', 'Already?!')
('Feri', "Team Zahat...? Oh, the Scorpions of Zahat! That's a<br/>jaeger corps that operates in the Central East.")
('Risette', 'And Team Dolor must be referring to the<br/>Dolor Family.')
('Viola', 'Both teams were certainly formidable, but they<br/>quickly ran into foes above their level. Quite unlucky.')
('Viola', 'Oh, well. So it goes.')
('Viola', 'You will be notified like this every time a team<br/>is eliminated.')
('Viola', "Better pick up the pace, my precious little players.<br/>Clock's ticking.")
('Bergard', "Didn't take long for this to turn into a free-for-all.")
('Elaine', 'As expected. I came ready for a fight, anyway.')
('Rixia', "We can't afford to let our guard down for even<br/>a moment.")
('Shizuna', 'Heck yeah. This is gonna be fun!')
('Walter the Direwolf', "Heh. This gonna be just as chaotic as the old man<br/>said it'd be.")
('Van', "No tellin' when we'll run into another team. Try to be<br/>careful, but remember, this is still a race against time.")
('Agnès', "Right. We'll keep that in mind.")
('Zin the Immovable', "Hey, guys. Didn't take long for us to bump into each<br/>other, huh?")
('Van', "So our first opponents are the guild's elites? Great.<br/>Lady Luck ain't smilin' on us today.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Nah. She's doin' me a real favor.")
('Fie', "It hasn't even been three hours since we last met.<br/>And now there's even more of you.")
('Rixia', "It's good to see you again.")
('Shizuna', "So we're up against Zin the Immovable and<br/>Beauty's Blade. Oh, and the Jaeger King's little squirt.")
('Shizuna', 'This ought to be interesting.')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "I'm so very happy for you, Walter. You must be<br/>thrilled to see your old rival again, no?")
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Actually, we ran into each other just the other day.')
('Agnès', '(It seems like they have some history.)')
('Van', '(Yeah. They both studied under the same master.)')
('Zin the Immovable', "I figured we'd cross paths in here sooner or later, but I<br/>didn't think it'd happen so soon.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Not sure whether to call this a stroke of luck or a<br/>bad break.')
('Walter the Direwolf', "Well, that nosy woman ain't here, so I'd normally be<br/>up for havin' our no-holds-barred match...")
('Walter the Direwolf', "...but we're not the stars of the show this time.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "You've got your bracer girls in tow, and I'm part of<br/>the Arkride gang today.")
('Elaine', 'Now, then. How do we want to handle this?')
('Elaine', 'If we defeat you, we will have three keycards in<br/>our possession.')
('Aaron', 'Oh. You took out one of the teams that just got<br/>eliminated, huh?')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Yep. We beat the Dolor Family pretty soundly.')
('Zin the Immovable', "We've had our run-ins with them in the past, but it's<br/>been a while since we last traded blows.")
('Fie', 'It was a short-lived reunion, though.')
('Fie', 'Their numbers have been dwindling ever since<br/>Almata entered the scene.')
('Elaine', 'We handed them over to our coworkers, and they are<br/>delivering them to the police as we speak.')
('Elaine', "However, they will not disclose the nature of<br/>the arrest. We can't let the public learn about<br/>this game.")
('Feri', 'Makes sense.')
('Quatre', 'So the guild sent its very best down here while having<br/>backup above ground for arrests.')
('Zin the Immovable', "Anyway, there aren't any rules that say you have to<br/>fight another team if you encounter them.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'We got some leeway until the first time limit, too.')
('Van', "Yeah. There's no reason for us to duke it ou—")
('Zin the Immovable', "I wasn't finished. Unfortunately for you, we're taking<br/>you out of the game. Right here, right now.")
('Elaine', '...We are?')
('Zin the Immovable', "We have two reasons. First, you're putting the lives of<br/>civilians in jeopardy by dragging them into this.")
('Quatre', '...')
('Agnès', 'Right. You have the bracer code to follow.')
('Zin the Immovable', "Now, I'll be the first to admit that you all look like<br/>you can handle yourselves in a fight...")
('Zin the Immovable', "...but that still leaves reason number two—you've<br/>chosen to ally with Heiyue.")
('Zin the Immovable', "I can't say I approve of you working with the White<br/>Orchid Dragon.")
('Cao', "Oh, dear. Didn't you once say there was room for<br/>negotiations between us? Whatever happened to that?")
('Zin the Immovable', "Yeah, I did say that, but that doesn't apply to<br/>this situation.")
('Zin the Immovable', "...but that still leaves reason number two—you've<br/>chosen to ally with the most dangerous jaeger corps in<br/>the East.")
('Zin the Immovable', "...but that still leaves reason number two—you've<br/>chosen to ally with the society.")
('Zin the Immovable', "And I'm not about to stand aside and let you be<br/>corrupted by them.")
('Fie', 'Zin...')
('Van', "No one's corruptin' anyone. We're the same people<br/>we always were—and always will be.")
('Zin the Immovable', "Sounds like an empty platitude, my friend.<br/>You'll have to back your words up.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'And what better way to prove your point than by<br/>beating us in battle? Show me your indomitable<br/>spirit—with your fists.')
('Van', "Well, I tried. Guess we're doin' this the hard way!")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Why're you like this, man? You don't have to concoct<br/>some lame-ass excuses to throw down the gauntlet.")
('Zin the Immovable', "Course I do. After all, I have the honor of the Bracer<br/>Guild's supporting gauntlet to abide by.")
('Zin the Immovable', "I can't throw it around willy-nilly. we aren't exactly<br/>free to do whatever we want—unlike you snakes.")
('Fie', "I'm sure the adults can handle themselves, but the<br/>kids are more susceptible to suggestion.")
('Fie', "I trust Rixia, but I can't say the same for Cao.<br/>'Suspicious' might as well be his middle name.")
('Cao', 'Oh, my. What did I do to deserve these<br/>unflattering accusations?')
('Rixia', 'Do you even have to ask?')
('Fie', "I doubt you're a good influence, Divine Blade<br/>of Silver.")
('Fie', "I've heard stories about you. You trained under the<br/>same master as Rean—and had a brief confrontation<br/>with him not too long ago.")
('Shizuna', "Heehee. So he's been telling all his little friends<br/>about me? How flattering.")
('Shizuna', "Oh, and I've heard about you, too. Did you know I<br/>met your boss once? I am VERY interested to see just<br/>what his little squirt is made of!")
('Fie', "Call me 'little squirt' one more time and I will<br/>end you.")
('Fie', 'And those two society creeps are a bad influence.')
('Elaine', "If we're doing this, then I'm going all out.<br/>Fair warning.")
('Elaine', 'Your group has the advantage in numbers, so if you<br/>lose to us here, then, chances are, you would have<br/>never made it to the end.')
('Elaine', "Hope you're ready, Van.")
('Van', "Always. Let's do this thing!")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Darn. We lost this one.')
('Walter the Direwolf', "Well, that was unsatisfying. You should've gone down<br/>way quicker, considering how outnumbered you were.")
('Walter the Direwolf', 'You better join me for a real one-on-one later.')
('Zin the Immovable', "Already itching for more, huh? Well, if I'm free, sure.")
('Bergard', 'Despite the odds, they put up a good fight.')
('Risette', 'Indeed. Though I expected as much from the elites of<br/>the Calvardian guild.')
('Cao', "We're quite lucky we have such reliable companions.<br/>The two of us may have been overwhelmed had we<br/>faced them alone.")
('Rixia', "I can't deny that. All three are exceptionally strong.")
('Kurogane', 'I knew Zin the Immovable would pose a challenge,<br/>but the other two were quite formidable as well.')
('Shizuna', 'Yeah. The little squir—I mean, Sylphid was stronger<br/>than I anticipated.')
('Fie', "Well, that sucked. I thought we'd put up more of a<br/>fight, but you guys are tough as nails.")
('Fie', 'That, and we were badly outnumbered. Feels like we<br/>never had a chance to begin with.')
('Van', "Hey, you were the ones who picked a fight with us.<br/>Should've known what you were signing up for.")
('Van', '(Although, that grizzly bear still looks like he could<br/>go another round or two.)')
('Van', '(Same goes for Elaine.)')
('Van', "(Well, the silver lining in all this is that we won't have<br/>to worry about the surface. They can take care of<br/>things there.)")
('Elaine', '*sigh* Actually, this works out perfectly for me.')
('Agnès', 'Huh? Did you say something?')
('Elaine', 'Oh, yes. Congratulations. Victory is yours.')
('Zin the Immovable', 'And so are these cards.')
('System', 'Received two keycards.')
('System', 'Team Bracer has been eliminated.')
('Van', "Score. Can't believe we managed to nab two of these<br/>at once.")
('Zin the Immovable', "You all have thoroughly convinced me that you won't<br/>be swayed by those dubious forces...")
('Zin the Immovable', '...and that these cards are in safe hands. I trust you.')
('Van', "We'll make sure that trust isn't misplaced.")
('Van', "You sure it's okay for the guild to be pullin' out this<br/>early, though?")
('Zin the Immovable', "The lives of 280,000 people hang in the balance.<br/>This isn't the time to be worrying about saving face.")
('Zin the Immovable', "Besides, we won't be sitting idly by—we'll be holding<br/>down the fort outside.")
('Fie', "If you take down any major baddies, call us up.<br/>We'll come back down and take them to the station.")
('Fie', "The rules only specified that we can't interfere with<br/>the 'remaining' players. Catch my drift?")
('Elaine', "I suppose you're right. We can't help you directly...")
('Elaine', '...but we have other means of backing you up.')
('Feri', 'Wow. You guys sure are reliable!')
('Aaron', 'And crafty, too. They had a contingency plan<br/>all along.')
('Agnès', "Thank you for your support. We're counting on you!")
('Zin the Immovable', "And we'll be counting on you as well—to win this<br/>thing in our stead and bring some villains to justice.<br/>Can you do that for us?")
('Van', 'Sure thing, big guy.')
('Shizuna', '...Wait.')
('Shizuna', "I can sense two groups beyond this door—and they're<br/>locked in combat.")
('Feri', 'Could it be...!')
('Feri', "One of them's the Kruga. I'm sure of it!")
('Feri', "And I'm almost positive the other one's<br/>the Eisenschild.")
('Feri', 'Wait!')
('Agnès', "What's wrong?")
('Feri', "I can sense a lot of people on the other side of this<br/>door—and they're locked in a fierce battle!")
('Van', "Oh, damn. Wonder who we're dealin' with?")
('Feri', "One of them's the Kruga for sure.")
('Feri', "And I'm almost positive the other one's<br/>the Eisenschild.")
('Judith', "What should we do, then? You're from one of those<br/>groups, right?")
('Feri', '...Yeah.')
('Aaron', "Well, make up your mind quick. It won't be long<br/>before they notice we're here.")
('Van', "Don't think I need to spell out what the worst-case<br/>scenario is.")
('Van', "A three-way brawl wouldn't be a fun time. And if<br/>they ganged up on us, we'd be totally screwed.")
('Fie', "Yup. Taking on one jaeger corps would be<br/>challenging enough, but two at once? That's just<br/>asking for trouble.")
('Rixia', 'Our odds of winning in that scenario would be<br/>quite low.')
('Shizuna', 'I say we go for it. I bet I can take them down with<br/>one hand tied behind my back.')
('Van', "Somehow I doubt that. Anyway, you ain't callin' the<br/>shots here, Princess. I am.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'I vote to try, anyway. I would rather enjoy<br/>the challenge.')
('Van', 'You are one crazy lady. Well, no one else is in favor,<br/>so sorry.')
('Quatre', 'Are there any other alternatives?')
('Van', "There's one—we back one of them up.")
('Van', "That'd make the chance of them turning on us nil.<br/>It'd also make it way easier to win.")
('Agnès', "A sound plan. Well, if we're backing one of them,<br/>then it has to be the Kr—")
('Feri', "No, it doesn't have to be them. Please, don't let me be<br/>a factor in your decision.")
('Agnès', 'B-But...')
('Risette', "Are you certain you're all right with fighting your<br/>own people?")
('Feri', "Positive. After all, I'm not with them right now.<br/>I'm with you guys.")
('Feri', 'And if I have to treat them like enemies on the<br/>battlefield, then so be it.')
('Feri', "I won't let my emotions cloud my judgment.<br/>Doing so would be dishonoring the Warriors of<br/>Kruga name.")
('Feri', "So don't worry about me. I want you to choose based<br/>on what you think is best.")
('Agnès', '...')
('Van', "Well, if you're sure.")
('Feri', 'Just so you know, the Warriors of Kruga despise<br/>groups like Almata who involve civilians in<br/>their conflicts.')
('Feri', "I have no clue who they're working for now...")
('Feri', "...but my guess is they're here to put a permanent end<br/>to Almata.")
('Risette', 'I do know that the Eisenschild serves as a law<br/>enforcement agency for the free cities.')
('Risette', 'Unfortunately, I have no inkling as to who their<br/>current employer is.')
('Risette', 'If I were to speculate, I would say their goal is to take<br/>Almata into custody rather than execute them.')
('Van', "So one's here to kill, one's here to arrest.")
('Van', "(Which of 'em are we gonna side with?)")
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'Hmm? Is that not...?')
('Commander Geraint', 'That spriggan?!')
('Van', "We're Arkride Solutions—and we're lendin' a hand to<br/>the Warriors of Kruga!")
('Feri', "We'll be fighting at your side, Abi!")
('Vice Chief Hasan', "Hahaha. So, you're proposing a temporary<br/>alliance, eh?")
('Van', "That's right. We're not here to decide who's right or<br/>wrong, but we're takin' a side regardless!")
('Commander Geraint', 'Well, this took a turn for the worse... And you<br/>brought bracers with you, too?')
('Zin the Immovable', "Sorry 'bout this. I'd rather side with you guys than<br/>them, but it wasn't my choice to make.")
('Commander Geraint', 'Well, this took a turn for the worse... And you<br/>brought Heiyue with you, too?')
('Cao', 'Fate is certainly a curious creature, no?')
('Commander Geraint', "Well, this took a turn for the worse... And of all the<br/>people you could've brought along...")
('Shizuna', "Hello! Nice to see you boys again. It's been, what, a<br/>couple weeks now?")
('Commander Geraint', 'Well, this took a turn for the worse... And you<br/>formed an alliance with the society?!')
('Walter the Direwolf', "You guys look tougher than our reinforced jaegers, I'll<br/>give you that.")
('Vice Chief Hasan', "I will leave the regimental commander to you.<br/>We'll take care of the rest!")
('Van', 'Works for me!')
('Commander Geraint', 'The odds are stacked against us, but we will not<br/>be defeated! Our will is ironclad, and our resolve<br/>cannot be broken!')
('Commander Geraint', 'Men, to arms!')
(40451, 'Ja!')
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'The battle is won. Accept your defeat with grace,<br/>Commander Geraint.')
('Commander Geraint', 'I had thought we would emerge victorious, but alas.<br/>It was not meant to be.')
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'Arusha has smiled upon us today—we must give<br/>Her thanks.')
('Commander Geraint', 'Indeed. She was on your side this time.')
('Commander Geraint', 'To the victor goes the spoils.')
('System', 'Geraint handed Hasan his keycard.')
('System', 'Team Eisenschild A has been eliminated.')
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'Glory to the Kruga! Glory to Arusha!')
(40461, 'Yaaaaah!')
('Commander Geraint', 'We have no reason to remain here. Let us withdraw<br/>to the surface!')
(40451, 'Ja!')
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'You have our thanks for your timely support.')
('Vice Chief Hasan', "I'm assuming you do not intend to fight us<br/>here, correct?")
('Van', "Nah. We've got all the keycards we need already.")
('Van', "But if you really wanna try your luck against us, then<br/>I'm game.")
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'Hahaha. No, no. We would rather avoid<br/>back-to-back battles if we can help it.')
('Feri', 'Abi.')
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'I had my eye on you during that fight, Ferida, and I<br/>was very impressed by what I saw.')
('Vice Chief Hasan', "Sending you off to Van's was not a mistake, after all.<br/>He's been treating you well, I hope?")
('Feri', "Uh-huh! They've all been super nice to me!")
('Agnès', '(She seems really happy.)')
('Agnès', "(I'm glad she didn't have to fight them.)")
('Aaron', "(Eh. Small fry could've handled it fine either way.<br/>She's tougher than she looks.)")
('Aaron', "(Though there's no harm in letting kids be kids,<br/>I suppose.)")
('Cao', '(You are no less of a child yourself, you know.)')
('Aaron', '(You wanna fight?)')
('Vice Chief Hasan', "There's one more topic to discuss: the spoils of battle.")
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'We only received one keycard. Would you be<br/>opposed to us having it?')
('Van', "Y'all can take it. Like I said, we've got all the cards we<br/>need—and you fought more of the battle than we did.")
('Vice Chief Hasan', "Very well. But we can't send you away empty handed.")
('System', 'Received the <br/> holo core.')
('System', 'Received <br/>.')
('Vice Chief Hasan', "We will be returning to our base for some rest, so<br/>we'll let you go ahead of us.")
('Van', "'Preciate that.")
('Bergard', "All right, then. We'll be off.")
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'Ferida.')
('Feri', '...?')
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'We fought side by side this time...')
('Vice Chief Hasan', '...but when we next meet, it will likely be as enemies.')
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'When the time comes, you will have to come at us<br/>with everything you have, and I expect you to do the<br/>same for Kasim, should you face him.')
('Feri', '...Understood!')
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'Hmm? Is that not...?')
('Commander Geraint', 'That spriggan?!')
('Van', "We're Arkride Solutions—and we're lendin' a hand to<br/>the Eisenschild!")
('Commander Geraint', "So, you're here to break the stalemate between us?<br/>Excellent. The tide of battle is shifting in our favor!")
('Feri', "I'm going to have to fight you, Abi.")
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'I see. This is certainly a surprise—but perhaps not an<br/>unwelcome one.')
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'This is a prime opportunity to put what you learned<br/>these past few months to the test!')
('Feri', "Right. Get ready, Abi. Because I'm coming at you<br/>with everything I have!")
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'Very good. I would expect no less from my<br/>own daughter...')
('Vice Chief Hasan', '...but I did not foresee you allying with bracers.')
('Zin the Immovable', "We aren't exactly the biggest fans of murder, as you<br/>can well imagine. So we're taking you out of<br/>the game.")
('Vice Chief Hasan', '...but I did not foresee you allying with Heiyue.')
('Cao', 'Fate is certainly a curious creature, no?')
('Vice Chief Hasan', "Well, if it isn't the famous Ikaruga! Your reputation<br/>precedes you.")
('Kurogane', 'Your own fame precedes you likewise.')
('Vice Chief Hasan', '...but I never would have foreseen you allying with the<br/>infamous society!')
('Walter the Direwolf', "You guys look tougher than our reinforced jaegers, I'll<br/>give you that.")
('Commander Geraint', "I'll leave the vice chief to you. We will handle<br/>the rest!")
('Van', 'Works for me!')
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'You will not snuff out our flames so easily!')
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'Victory will be ours for the taking! Men, attack!')
(40462, 'Sir!')
('Commander Geraint', "We've won this round. I suggest you concede.")
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'Very well... I had thought victory was within our<br/>grasp, but it slipped through our fingers this time.')
('Commander Geraint', 'It simply means that Aidios was on our side today.')
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'So it seems.')
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'I believe this is now yours.')
('System', 'Hasan handed Geraint his keycard.')
('System', 'Team Kruga A has been eliminated.')
('Commander Geraint', 'The battle has been decided. Victory is ours!')
(40451, 'Yaaaaah!')
('Vice Chief Hasan', "You've grown, Ferida. I can see that clear as day.")
('Vice Chief Hasan', "Sending you off to Van's was not a mistake, after all.<br/>He's been treating you well, I hope?")
('Feri', "Uh-huh! They've all been super nice to me!")
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'There is much I would like to discuss with you, but<br/>now is not the time. We cannot linger here.')
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'Men, withdraw!')
('Feri', "I'll see you again one day, Abi.")
('Feri', "I won't lie—it'll be hard to face Kasim head on, but<br/>I'll do the best I can.")
('Commander Geraint', 'Your timely aid allowed us to attain victory. You have<br/>our thanks.')
('Commander Geraint', 'Or do you intend to challenge us? Surely not.')
('Van', "Nah. We've got all the keycards we need already.")
('Van', "But if you really wanna try your luck against us, then<br/>I'm game.")
('Commander Geraint', 'Of course not. We would never stoop so low as to<br/>stab a newfound ally in the back.')
('Commander Geraint', 'Though while I wish we could share the spoils, we<br/>only received one keycard...')
('Van', "Y'all can take it. Like I said, we've got all the cards we<br/>need—and you fought more of the battle than we did.")
('Commander Geraint', 'We are in your debt—so perhaps we should pay it off<br/>here and now.')
('System', 'Received the <br/> holo core.')
('System', 'Received <br/>.')
('Commander Geraint', "We will be returning to our base for some rest, so<br/>we'll let you go ahead of us.")
('Van', "'Preciate that.")
('Bergard', "All right, then. We'll be off.")
('Agnès', "We're sorry for making you fight your family, Feri...")
('Feri', "Don't be! I've been wanting to show Abi just how<br/>much I've grown, so that's a huge load off my mind.")
('Feri', "And I'm sure Abi feels the same way.")
('Feri', "Okay, I'm a liiittle sad I couldn't fight alongside<br/>my people...")
('Feri', "...but there'll be plenty of chances to do that in<br/>the future! So I'm good.")
('Agnès', "Okay, then. If you're sure.")
('Van', "You got the right idea. You ain't gonna stop growin'<br/>anytime soon, so you'll be able to impress him even<br/>more next time.")
('Risette', 'I believe this device here is our card reader.')
('Risette', 'The center of this zone awaits us on the other side of<br/>this door.')
('Judith', "We've got all the cards we need to open it, right?")
('Judith', "Then let's show this Almata boss who's boss!")
('Van', "Hold up. Before we charge in guns blazing, I gotta<br/>confirm somethin' first.")
('Feri', 'Confirm what?')
('Van', "That you're all ready for what might happen in there.")
('Aaron', "C'mon, dude. How many times do we gotta tell you<br/>we're ready to risk our lives—")
('Van', "This ain't about risking lives. It's about taking 'em.")
('Quatre', 'What...?')
('Van', "These're the guys who took the lives of everyone in<br/>Creil, and they're prepared to do the same to the<br/>people here. No telling what they'll pull.")
('Van', "Best-case scenario, we go in there, crack some skulls,<br/>and throw 'em behind bars—but the actual outcome<br/>could be much, much uglier.")
('Agnès', 'Oh...')
('Van', "Now, I ain't sayin' you guys have to do the deed.<br/>That'd be my job.")
('Van', "Though even if you don't have their blood on your<br/>hands, you'll still be involved in whatever happens,<br/>and you'll have to live with the guilt.")
('Van', "You sure you're ready for that?")
('Elaine', '(Van...)')
('Fie', "(It's a reasonable thing to ask. We're against killing,<br/>too, but when things are down to the wire...)")
('Zin the Immovable', '(...we place the lives of civilians above all else.)')
('Bergard', "The weight of such an act is heavier than you<br/>could imagine. It's a burden you may have to carry for<br/>the rest of your lives.")
('Bergard', 'There is absolutely no shame in staying behind—')
('Aaron', "Can it, Gramps. Like I was saying earlier—<br/>c'mon, dude.")
('Aaron', "I knew it might go down like this since the very<br/>damn start. Hell, I'll take them out myself if I have to.")
('Feri', 'I feel the same way.')
('Feri', "The lives of so many innocents are at stake here.<br/>I'll do whatever I can to protect them.")
('Risette', 'As your concierge, my duty is to you. Turning away<br/>now would be shirking my responsibilities.')
('Judith', "Listen, I might not always be on the 'right' side of the<br/>law, but that's one line I never dared cross.")
('Judith', "These scumbags, on the other hand, have crossed it<br/>one too many times—so if that's how it has to be,<br/>then so be it.")
('Quatre', "If I'm being perfectly honest, I'm scared. I don't know<br/>how I'd live with myself if the worst came to pass...")
('Quatre', "...but if the nuclear devices go off, that will be the<br/>least of my worries. I'd rather help than do nothing.")
('Agnès', "The Geneses have caused so much pain and suffering.<br/>I don't want their power to be abused any further...")
('Agnès', "...so if that's what it comes to, then I'll handle it.<br/>I'll shoulder that burden with everyone here. So yes,<br/>I'm ready, Van.")
('Van', "Got'cha.")
('Elaine', '...')
('Fie', "Well, there's your answer. Looks like everyone's<br/>on board.")
('Van', 'Guess so, yeah. You guys ready to kick some ass?')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Heh. Always.')
('Cao', 'I assume you are ready, then?')
('Van', "Yeah. We're all set now.")
('Rixia', "Then let's move on. We'll support you as best we can.")
('Kurogane', 'Are you finished?')
('Van', "Yeah. We're good.")
('Shizuna', "Then let's get a move on already.")
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Come on, man. Overprotective much?')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "Heehee. I didn't take you for a family man,<br/>Van, dear. Or perhaps you're more like a<br/>mother hen...")
('Van', "Ah, shut up. Let's just head through the damn door.")
('System', 'Keycards confirmed. The door has been unlocked.')
('Feri', '...!')
('Judith', "Well, guess there's no going back.")
('Viola', "Indeed. There's no way I'd let you leave now—not<br/>when you've kept me waiting ever so long.")
('Viola', "Hah. Why the long faces? You're the first team here!<br/>Rejoice! Turn those frowns upside down.")
('Aaron', 'No can do. Not while the crazy sadist is in the house.')
('Van', 'So is that thing next to you the activation switch for<br/>the bomb?')
('Viola', "Yes, you're right on the mark.")
('Viola', "A shame it'll only kill a measly few thousand.<br/>The one from the palace can wipe out hundreds<br/>of thousands. It's a more impressive toy, to be sure.")
('Quatre', 'Did you just call it...a toy?!')
('Quatre', "It's a weapon of mass destruction—not some tool for<br/>your amusement!")
('Viola', "Oh, but it is. As far as I'm concerned, it's just a child's<br/>plaything—much like the people in this game, in fact.")
('Viola', 'All of you, including the 280,000 in this city, are<br/>nothing more than toy soldiers—fated to be cast into<br/>the fire when broken.')
('Agnès', 'How can you say something so...inhumane?')
('Agnès', 'The people of Creil, Oración, and all the other towns<br/>and cities lead very real lives.')
('Agnès', "You think they don't matter? That their lives hold<br/>no meaning?")
('Agnès', "Well, they do. Every single human life is equal<br/>and precious. They're all—")
('Viola', 'Shut your mouth.')
('Viola', "Kindly take that 'equality' bullshit and shove it.")
('Agnès', '...')
('Viola', 'I can tell you had a decent upbringing just by looking<br/>at you.')
('Viola', "Tell me, have you ever imagined what it'd be like to<br/>go from riches to rags? To have all that privilege<br/>stripped from you in the blink of an eye?")
('Viola', "Well, I hadn't, either...until it really happened to me.")
('Viola', 'Like you, I was once an ignorant little girl—born into<br/>a noble family in a small country in the Central East.<br/>We lived a happy, blissful life...')
('Viola', '...but it all went up in flames. The mad race for<br/>resources and mira in the Central East led my country<br/>and my family to ruin.')
('Viola', 'After that, I just kept falling and falling and falling...')
('Viola', 'I thought I hit the bottom when I was sold to an<br/>organized crime group, but the abyss swallowed me<br/>up and sent me spiraling further down.')
('Viola', "I was trampled on...and violated over and over again.<br/>I'm sure that sort of life is foreign to you,<br/>huh, little girl?")
('Agnès', '...')
('Aaron', "All right, so you had a rough go of it. That still<br/>doesn't mean you get to go around blowing up cities.")
('Viola', "I often think back to when I first heard the news of<br/>that Erebonian prince's marriage.")
('Viola', "When I learned he wedded a Central Eastern orphan,<br/>I couldn't help but laugh.")
('Viola', "She and I are one and the same—yet she lives a life of<br/>royalty while I'm stuck in squalor. How is that fair?")
('Viola', "The answer is that it isn't. This world is rotten to the<br/>core—with injustice ingrained so deep it's become<br/>impossible to root it out.")
('Judith', "And what about those innocent people you're<br/>killing, hmm? What did they ever do to you?!")
('Viola', "Oh, I very much hope they all burn—along with this<br/>wretched world. I've wanted that for so long now.")
('Viola', 'For so, so, soooooo long.')
('Viola', "Nevertheless, I came to realize that wouldn't fully<br/>satiate my desire for revenge...")
('Viola', '...so I clawed my way up the very organization that<br/>abused me. I manipulated my way to the top...')
('Viola', '...and right as I hit the peak, I met the man who<br/>would change my life forever.')
('Viola', 'Gerard Dantès.')
('Viola', 'He brought our organization to its knees—as he does<br/>with all his enemies.')
('Viola', 'Then he brought it under his heel—by subjecting my<br/>allies, my foes, and even me to an all-consuming fear.')
('Viola', "In the face of that fear, everyone is equal—no matter<br/>where you're born, who you are, or what you've done.")
('Viola', "And that's when I realized something: the terror that<br/>man brings to the world...is the ultimate equalizer!")
('Feri', '...')
('Van', 'So, in short, you met the worst possible person at the<br/>worst possible time.')
('Risette', 'I sympathize. The hole in your heart was filled in the<br/>most twisted way possible.')
('Quatre', "I'm beginning to pity you. You've led a hard life.")
('Viola', "I don't want your pity, you damn brats! You know<br/>nothing about us!")
('Viola', "But everyone WILL know true fear very soon.<br/>Our boss' new world is nearly upon us!")
('Viola', "Sadly, you won't be a part of it. Your existence would<br/>be a blight on his world, so I will eradicate you!")
('Risette', 'Wait. Is that...?')
('Agnès', 'This is just like that time under the capital—<br/>when those mafiosos took power-enhancing drugs.')
('Van', "Looks like she got one hell of a boost from 'em, too.<br/>Careful, guys!")
('Viola', "Ahaha! If you thought those weaklings were tough,<br/>you won't last very long against me.")
('Viola', "We combined our research with another's to<br/>attain power beyond our wildest imagination!")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Oh, crap...')
('Elaine', 'Are you referring to that drug from Crossbell?!')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'Oh? Might you be referring to that drug<br/>from Crossbell?')
('Van', "She talkin' about that drug from Crossbell?!")
('Bergard', "Its main ingredient shouldn't exist anymore, but if I'm<br/>wrong, then that's all the more reason to put it out of<br/>commission—for good.")
('Fie', "We'll stop at nothing to take you down.")
('Rixia', "If they really are connected, then it's my duty to put<br/>an end to it. Once and for all.")
('Shizuna', "Haha. You're waaay out of my league. Why don't you<br/>down a few more bottles and get back to<br/>me, mm'kay?")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Hahaha! You kiddin' me? That shit's for the weak.")
('Viola', "Now, then! It's time for the fireworks show! I can't<br/>WAIT to see Oración burst into flames!")
('Viola', 'But first, I will drown you in a sea of fear. Take your<br/>final breath, because the tide of death draws near!')
('Van', "It's over. Time to surrender.")
('Viola', "No way in hell I'd do that!")
('Van', '(Shit! If I dodge this...)')
('Van', '(Sorry.)')
('Viola', 'Gah...')
('Viola', "Ah... It's funny how life works...")
('Viola', "At long last, I'm bidding farewell to this<br/>wretched world...")
('Viola', 'So why...? Why do I feel so...sad?')
('Viola', 'Oh, boss...if only I could be by your side one last—')
('Judith', '...')
('Feri', '...')
('Aaron', '...')
('Quatre', '...')
('Agnès', 'Van...')
('Risette', '...')
('Van', "Don't worry about me. This isn't like what happened<br/>with Aida, and it's not like it's my first time, either.")
('Van', "In a spriggan's line of work, sometimes the situation<br/>calls for it—and I'll be damned if I let anyone else<br/>here take on that burden.")
('Agnès', "No. I promised I'd shoulder it with<br/>everyone, remember?")
('Agnès', "And you're no exception, Van.")
('Agnès', "I won't let you bear this alone.")
('Van', '...')
('Quatre', "I won't, either. It's too heavy a load for one person.")
('Bergard', '...')
('Cao', "(The sentimental air in this room is quite thick.<br/>It's rather concerning, given who they're up against.)")
('Rixia', "(I wouldn't worry. That's just part of who they are.)")
('Kurogane', '(Their reactions are rather...concerning. Will they be<br/>able to handle the battles ahead, I wonder?)')
('Shizuna', "(Eh, they'll be fine. After all, they've got heartless<br/>monsters like us watching over them.)")
('Walter the Direwolf', "(Hah. I'm surrounded by a bunch of wusses.)")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', '(Heehee. I do not think we are in a position to judge<br/>them on the matters of the heart. After all, it is we<br/>who are broken.)')
('Van', '(Sorry.)')
('Viola', 'Guh!')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Whew. Close call.')
('Elaine', "If you thought I'd let you kill someone under my<br/>watch, then you're an idiot.")
('Fie', "We won't let you have an unnecessary death on<br/>your conscience.")
('Van', 'You guys...')
('Van', 'Thanks. Guess I owe you one.')
('Agnès', 'A-Are you okay?!')
('Viola', 'Ugh!')
('Viola', "How DARE you show me pity! I told you I don't<br/>want it—so hurry up and kill me!")
('Van', 'Agh!')
('Viola', 'Wha...?!')
('Elaine', 'Van!')
('Agnès', 'V-Van! Are you okay?!')
('Van', "...Yeah. She missed my vitals. It'll heal soon enough.")
('Aaron', "Oh, drop the tough-guy act, already! Why're you<br/>always treating your own body like it isn't worth shit?!")
('Feri', "We'll heal you right away!")
('Risette', "I'm on it!")
('Elaine', "I'll help, too!")
('Viola', '...Why?')
('Viola', "Why didn't you kill me? You could've struck me<br/>down easily from that distance!")
('Viola', 'So do it! Finish me off! I lost, so hurry up and kill me!')
('Van', "Sorry, but I'm turnin' down that request. It just ain't<br/>up to my standards.")
('Van', "You got a lot of crimes to answer for, missy.<br/>Your group cooked up a real shitty plot, and y'all got<br/>a lot of innocent folks mixed up in it, too.")
('Van', "So I can't let you take the easy way out. Not my style.")
('Viola', 'Ugh!')
('Van', "I ain't got a shred of sympathy for you...")
('Van', '...but I do get that you had no one else to turn to<br/>back then.')
('Van', "And that's what we're here for—to help people who<br/>have no one else in their corner.")
('Viola', '...Huh?')
('Van', "I'd wager you're gonna be facin' the death penalty.")
('Van', "Though if you dodge that bullet and get outta the<br/>slammer, don't go to a piece of shit like Dantès if<br/>you're in trouble. Send out a 4SPG instead.")
('Van', "Can't guarantee we'll take it on—depends on the pay<br/>and whether it interests me. But I'll hear you out.")
('Viola', '...')
('Agnès', 'Van...')
('Viola', 'Haha... Ahahaha!')
('Viola', 'Hah... Wow. I just got beat by a crazy bastard with an<br/>even crazier profession. Pathetic.')
('Viola', 'Where did my life go so wrong...?')
('Aaron', "Well, that wasn't exactly the sweet and satisfying<br/>revenge I've been craving, but eh. It'll do.")
('Feri', "Yeah. It could've ended a lot worse.")
('Van', 'The upper zone boss Viola has been defeated.<br/>Zone clear. Round one complete.')
('Feri', 'Ah!')
('Quatre', 'The activation device!')
('Melchior', 'Ahaha! Well done, well done! I believe some<br/>congratulations are in order!')
('Melchior', "Oho! Well, I certainly didn't see that end coming.")
('Melchior', 'The first boss of our little game was defeated by none<br/>other than...Team Arkride Solutions!')
('Melchior', 'And with over ten minutes to spare, no less!<br/>An impressive feat, to be sure.')
('Melchior', "I had the slightest suspicion you would be the ones to<br/>slay the 'fair maiden.' And what a beautiful massacre<br/>it was!")
('Melchior', '...Is what I would like to say, but you spared her<br/>pathetic life. And now she must live on in shame.')
('Melchior', "Fortunately for her, the boss is busy at the moment.<br/>Had he seen that miserable performance, she<br/>would've surely welcomed death's sweet embrace.")
('Van', '...')
('Judith', 'You really are the lowest of the low!')
('Quatre', 'Save your breath, Judith. Blowing a fuse over that<br/>mental nutcase is a clear waste of energy.')
('Melchior', "Ahaha! Aww, why so angry? You're the undisputed<br/>winners of round one! You should be over the moon!")
('Melchior', 'Perhaps I should present you with a little reward for<br/>this momentous occasion. That ought to get you in a<br/>celebratory mood. ❤')
('Agnès', 'A reward?')
('Melchior', 'Indeed. I shall answer one—and only one—question<br/>of your choosing.')
('Melchior', 'I can only imagine the number of questions that are<br/>swimming around in those little heads of yours.')
('Melchior', 'Tread carefully, though. The other teams are no<br/>doubt listening in on every word.')
('Van', "There's one that's been naggin' me.")
('Van', "Why'd you pick Oración as the venue for this game?")
('Melchior', "Huh? That's all? What an utterly<br/>rudimentary question.")
('Melchior', "This underground labyrinth is one reason.<br/>It's the quintessential playground for our<br/>game—the happiest of happy hunting grounds!")
('Melchior', "It's also the home of some people we owe very<br/>much to. You may ask, 'But who could they be...?'<br/>Too bad I'm only answering one question!")
('Elaine', '(...)')
('Van', '...')
('Van', '...')
('Melchior', 'Anyway, round two will begin tomorrow at 10AM.<br/>The remaining players will be invited once more.')
('Melchior', 'Use your free time wisely, now. Preparedness is<br/>paramount to winning this game.')
('Melchior', 'And with that, I bid you adieu! ♪')
('System', 'The first day of the game came to a close.')
('System', "But before Van's group could bid farewell to their<br/>collaborators and exit the labyrinth...")
('System', '...they had to decide what to do about Viola.')
('Van', "(She might be unconscious right now, but she's still<br/>an Almata exec. Someone needs to keep a watchful<br/>eye on her till this is over.)")
('Van', "(And that someone can't be us. Can't afford to split<br/>my team. I should hand her over to a group with<br/>more manpower...but who?)")
('Van', '...Mind if we leave her with you guys?')
('Fie', "Sure thing. We'll take her into our custody.")
('Zin the Immovable', "We're a little short-staffed at the moment, but I'm<br/>sure we can lean on the CID a little.")
('Van', 'Cool.')
('Elaine', '...Yes, of course.')
('Van', "I think handin' her over to the guild is our best bet,<br/>even if they're short-staffed.")
('Van', "I'll give Elaine a call.")
('Agnès', "Don't forget that Renne's there, too. She can help out<br/>if need be.")
('Cao', 'What a shame. And here I was, ready to pounce at<br/>the opportunity to interrogate her. Might<br/>you reconsider?')
('Van', "Yeah, no. If we left her in your hands, there's no<br/>tellin' what'd happen to her.")
('Rixia', "It's thanks to their efforts that we won at all. I don't<br/>think you have room to object here.")
('Cao', '*sigh* Indeed. Truly a pity.')
('Van', '...Mind if we leave her with you guys?')
('Cao', 'Well, this is a surprise.')
('Van', "Normally I'd have given her over to the guild, but we<br/>know they're a bit short-staffed right now.")
('Van', "Probably would be hard to work with the local cops,<br/>too, so I think this is the best option we've got.")
('Van', "First things first, though. Promise me you'll hand her<br/>over to the capital police when this is all over, or I'll<br/>find someone else.")
('Cao', 'Very well. I will do my best to adhere to that promise.')
('Cao', 'Depending on what we learn from her, however, it<br/>may not be easy to convince the powers that be to<br/>release her from our custody.')
('Aaron', 'Those damn elders...')
('Rixia', 'But I will do everything within my power to ensure<br/>she is brought to the authorities when we are done.<br/>You have my word.')
('Judith', "That's reassuring to hear, at least.")
('Elaine', "...But why? Are you saying that you can't trust us<br/>with her?")
('Van', "What? No. I'm doing this 'cause I know you guys are<br/>stretched thin.")
('Van', "Probably would be hard to work with the local cops,<br/>too, so I think this is the best option we've got.")
('Elaine', "I mean, you're not exactly wrong, but... Ugh.")
('Fie', '*sigh* The truth hurts.')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Hate to admit it, but we do have a lot on our plate as<br/>it is.')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Could you do us a solid and arrange for them to hand<br/>her over to the capital police when all of this is over?')
('Van', "That's the plan.")
('Van', "I think handin' her over to the guild is our best bet,<br/>even if they're short-staffed.")
('Van', "I'll give Elaine a call.")
('Agnès', "Don't forget that Renne's there, too. She can help out<br/>if need be.")
('Aaron', "You, uh, sure that's a good idea?")
('Van', "I'm not keen on the idea, either, but the guild's<br/>stretched thin right now.")
('Van', "Probably would be hard to work with the local cops,<br/>too, so I think this is the best option we've got.")
('Van', "I'm plannin' to ask them to hand her over to the<br/>capital police when this is all over, though.")
('Agnès', "It's hard to feel at ease when Heiyue is involved...but<br/>there aren't many other viable alternatives.")
('Judith', "At least Ri—I mean, Yin is with them. She'll stop<br/>them from going too far. Of that I'm certain.")
('Shizuna', '*sigh* And after going through all the trouble of<br/>beating her up...')
('Shizuna', "I'd love to take custody of her, but I'll let this one go.<br/>You did risk your life to spare her, so it's only fair.")
('Kurogane', 'We cannot seize custody by force. Doing so would be<br/>violating the shinobi code of honor.')
('Van', "Sweet. Thanks for bein' so chill about it.<br/>(Ah. So their client must be...)")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "So you're sparing the wolf who has bared her teeth at<br/>you and your flock? How foolish.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'Perhaps we ought to save you from yourselves.<br/>I hereby offer to send her to sleep with the fishes.')
('Agnès', '...')
('Van', 'Offer rejected. Keep your filthy paws to yourselves,<br/>both of you.')
('Walter the Direwolf', "Why, though? She's lost the will to go on, so she's as<br/>good as dead, if you ask me.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "You've gone soft, Arkride. Hope that doesn't come<br/>back to bite you one day.")
('Van', 'Yeah, yeah. Whatever.')
('System', 'After turning Viola over to the guild, they returned to<br/>the inn...')
('System', 'After turning Viola over to Heiyue, they returned to<br/>the inn...')
('System', "Bergard arranged for Viola's body to be discreetly<br/>transferred to the cathedral.")
('System', 'After that, they all returned to the inn...')
('System', '...and as soon as their bodies hit the beds, they fell<br/>into a deep sleep.')
(500, 'November 21st, 12:00PM')
('System', 'Keycard confirmed.')
('System', 'Team Arkride Solutions can now enter the<br/>middle zone.')
('Judith', 'Great! On to the next zone we go.')
('Judith', "Wait, how will the other teams get in? We're the only<br/>ones who can go through this door, right?")
('Risette', 'Correct, but I very much doubt this is the<br/>only entrance.')
('Agnès', 'Yeah. There has to be more than one way in.')
('Quatre', "This wouldn't be much of a game if our competition<br/>couldn't even enter the playing field.")
('Bergard', 'I still would like to know why we must compete to<br/>begin with. What are they trying to achieve here...?')
('Aaron', 'You can ask them that yourself—after we beat<br/>their asses.')
('Feri', "Right. Let's save the hard questions for later.")
('Fie', "Guess Elaine really is a no-show. I'm surprised.")
('Zin the Immovable', "Me, too. I was holding out hope that she'd make it.")
('Van', "Well, like I said, we've got more than enough people<br/>for this. We'll just have to give our 110% to make up<br/>the difference.")
('Rixia', 'The battles will only get more difficult from here.<br/>We will have to give this our all if we want to win.')
('Cao', 'Indeed. We will have to rely on the ladies and<br/>gentlemen of Arkride Solutions to carry the day.')
('Van', "We'll carry our weight for sure, so you do the same.")
('Shizuna', "The people we fought yesterday were so boring—<br/>beating them was kids' stuff. Hopefully our new<br/>opponents will be more up my alley.")
('Kurogane', 'Please do not lose sight of our objective, Princess.<br/>We are here to fulfill our contract. Nothing more.')
('Van', "Aww, c'mon. Let the girl live a little.")
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Okay, then. Ready to have some fun out there?')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "Quite. Perhaps we should take a page out of Renne's<br/>book and have a little tea party along the way.")
('Van', "(The way they're talkin', you'd think they were on a<br/>picnic or something.)")
('Van', "All right, gang. Let's roll.")
('Melchior', 'Heehee. This is all going according to plan.')
('Melchior', "At this rate, though, the team that'll reach Alexandre<br/>is sure to be—")
('Melchior', 'Ahaha! So this was your endgame. I was curious as to<br/>why you were wandering around by your lonesome.')
('Melchior', "Turns out, you just wanted a little private time<br/>with me. Or perhaps you're here to fight?<br/>How daring.")
('Elaine', 'Wrong on both counts.')
('Elaine', "I'm not so foolish as to attack you outside of the<br/>game's framework. That's not a risk I'm willing<br/>to take.")
('Elaine', "I'm certain you rigged the nuclear device to explode<br/>should anyone lay a hand on you. You've probably<br/>done the same to one of the other bombs as well.")
('Melchior', 'Ngh. You do realize that nobody likes a Miss<br/>Know-It-All, yes?')
('Elaine', "I'm not here to strike you down—but I am here to<br/>strike a deal.")
('Elaine', "I want information, and you're going to tell me<br/>everything I want to know.")
('Elaine', "In return, I'll add a little dash of excitement to<br/>your game. How about it?")
('Melchior', 'Oho. How interesting.')
('System', 'A fearsome foe is prowling around.')
('System', 'Found <br/>.')
('System', 'Found <br/>.')
('System', 'Quest Upper Zone Extermination completed!')
('System', 'Received')
('System', 'The door is tightly locked.')
('System', 'The door is tightly locked.')
('Van', "The second round doesn't start until noon.<br/>Gotta make sure we're ready for it.")
