('Agnès', 'This is surprisingly well lit for an<br/>underground waterway.')
('Van', "Yeah. You can see light pourin' in from the<br/>surface, even.")
('Feri', "There doesn't seem to be much water<br/>flowing, though.")
('Aaron', "And whatever's responsible is waiting for us up ahead.")
('Van', "Just be careful. No such thing as bein' too cautious<br/>when our warning alarm lights up.")
('Agnès', 'Agreed.')
('Feri', '...!')
('Aaron', 'Whoa...')
('Agnès', "A giant plant monster? It's huge...")
('Feri', 'Th-That explains where all the water went!')
('Van', "Must've grown nice and strong soakin' up sunlight<br/>and drinkin' straight from the oasis tap.")
('Van', 'Look what else is down here, too.')
('Agnès', "A Genesis! How in Aidios' name did it get there?")
('Feri', 'Watch out, everyone!')
('Aaron', 'Overgrown bastard...!')
('Van', "Time to take it down! C'mon!")
('Aaron', 'Ha! Burn in hell, asshole!')
('Agnès', '*pant* Is everyone all right?')
('Feri', 'Yeah. That was hard, but we did it...')
('Van', '...?!')
('Feri', "What's that?")
('Agnès', 'An...angel...?')
('Van', 'Get down!')
('Agnès', 'Oh, no!')
('Aaron', 'Son of a—!')
('Feri', 'You evil malaak... That belongs to Agnès!')
('Feri', '...?!')
('Aaron', 'How the hell did it block them all?!')
('Agnès', '...!')
('Van', 'Raaaaaah!')
('Van', 'Ugh!')
('Agnès', 'Van!')
('Feri', 'That was too dangerous!')
('Aaron', "Why're you taking all the damn blows yourself?!")
('Mare', "It's my time to shine again!")
('Aaron', "Ah! It's you!")
('Agnès', 'Mare!')
('Van', "There you are! I can take it, so let's just do this!")
('Mare', "What're you in such a rush for?")
('Mare', "Oh, well. The Grendel's all—")
('Van', 'There is no need to bear any nightmare—<br/>\u3000for you are already one made flesh.')
('Van', 'RAAAAAAAAAAH!')
('Mare', '...Huh?')
('Agnès', "What's happening?")
('Van/Grendel', 'URGH! AAAAAARGH!')
('Aaron', "The hell's goin' on?!")
('Feri', "H-He looks like he's in real pain!")
('Agnès', "Stop the process! O-Or he's going to...")
('Mare', "I'm not doing any of this! Wait! Could it be...?")
('Aaron', "I don't think so!")
('Feri', "You're not going near him!")
('Van/Grendel', 'Urgh... Aaargh...')
('Agnès', 'Van! Pull yourself together!')
('Agnès', "We're right here with you! Please, try and stay calm!")
('Van/Grendel', 'Urgh... Agnè...')
('Van/Grendel', '...?!')
('Feri', 'Huh...?! / Damn!')
('Aaron', 'Wha...?')
('Feri', 'What just...happened...?')
('Van/Grendel', '...!')
('Agnès', "Y-You're...!")
('Risette', "I don't know who you are, but this man has entered<br/>into a contract with us.")
('Risette', 'If you intend to harm him, I will be forced to respond<br/>in accordance with company policy.')
('Olympia', '...I see. So you are affiliated with them, are you?')
('Olympia', 'We have recovered our target. There is no need to<br/>continue this battle any longer.')
('Olympia', 'Farewell, then. With me, Ishtanti.')
('Feri', 'Just what is that thing...?')
('Aaron', 'An angelic puppet?')
('Feri', 'No! They still have the Genesis!')
('Van', "...We couldn't have got it back off of them if we tried.")
('Agnès', "It's a small miracle we all came out of that unharmed<br/>as it is.")
('Feri', 'Van...')
('Aaron', 'Heh. Back to normal, huh?')
('Agnès', 'Are you all right, Van? What about when you were<br/>hurt earlier?')
('Van', "Ah, that's just a scratch. I'm more worried about how<br/>damn tired I feel.")
('Van', "Looks like Mare-Bear just took off without sayin'<br/>anything, too. Figures.")
('Van', "Is everything you people make a frickin' mystery?")
('Van', "Sure wasn't expectin' you to drop in as emergency<br/>backup, either.")
('Risette', 'Supporting our clients is my primary duty—and one I<br/>take great pride in.')
('Risette', 'My fortuitous timing also helped me to contextualize<br/>the peculiarities in your previous review.')
('Van', '...Bah. I really screwed up on this one.')
('Agnès', '...')
('Van', "Heh. Can't say this is how I thought our first meeting<br/>in person would go.")
('Risette', 'I find these circumstances rather surprising myself.')
('Aaron', "What the hell...? She shows up outta nowhere, and<br/>you're acting like you've known each other for years?")
('Feri', "I remember seeing your face on Van's Xipha!<br/>Who are you?")
('Agnès', 'And, if I may ask, what company are you<br/>affiliated with?')
('Van', "Sorry. Guess I never explained this part... I'm fine<br/>now, thanks.")
('Risette', 'My apologies for my belated introduction.')
('Risette', 'My name is Risette Twinings, and I work as<br/>a concierge.')
('Risette', 'My employer is Marduk Total Security Company, a<br/>private military company.')
('Risette', 'Mr. Arkride here is a valued external tester for our<br/>company, and someone to whom we owe a great deal.')
('Risette', 'It is a pleasure to meet you all.')
('Risette', 'I see I made it in time.')
('Archaeologist Inigo', 'Oh! It feels unreal to finally be setting foot<br/>down here.')
('Feri', 'We actually came by ourselves on a different<br/>job yesterday!')
('Feri', 'You might be surprised at just how wide and open<br/>it is. It feels real unique, too.')
('Archaeologist Inigo', "That's no surprise. Ancient Tharbad had a very<br/>distinctive culture.")
('Archaeologist Inigo', "I'm not very fond of the musty smell in the<br/>air, though. This certainly isn't a very comfortable<br/>place to linger.")
('Aaron', "We're here to keep you alive, not comfortable.<br/>Besides, it's a waterway, what were you expecting?")
('Archaeologist Inigo', "Haha. Don't worry, I know. Let's just take care of<br/>business and get out of here as soon as possible.")
('Agnès', '...?')
('Van', "So, where exactly are we takin' you?")
('Archaeologist Inigo', "I'm here to find a specific mural.")
('Archaeologist Inigo', "It's closely connected to the history of the Septian<br/>Church and should be somewhere in the eastern part<br/>of these passages.")
('Agnès', "Understood. We'll try and head in that<br/>direction, then.")
('Risette', 'We will see that you arrive safely at your destination.')
('Risette', 'I shall stay close behind you to ensure that no<br/>monsters attack from the rear.')
('Feri', "I'll stand guard on the flank, then!")
('Archaeologist Inigo', "There's no need to overdo the protection,<br/>young ladies.")
('Archaeologist Inigo', "I do want to have a little freedom to walk around and<br/>take in the sights. I just don't want to end up<br/>surrounded by a horde of monsters.")
('Van', "Have it your way. We'll just follow along and keep an<br/>eye out on all sides, then.")
('Risette', "I will respect our client's wishes.")
('Feri', 'Try not to get separated from us, though.')
('Van', "All right, that settles that. Let's head on eastward.")
('Archaeologist Inigo', "Thanks! I'm counting on you guys.")
('Agnès', "(Umm... Van? I'm not so sure about Inigo...)")
('Agnès', '(I realize this is rude to say about a client, but<br/>something seems...off about him.)')
('Van', "(It ain't just you.)")
('Van', "(I'll keep an eye on him for now. You make sure to do<br/>the same.)")
('Agnès', '(Understood.)')
('Aaron', '(Hmph.)')
('Feri', "(...Hmm? What's up with everyone? Why does it feel<br/>like I'm the only one out of the loop?)")
('System', 'Quest Archaeological Expedition started!')
('Agnès', "Hmm... We've come a fair way now, but there's still<br/>no sign of the mural we're looking for.")
('Feri', "Yeah, you're right. You'd think we would've seen it<br/>by now.")
('Archaeologist Inigo', "Quite so. I'd be lost if I were on my own—these<br/>corridors all look the same.")
('Van', "Looks like something's found its way to us, though.")
('Risette', 'Please stay back, sir.')
('Aaron', 'This just got a bit more fun.')
('Van', "Let's take 'em down, guys!")
('Risette', 'That was the last of them.')
('Van', 'Yeah. Good job, everyone.')
('Archaeologist Inigo', '(Hmm... I know I wanted someone strong to escort<br/>me here, but these people might fit the bill a little<br/>too well.)')
('Archaeologist Inigo', '(Still, even they will be no match for—)')
('Feri', 'Is something wrong?')
('Archaeologist Inigo', "Oh, did I space out? I'm sorry, I was just amazed by<br/>how capable you all are!")
('Archaeologist Inigo', "There were so many of those monsters, and yet you<br/>made defeating them look almost trivial! Not to<br/>mention, I'm completely unharmed.")
('Archaeologist Inigo', 'I can see I did well by hiring you.')
('Agnès', 'Thank you for saying so, sir.')
('Aaron', "It looked trivial 'cause it was. I was hoping for them<br/>to put up a bit more of a fight than that.")
('Van', "That's the spirit. Now let's get back on track.")
('Feri', '(That feels like...)')
('Feri', '...')
('Van', "Here we go. Took a bit longer than I was hopin', but<br/>this is the eastmost part of the waterways.")
('Feri', "It looks the same as everywhere else we've<br/>passed, though...")
('Aaron', "Yeah. Where's this mural we came to find?")
('Archaeologist Inigo', "I'm wondering the same thing. The texts clearly<br/>indicate that it's meant to be here.")
('Archaeologist Inigo', 'The water flowing through that grate leads beneath<br/>the temple, you see.')
('Archaeologist Inigo', 'That sacred area has been a key location since<br/>antiquity, and so there should absolutely be a mural<br/>here somewhere.')
('Archaeologist Inigo', 'Since we came all this way, could I trouble you to<br/>help me find it?')
('Van', "Sure—is what I'd say if you were any other client.")
('Van', "But you're just trying to distract us so you can call<br/>your goons to finish us off, aren't you?")
('Archaeologist Inigo', 'Wh-What?')
('Feri', 'I sense four people lying in wait.')
('Feri', 'I sense three people lying in wait.')
('Feri', 'I sense two people lying in wait.')
('Aaron', "If you thought we were getting strung along for real,<br/>you've got another thing coming.")
('Archaeologist Inigo', "How rude. I have no idea what spurred this on, but I<br/>don't appreciate being treated like a criminal.")
('Archaeologist Inigo', 'Have I offended you in some way?')
('Van', "Nah. I only played along with the bit because I<br/>couldn't pin down what you were really after at first.")
('Van', "But you just gave the game away. You're out to steal<br/>from the area under the temple you just mentioned,<br/>aren't you?")
('Van', "From what I've heard, all manner of artifacts 'n'<br/>offerings get stored in places like that.")
('Van', "You're planning to sneak in there through that grate.")
('Agnès', "You weren't lying about needing us to escort you<br/>this far.")
('Agnès', "But now that we've cleared the path, you don't need<br/>us any longer.")
('Risette', 'We are well aware that your identity as an<br/>archaeologist is fraudulent as well.')
('Risette', 'I would suggest that you put a little more effort into<br/>maintaining your cover in your future attempts.')
('Archaeologist Inigo', 'Haha... Hahaha!')
('Archaeologist Inigo', "I see you're not just stronger than I was hoping for,<br/>but smarter, too. What a shame.")
('Archaeologist Inigo', 'Yet despite seeing through me, you were still foolish<br/>to come all this way with the eldest of the<br/>Devancy Brothers...')
('Archaeologist Inigo', "Heh. Guess it's possible to be clever and stupid at the<br/>same time.")
('Archaeologist Inigo', 'Come on out, guys!')
(40301, "So you're the spriggan, huh?")
(40301, 'You look pretty tough, but this was over the second<br/>you took the job!')
(40303, "We're not gonna go easy on you, even if you got<br/>women and kids with you.")
('Officer Camilo', "I haven't forgotten about what you did to me<br/>yesterday, and you're gonna pay for it!")
('Officer Camilo', "I haven't forgotten about what you did to<br/>me yesterday.")
('Officer Camilo', 'Luckily my brother managed to forge release papers<br/>for me and pull some strings.')
('Officer Camilo', "So I'm out on good behavior! Can't guarantee I'll<br/>behave, though.")
('Van', "Psh. Talk about not knowin' when to quit.")
(40302, "I've got a score to settle with you, too.")
(40302, 'My brother bailed me out after the guild handed me<br/>over to the police, so here I am.')
(40302, "Too bad you won't be interfering with the Devancy<br/>Brothers ever again. We'll see to that!")
(40302, "I'm not gonna forget what you did to me last night.")
(40302, 'I was thrown in a cell after the guild handed me over<br/>to the police...')
(40302, 'Luckily my brother managed to forge release papers<br/>for me and pull some strings.')
(40302, "So I'm out on good behavior! Can't guarantee I'll<br/>behave, though.")
('Van', "Psh. Talk about not knowin' when to quit.")
(40302, "Too bad for you that you won't be interfering with<br/>the Devancy Brothers ever again. We'll see to that!")
('Aaron', "So there's three of you guys, huh? I figured it was just<br/>two—not that I give a shit either way.")
('Van', 'This was your endgame, then? Run around town in<br/>disguise so you could eventually do this?')
('Archaeologist Inigo', "That's right. My brothers pretended to be a cop and a<br/>bracer to see just how well things in the city<br/>were guarded.")
('Archaeologist Inigo', 'The film festival here in Tharbad suddenly found<br/>itself in the limelight after the one in Messeldam<br/>was canceled...')
('Archaeologist Inigo', "There was no way they'd be able to send enough idiot<br/>cops to handle it on such short notice—and we're<br/>here to exploit that!")
('Agnès', 'I knew it. So this is what you came all the way from<br/>Edith for.')
('Van', "That's a whole lotta energy to burn for smalltime crap<br/>like this.")
('Van', 'Well, whatever. Your game of dressup is about to<br/>come to an end.')
('Van', "The Devancy Brothers? I feel like I've heard that<br/>name somewhere before...")
('Van', 'Well, whatever. Your game of dressup is about to<br/>come to an end.')
('Archaeologist Inigo', "Hmph. We were planning to take care of you<br/>ourselves, but I know from watching you that we're<br/>not up for the task.")
('Archaeologist Inigo', "But don't worry, we have a backup plan!")
('Feri', 'A bomb?!')
('Aaron', 'Not a chance!')
('Archaeologist Inigo', 'Wha—?!')
('Officer Camilo', '*cough* *cough*')
(40302, 'You sneaky little...!')
(40301, 'How the hell did you repel them both?!')
(40303, 'What are we gonna do now?!')
('Van', "Looks like those weren't bombs after all.")
('Risette', 'They were smoke grenades full of scents that<br/>attract monsters!')
('Feri', 'There sure are a lot of them...')
('Aaron', "How's that for some just deserts?")
('Archaeologist Inigo', "Bah! We're still making for the temple—we've just<br/>gotta lose these things first!")
('Van', "Hmm... Well, ain't this a mess.")
('Van', "(We're all strong enough to take these monsters out<br/>in record time if we want to.)")
('Van', "(Then we can take all the thieves into custody, too.<br/>I think that's the most respectable way to<br/>handle this.)")
('Van', "(But we could also just let 'em wear each other down<br/>for a while first...)")
('Van', "Take the monsters out first! Then we'll apprehend<br/>these idiots!")
('Agnès', 'Understood!')
('Risette', 'You have my full support!')
('Archaeologist Inigo', "If they want to fight the monsters, let 'em!<br/>We're getting to the temple!")
('Aaron', "Ha. That's convenient. For us, anyway.")
('Feri', "We've got to take care of these things as quickly as we<br/>can so we can go after them!")
('Van', "Y'know what? We're gonna capitalize on their<br/>dumb mistake.")
('Van', "Let's wait for the monsters to wear them out.<br/>Then we'll strike!")
('Aaron', 'Works for me. Efficiency first, baby.')
('Agnès', "Are you sure that's okay? It feels like we're doing<br/>something a bit...immoral.")
('Archaeologist Inigo', "Grr! So that's your play, is it?!")
(40301, 'What did we do to deserve this?!')
('Officer Camilo', "Damn it. We've got no choice but to fight!")
(40302, "Fine, but they're gonna PAY for this after we're done!")
(40303, "You'll regret this, spriggan!")
('Risette', 'The monsters are gradually gaining more of an upper<br/>hand over the criminals.')
('Van', "Yeah. I'm not gonna let any of 'em die, so we should<br/>probably jump in now.")
('Archaeologist Inigo', "*pant* We're so close to our goal! So close!")
(40301, 'Wh-What are we gonna do?!')
(40303, "They've got us cornered!")
('Officer Camilo', "I can't believe those guys ruined our whole plan!")
(40302, "There's no way in hell that I'm gonna die here!<br/>No way!")
('Aaron', "Where'd all that spunk you had earlier go, punks?")
('Archaeologist Inigo', "Why'd you interfere? What's your game now?!")
('Van', "We're not evil, y'know. We're not actually gonna sit<br/>back and watch you get killed.")
('Van', "Besides, I've got another use in mind for you guys.")
('Archaeologist Inigo', "Tsk. You just try! We've still got some fight left in<br/>us yet!")
('Feri', "We'll do more than try!")
('Archaeologist Inigo', "Tsk. I can't believe they managed to take out that<br/>many all at once...")
('Archaeologist Inigo', "But now that the monsters are out of our way, it's<br/>time to go claim our spoils!")
('Archaeologist Inigo', '...!')
('Risette', 'I am afraid you will not be going anywhere.')
('Van', "Sorry for the wait. Now it's your turn.")
(40301, 'N-No way...')
('Officer Camilo', "Hmph. You guys think you're so damn tough!")
(40302, "Have it your way! You're gonna see what we're really<br/>made of!")
('Archaeologist Inigo', "Fighting those monsters must've worn them down.<br/>This should be easy!")
(40303, "Yeah! Let's do this!")
('Archaeologist Inigo', "Curses... Our scheme wasn't supposed to go<br/>like this...")
('Archaeologist Inigo', 'How can they be so strong when half of them are<br/>just kids?')
('Feri', "Heehee! That's what you get for judging<br/>by appearances!")
('Van', "Heh. You'd think they'd know better, having so much<br/>experience bein' other people.")
('Van', "Heh. You'd think they'd know better, especially our<br/>star actor over here.")
('Aaron', "So, what do we do now that we've caught them?")
('Van', 'The Devancy Brothers are wanted criminals in<br/>the capital.')
('Van', "But since one of 'em was our client for this job, we<br/>basically wound up doing all this for free.")
('Van', "That's why I'm thinkin' we should hand 'em over to<br/>the police and collect the bounty. That way, at least<br/>we'll get our due.")
('Van', "I feel like I've heard the name 'Devancy Brothers'<br/>somewhere before. What about you guys?")
('Risette', "I took the liberty of looking them up in<br/>Marduk's database.")
('Risette', 'They appear to be a group of wanted criminals that<br/>operate out of Edith.')
('Agnès', 'So they came all the way from the capital to<br/>cause trouble?')
('Aaron', "I'm guessing their plan was to take advantage of the<br/>distractions around the film festival to line<br/>their pockets.")
('Van', "That settles it, then. We're handin' them over to<br/>the cops.")
('Van', "Since one of 'em was our client for this job, we<br/>basically wound up doing all this for free.")
('Van', "But if we hand 'em in to the boys with badges, we'll<br/>be able to collect a bounty. So at least then we're<br/>gettin' paid.")
('Van', "Bounty hunting's another part of being a spriggan,<br/>after all.")
('Aaron', "Fine by me. I'm not too big on busting my ass for<br/>nothing in return.")
('Agnès', "Ahaha... What you're saying is entirely logical and<br/>legal, and yet somehow I feel guilty about it all<br/>the same...")
('Risette', 'So this, too, is a facet of the spriggan way? How<br/>very educational.')
('Risette', 'In any case, I will contact the local police department<br/>right away.')
('Risette', 'I remember the route we took here well, so I should<br/>be able to guide them down here in short order.')
('Van', 'Thanks.')
('System', 'Risette contacted the authorities, and before long,<br/>armed officers arrived to take the men into custody.')
('System', 'After learning that they had apprehended none other<br/>than the infamous Devancy Brothers, the police were<br/>extremely grateful...')
('System', 'And after they all returned to the entrance, Van and<br/>the others were given the bounty they wanted.')
('System', 'Quest Archaeological Expedition completed!')
('System', 'Received')
