('Agnès', 'Oh!')
('Van', 'Oh, no...')
('Feri', 'It stopped...')
('Quatre', "It didn't shine half as much as it does when a Genesis<br/>is involved.")
('Risette', 'Could it be an omen? Or it is reacting to a vestige<br/>of something?')
('Bergard', 'Hmm... That light served as a valuable guide to us in<br/>Oración as well.')
('Judith', '(It sounded like that temporary flicker was what I<br/>triggered when we first met, too.)')
('Aaron', "Heh. Sure seems like there's something here.")
('Van', 'Yeah. Agnès, make sure the backup crew is<br/>on standby.')
('Van', "We might need them in here at a moment's notice.")
('Agnès', 'Right!')
('Feri', '...!')
('Agnès', 'There they are...')
('Van', '...')
(61611, "I-It's all over... We're finished...")
(61612, "This can't be happening... What did we do to<br/>deserve this?")
('Aaron', "The hell's gotten into you guys?")
(61612, 'Eeek!')
(61613, "Who're you?! Y-You here for a fight?!")
('Aaron', 'Tch...')
('Van', "I'm a spriggan from here in Edith.")
('Van', "Part of my crew's job is helpin' people who can't turn<br/>to the guild or the cops for aid.")
('Agnès', "So, umm...if there's something you need help with,<br/>we might be able to give it to you.")

('Feri', 'Umm...')
('Judith', "*sigh* Maybe they're doing better than we thought.")

('Feri', 'Their fear really runs that deep.')
('Van', "Melchior's on the run, and we took out<br/>Arioch personally!")
('Van', 'The same goes for their boss, Dantès!')

(40352, 'Oof...')
('Feri', "They're fine! They're just unconscious.")

('Quatre', '*sigh* What a relief. But what just happened?')
('Agnès', "Th-That's a relief, but...what just happened?")
('Van', "Gimme a break... Timed your entrance perfectly,<br/>now, didn't you?")
('Kincaid', 'Certainly not—I only just arrived.')
('Aaron', "It's that damn desk jockey again.")
('Feri', 'His aim was so precise...')
('Agnès', 'Umm... Thank you very much for your help.')
('Kincaid', 'Think nothing of it. Or would you prefer to call it a<br/>debt owed?')
('Van', "Hmph. This should be either a guild problem or<br/>somethin' your side should've handled from the start.")
('Van', 'Your boss mentioned how these guys had slipped<br/>through the cracks of your cleanup operation.<br/>Feels like you did a sloppy job to me.')
('Kincaid', 'Not at all. This was the most efficient approach to<br/>the problem.')
('Kincaid', 'We performed a thorough cleaning of the major cities<br/>outside of Edith and drove all of the leftovers here.')
('Kincaid', "We do have a Hercules unit standing by that we<br/>could send in at a moment's notice...")

('Kincaid', 'Heh. That was the intention—though whether you<br/>were able to follow the clues was down to you.')
('Kincaid', 'The rules forbade me from getting directly involved<br/>in what happened in Oración.')
('Kincaid', 'So I was forced to stand on the sidelines as the place<br/>filled with fond memories for us was saved by you.<br/>Consider this revenge for that.')
('Van', "Hah. I call bullshit—you ain't the sentimental type.")
('Van', "Still, she's gonna be back in town tomorrow.")
('Van', "And I know she'd give me an earful if I left any<br/>problems unsolved, so I guess I can help you just<br/>this once.")
('Kincaid', 'Heh.')
('Feri', 'Umm...')
('Quatre', "I-It's like I'm seeing two of the same person.")
('Judith', 'You can really tell they go way back.')
('Aaron', 'Ugh. Get a damn room, you wrinkly old farts.')
('Agnès', "Ahaha... We'll help, too, of course!")
('Bergard', 'Hmm... How many more of these troublemakers can<br/>we expect in here?')
('Kincaid', 'We believe there to be roughly thirty. Twenty thugs<br/>and ten former Almata members.')
('Agnès', 'Do you have any idea how many more of them we<br/>can expect in here?')

('Kincaid', 'Oh, I assure you that these teams were decided purely<br/>on combat balance.')
('Kincaid', "You can count on me to support you in battle—and<br/>I'll even throw in some old stories about Van as<br/>a bonus.")
('Agnès', '...What?')
('Feri', 'R-Really?!')
('Aaron', "Heh. NOW I'm in.")
('Van', 'HEY!')
('Quatre', "Maybe being in the other group wouldn't be so bad<br/>after all.")
('Judith', "I wanna know his weaknesses, too. You'll have to<br/>spill later!")
('Feri', 'Can do!')
('Van', "Can DON'T!")
('Agnès', "Ahaha... I won't ask for anything that might count as<br/>a weakness, don't worry.")

('Bergard', 'As we agreed, XEROS and I will remain here.')
('Bergard', 'Contact me when you apprehend any of our suspects.<br/>I will see that they get to the CID.')
('Van', 'Thanks. I know we can always count on you.')
('Kincaid', 'I appreciate your assistance, Mr. Zeman.')
('Feri', "We'll need your help, too, XEROS!")
('XEROS', 'RUFF!')
('Van', "Then let's get this thing started.")
('Van', 'We gotta make for the other side where the two<br/>routes meet, and take in everyone we find along<br/>the way!')
('Quatre', 'Right!')
('Risette', 'Understood.')
('Judith', "We've got this!")
('Kincaid', "Heh. This is the perfect chance to show off all you've<br/>learned under Van.")
('Kincaid', "Let's get to work, Team B! Prove you're better at this<br/>than he is!")
('Feri', 'Got it!')
('Aaron', 'Damn right, I am.')
('Van', "This isn't a competition!")
('Agnès', 'W-Well, take care, everyone!')
('Quatre', 'The same to you, Agnès!')

('Judith', "I'm just glad we all made it here unharmed.")
('Agnès', 'So am I.')
('Kincaid', "I trust you didn't let any of our targets slip past you?")
('Van', 'Heh. The same question right back at you. Still...')
('Risette', 'All of them appear to be behaving just as strangely as<br/>the ones from before.')

('Bergard', "This isn't the first time in recent years that such<br/>beings have emerged.")
('Elaine', 'Indeed. The last time was during the war, I believe?')
('Van', "Yeah. Pretty sure some showed up 'cause of the<br/>Great Twilight.")
('Kincaid', 'That they did. Several even appeared in the Republic.')
('Quatre', 'B-But how did something so significant end up<br/>down here?')
('Aaron', 'You really think these guys feeling cornered was<br/>the cause?')
('Bergard', "...It's hard to say for sure.")

('Agnès', '...')

('Zin the Immovable', 'We could hear the fighting while we were on our<br/>way here.')

('Zin the Immovable', 'Like what?')
('Fie', "You're just imagining it.")
(40451, 'Reporting in, sir!')
(40452, 'Are those the rest of their members?')
('Kincaid', 'Correct. Take them into custody. This should be the<br/>last of them.')
(40451, 'Yes, sir!')
('Van', '*sigh* Feels to me like we were never needed here.')
('Agnès', "Oh, I'm sure that's not true.")

('Feri', 'Same here. As soon as I realized it was over, my<br/>stomach started rumbling like crazy.')
('Fie', "I know it won't make up for everything you've done,<br/>especially in Oración, so we can leave that for some<br/>other time...")
('Fie', '...but how about we all head to the bistro below your<br/>work for a little celebration?')
('Van', '...Huh?')
('Zin the Immovable', "That sounds like a plan to me! I've had my eye on<br/>that place for a while.")
('Zin the Immovable', "Heard even the former president's a fan.")
('Elaine', 'Hold on, you two...')

('Dominion Celis', "The place where you're staying, Master? Hmm...<br/>I'm curious, too.")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "Won't we be troubling them by charging in<br/>unannounced in such large numbers? It's not an inn.")
('Bergard', 'Hmm... It would be best if we asked them first, but<br/>the owner is a generous man. He may well<br/>accommodate us.')
('Van', "Wait! Even you're on board with this?!")
('Agnès', "It's not often we have the chance to go somewhere<br/>together, you know.")
('Agnès', "I think it'd be nice to invite Bermotti, too...and<br/>maybe some of my classmates, if that's all right.")
('Feri', 'Oh! Can we invite Saara and Shaheena, too, then?<br/>And Inspector Daswani!')
('Judith', "Works for me. Maybe I'll give Nina and Gotti a call<br/>so they can join in on the fun.")
('Quatre', "Then I'll give Essy and Supervisor Giscard a call, too.")
('Aaron', "I can see Ashen and the others pitching a fit if they<br/>find out they weren't invited, so I'd better let them in<br/>on this.")
('Risette', "Then I'll reach out to Montmart posthaste.")
('Van', 'Did you HAVE to encourage them? This is gonna be<br/>total chaos...')
('Kincaid', "My only reason is the one I stated—and you're<br/>coming, too, of course.")
('Kincaid', 'Does that work for you, too, Elaine?')
('Elaine', '*sigh* I suppose so.')
('Elaine', 'Heehee. Just thinking about it takes me back to our<br/>school festival afterparty.')
('Van', "There is no way this isn't gonna be way worse...")
