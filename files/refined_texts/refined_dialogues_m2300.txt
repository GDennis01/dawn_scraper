('Aaron', 'There it is.')
('Feri', 'This place is huge!')
('Aaron', 'Back in the day, thousands of miners lived here—')
('Aaron', '...')
('Agnès', 'Is something wrong?')
('Van', "You still hurtin'?")
('Aaron', "No. Don't mind me...")
('Feri', 'Fog!')
('Elaine', 'And it appeared just as quickly as it did last night...')
('Agnès', 'I knew it.')
('Feri', 'And another reaction...')
('Elaine', 'Your purse glowed yesterday as well...')
('Aaron', "So, anyone wanna explain to the class why it's<br/>lighting up like a lantern?")
('Van', "Sorry, but that's confidential. One thing's<br/>certain, though.")
('Van', "Almata's here. No doubt about it.")
('Aaron', "Then it's almost time for a good old-fashioned<br/>ass-kicking!")
('Elaine', "Don't be too hasty. We don't know what awaits us.")
('Van', 'Huh. Another boat.')
('Agnès', 'Do you think it belongs to Almata?')
('Elaine', "It's nearly identical to ours.")
('Aaron', 'Wait a sec...')
('Aaron', "Yeah, this is definitely Shou's other boat.")
('Van', "Don't tell me... Did that freakin' racer wander<br/>in here?")
('Agnès', 'Oh, no...')
('Feri', "Weren't they headed to that island...?")
('Feri', 'We saw them sailing away from the island, but I<br/>thought they were going back to Langport...')
('Aaron', "Then they're either lost or stupid enough to come<br/>on purpose.")
('Aaron', 'Either way, this just got even worse.')
('Elaine', "I don't fully follow, but I gather some civilians found<br/>their way here?")
('Elaine', "And what's more, they're completely unaware of the<br/>danger within?")
('Van', 'Seems like it.')
('Van', "I dunno exactly what's up, but let's keep our eyes out<br/>for 'em.")
('Feri', 'Right!')
('Agnès', "I hope they're all right...")
('System', 'Elaine has temporarily joined the party as a guest.')
('Maxim', 'Come on, guys! Surely we can talk this out!')
('Maxim', "After all, I am Maxim Lugan, the world's famous<br/>Red Comet!")
('Maxim', 'Killing me would be a slight to all of racing—no, for<br/>all of humani...ty—')
('Maxim', 'Aidios, save me!')
('Aaron', 'Get a load of this guy.')
('Van', "He's got the reflexes of a racer, all right.")
('Feri', 'With those skills, maybe he can escape on his own.')
('Agnès', "W-We can't just leave him here!")
('Elaine', "Agreed. Let's move in to assist.")
('Van', "How's it hangin', hot shot?")
('Maxim', 'What are you all doing here? Have you come to<br/>rescue me?')
('Van', 'Maybe. How about you lure those guys into a line for<br/>me real quick-like?')
('Maxim', "You're using me as bait?!")
('Van', "I'm just messin' with you—but you better hurry.<br/>That one on the left is gainin' on you.")
('Maxim', 'Are you joking or not?!')
('Elaine', "(Van's still doing this...?)")
('Agnès', '(I guess some things never change.)')
('Aaron', "Let's kick some metallic ass!")
('Feri', 'Engaging hostiles!')
('Maxim', "I have some choice words for you, but I'll put<br/>them aside. You did save me, after all.")
('Elaine', 'It was unwise of you to trespass into a restricted area.')
('Elaine', "Still, I'm glad to see you're all right.")
('Maxim', "Do my eyes deceive me? Aren't you Elaine Auclair?!")
('Elaine', 'Well, yes.')
('Maxim', 'What a fascinating twist of fate it is that we would<br/>finally meet like this!')
('Maxim', 'Say, have you read that all the gossip magazines voted<br/>us the top celebrity couple in the making?')
('Elaine', '*sigh* Is this really the time?')
('Maxim', '...No, I suppose not.')
(40302, '(This guy, I swear...)')
(40301, '(I feel dumb for being impressed when he bought us<br/>time to escape earlier.)')
('Feri', '(I guess whatever respect he earned is gone now.)')
('Agnès', '(W-Well, at least he lived to try to be<br/>better...eventually.)')
('Aaron', 'Urgh...')
('Van', "You sure you're okay? Could always hitch a ride back<br/>with these guys.")
('Aaron', "How many times do I have to tell you I'm fine?<br/>You're so freaking nosy.")
('Aaron', "Let's just focus on—")
('Melchior', "Oh? Aren't we the perceptive one? And here I<br/>thought I'd hidden myself pretty well.")
('Feri', "I-It's him...!")
('Agnès', 'The man we met in Creil.')
('Van', "You're just about the last person I wanted to run<br/>into here.")
('Van', 'Gotta say, though, surprised to see you in one piece<br/>after the Direwolf went after you.')
('Melchior', 'His persistence was nothing to scoff at, believe<br/>you me.')
('Melchior', "After I shook him off, I figured I'd check in on my<br/>darling comrades.")
('Melchior', "And I have to admit, they've put together a<br/>compelling production, don't you think?")
('Elaine', 'Please clear the area.')
('Maxim', 'R-Right.')
('Feri', "You're the one who killed Aida!")
('Melchior', "Oh, the little one's here as well. Congrats on the<br/>career change, by the way.")
('Melchior', 'War is such a fickle business, after all. An ally today<br/>could be an undead you have to strike<br/>down tomorrow. ❤')
('Feri', 'Y-You shut your mouth!')
('Aaron', "What's up with Minty Fresh here?")
('Agnès', "He's like Viola and Alexandre from before.")
('Melchior', "Silly me. I haven't introduced myself to the<br/>new arrivals.")
('Melchior', "I'm one of Almata's three executives—the deadly yet<br/>beautiful Melchior of the Thorns!")
('Melchior', "Don't feel the need to return the introductions,<br/>though. Your reputations precede you both.")
('Aaron', 'Hmph.')
('Elaine', 'So...it really is you.')
('Melchior', "I know I said earlier that I'd only dropped by to check<br/>in on my fellow executives...")
('Melchior', "...but since that big bad wolf chased me away from<br/>our last fight, I've been pent up something fierce.")
('Melchior', "Now, I'm faced by a stage set with such an<br/>enticing cast. How could I possibly resist?")
('Aaron', "Then, let's draw this curtain and get the show on<br/>the road.")
('Feri', 'Aida, please watch over me. I will avenge you!')
('Melchior', 'Oh, I can barely contain myself any longer, so...shall<br/>we dance?')
('Elaine', 'En garde!')
('Van', "Give this all you've got! Hear me?!")
('Agnès', 'Right!')
('Feri', '...!')
('Aaron', 'Tch...')
('Melchior', 'Oh, dear!')
('Van', 'Bah!')
('Agnès', '...!')
('Van', 'Elaine!')
('Elaine', 'Hyaaa!')
('Melchior', 'Hahaha! No wonder you put up a fight against<br/>the boss!')
('Elaine', 'So that WAS him!')
('Elaine', 'Van! Go on ahead!')
('Elaine', "I'll hold him here and allow the civilians to escape!")
('Van', 'All right! Come with me, guys!')
('Agnès', 'Please stay safe!')
('Feri', 'Sorry for leaving this all to you.')
('Aaron', 'We owe you one!')
('Alexandre', '...')
('Viola', 'Hmph.')
('Melchior', 'Golly! All that hard work, and elders live to be old<br/>another day!')
('Melchior', "Sure, we accomplished our real goal here, but I have a<br/>feeling the boss won't be too happy.")
('Alexandre', 'A failure is a failure. The boss may respond as<br/>he sees fit.')
('Viola', "Hey, Melchior! Don't think I've forgotten this is all<br/>your fault for screwing up in Creil!")
('Melchior', 'Heheh. It is what it is. Though, I did stumble on an<br/>ideal venue in the process.')
('Alexandre', 'In the meantime, we must focus. The next battle is<br/>fast approaching.')
('Viola', "Ugh, don't remind me. I don't like having to work<br/>with those two.")
('Melchior', 'Be nice to your teammates, children! Even if they are<br/>a little cuckoo.')
('Viola', "It's rich for you of all people to be calling<br/>someone crazy.")
('Alexandre', 'If either of them fought at full strength, they could<br/>dispatch an entire army singlehandedly.')
('Melchior', "Well, they'll have a chance to whip out those toys of<br/>theirs before too long.")
('Melchior', "Perhaps we'll even run into that spriggan again.<br/>It's almost like fate...")
('Van', "No turnin' back now. We gotta settle this.")
('Aaron', 'Damn straight!')
