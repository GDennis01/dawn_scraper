('Feri', "Wow! The scenery here's beautiful!")
('Feri', "Everything's so green... You don't get a view like this<br/>anywhere I live.")
('Agnès', "Heehee. Oh, there isn't much like this near the<br/>capital, either.")
('Agnès', "We haven't passed another car in ages—it makes it<br/>feel like we have the whole picturesque view<br/>to ourselves.")
('Van', "That's how it goes on an old country road.")
('Van', "But we're makin' good time. If we keep going like<br/>this, we'll be there in time for lunch—")
('Van', '...')
('Agnès', 'Is something wrong, Van?')
('Feri', "Something's not right up ahead.")
('Van', "Might be a kid, but you're not a Kruga warrior for<br/>nothin', huh?")
('Van', "I'm gonna pull over. Be ready for a fight.")
('Agnès', 'A-All right...')
('Isla', 'Th-That was a close one... We were almost scarily<br/>close to that truck.')
('Judith', 'Still, at least the plan worked. We managed to get out<br/>of the city like we wanted to.')
('Agnès', 'Where exactly are we now?')
('Van', "It's an old road that barely anyone uses since the<br/>expressway was built.")
('Van', "It's not technically a secret path, but it might as<br/>well be.")
('Judith', 'That explains it...')
('Isla', 'It looks like the police certainly know of it. This must<br/>be the final obstacle standing between us and<br/>the suburbs.')
('Van', "(We can't use the same tactic over and over again.<br/>So I'm thinkin'...)")
('Agnès', "Wait. You can't mean to...")
('Van', "We've gotten through a few checkpoints now.<br/>It's possible they're on to us at this point.")
('Van', "If that's true, they're gonna arrest us if we stop here.")
('Judith', "So we've got no choice but to force our way through?")
('Isla', "If that's what you think is best, I'm ready for it.")
('Isla', "I'm not afraid as long as I'm with all of you.")
('Judith', "Oh, wow! To think you'd come to trust us that much<br/>in so short a time.")
('Isla', "You've both done so much to reassure me while we've<br/>been together. At this point, I don't even know where<br/>I'd BE without you.")
('Agnès', 'Aww...')
('Isla', "O-Of course, we wouldn't have got this far without<br/>your driving, too, Mr. Arkride!")
('Van', "It's fine. I'm used to it.")
('Van', "Anyway, if you've steeled your nerves, then we're<br/>ready to go.")
('Agnès', "We're going to reunite you with your family—<br/>whatever it takes.")
('Isla', "Thank you all so much. I'll never forget the debt I<br/>owe you.")
('Van', "Easy. Save the thanks until the job's done.")
('Van', "Okay, let's do this. Don't bite your tongue.")
('System', 'They soon reached the outskirts of the city.')
('System', "Isla's family came to meet her, and upon entrusting<br/>her with them, the job was considered complete.")
('System', "Before departing, however, they said that they were<br/>praying for her grandmother's safe recovery.")
('System', 'They also suggested that Isla stay in Anchorville<br/>until the national situation had calmed down.')
('System', "On the way back, they decided to rely on Quatre and<br/>Risette's analyses and navigational expertise...")
('System', '...and through some effort, they were able to find a<br/>safe but slow route to make their way back into<br/>the city.')
('System', 'Quest A Return Home completed!')
('System', 'Earned')
('System', 'Received')
