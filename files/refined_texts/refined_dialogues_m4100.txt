('Van', 'Will this area do the trick?')
('Risette', 'Yes. It should be perfect.')
('Feri', "What's that?")
('Aaron', "What's that?")
('Risette', 'Parabolic shards expanded. Initiating<br/>satellite communications.')
('Feri', 'What is THAT?!')
('Aaron', 'Holy shit...')
('Feri', "I didn't just imagine that, did I?")
('Aaron', "That wasn't what I thought it was, was it?")
('Van', 'A low-altitude communications satellite flying 900<br/>selge off the ground, under the sea of stars.')
('Van', "One of the many cutting-edge orbments you guys're<br/>operating in secret, huh?")
('Risette', 'Indeed. Verne aided in its development, and the<br/>president of Calvard has given its use his<br/>tacit approval.')
('Risette', 'As long as we continue reporting data on its<br/>usage, admittedly.')
('Van', 'Sounds like him, all right.')
('Van', 'So this is how you report to HQ without the risk of<br/>anyone listening in?')
('Risette', "That's correct. I don't believe communicating using<br/>Basel's orbal network to be safe at this point in time.")
('Risette', 'As a Code E matter, the main AI in our headquarters<br/>will begin analysis and threat level determination as<br/>soon as it has received the proper data.')
('Van', "Must make things easy just havin' a computer do<br/>everything for you.")
('Feri', 'Van... Risette...')
('Aaron', "Tch. Something about that just doesn't sit right<br/>with me.")
('Van', "There's two sides to every coin, as the saying goes.")
('Van', "Marduk ain't the only one whose tech level is off<br/>the charts.")
('Van', "Hell, it's not even tech. It goes for martial arts, magic,<br/>and the like, too.")
('Van', "The Geneses and Almata aren't much different.")
('Van', "But whether something's above board or not, it all<br/>comes down to how you choose to grapple with it.")
('Van', 'You should try and keep that in mind.')
('Feri', 'We are all like flames given life by the Goddess, but it<br/>is we who determine how we shine...')
('Feri', "I'll give what you're saying some thought—together<br/>with all of you.")
('Van', "That's good enough for me.")
('Aaron', '...Sure. Loud and clear, Professor Arkride.')
('Aaron', "I was forced to grapple with that damn Tyrant.<br/>I know what I'm doing on that front.")
('Van', 'Heh. Yeah, I suppose you do.')
('Van', "You don't mind me tellin' the other two all that's<br/>happened here, by the way?")
('Risette', 'By all means.')
('Risette', "Whether it's permitted under our company rules is a<br/>gray area...but that is the Arkride Solutions way,<br/>isn't it?")
('Van', "Haha. Look at that. Seems I can't stop rubbin' off<br/>on people.")
('Risette', "So I've noticed.")
('Quatre', 'Good evening, everyone.')
('Quatre', "I'm sorry for bothering you so late. I thought you<br/>would be in for the night by now.")
('Van', "Oh, it's you.<br/>(Wait...)")
('Risette', '(He may have seen the satellite from the<br/>observatory, yes.)')
('Quatre', '...Hmm? I was just calling to ask for your help<br/>with something.')
('Quatre', 'Umm... So, over at the institute not too long ago,<br/>we—')
('Van', "Got it. We're meetin' at the main gate, right?<br/>We'll be there in twenty.")
('Feri', "We'll have to let Aaron know, too!")
('Aaron', 'We should grab small fry on the way there.')
('Viola', 'Heh heh. The preparations are coming along nicely.<br/>This is going to be fun.')
('Viola', "Much as I wish we didn't have to leave most of the<br/>execution to that filthy worm.")
('Olympia', 'He is an overseer much like myself. I am sure he will<br/>play his role perfectly.')
('Olympia', 'Just take care not to let the window of opportunity<br/>pass you by.')
('Viola', "Hmph. Who do you think you're talking<br/>to, puppeteer? As if I would fail.")
('Alexandre', 'This battlefield will soon be an essential part of the<br/>preparations for our endgame.')
('Alexandre', 'I will be looking forward to seeing what you can do as<br/>well, golden one.')
('Olympia', 'I shall do whatever my contract asks of me.<br/>Farewell for now.')
(500, 'October 24th, 1:10PM')
('Van', 'Here we are. Keep your eyes peeled.')
('Feri', 'Got it!')
('Feri', "Thinking about it, that's the first time we ever got to<br/>drive somewhere as a group.")
('Agnès', "Now that you mention it, you're right. The truck is<br/>much more comfortable now, too.")
('Quatre', "Yeah. You've clearly done more than just expand the<br/>vehicle's capacity, huh?")
('Quatre', "You must've spent quite a lot of time and mira<br/>customizing it.")
('Van', 'You can tell? Yeah, the suspension is the main<br/>thing—')
('Aaron', 'Nope. Not interested. Anyway, we came here, but...')
('Aaron', 'Nope. Not interested. Anyway, we came here, but...')
('Agnès', 'I almost forgot you were here last night.')
('Agnès', "Wasn't that because of Risette's...?")
('Risette', "It's quite all right. I'm sure Mr. Salision is well aware.")
('Quatre', "You're talking about that Marduk satellite? Yeah, I<br/>know about it.")
('Quatre', 'You were the one communicating with it, then?')
('Risette', "My apologies. I didn't intend to disturb<br/>your stargazing.")
('Quatre', "Don't worry about it. It's bothered me before, but we<br/>need all the support we can get right now.")
('Feri', 'Look! FIO and XEROS are here to help!')
('Aaron', "Huh. So the robo-mutt's here to hang out, too?")
('Van', "He's good for ground combat, right? Can see him<br/>being a big asset here.")
('Quatre', 'Oh, without a doubt.')
('Quatre', "We're going to explore the canyon, FIO. And I want<br/>you to remain vigilant of our surroundings, XEROS.")
('FIO', 'Understood, Quatre.')
('XEROS', 'GRR... RUFF!')
('Agnès', 'So our destination is the outdoor experiment complex<br/>at the other end of this road, right?')
('Feri', "That's right—but we're sure to run into monsters on<br/>the way. Be careful!")
('System', 'Quatre can now use the craft <br/>.')
('Van', 'There it is.')
('Agnès', 'It looks so dilapidated...')
('Quatre', "It's the perfect place to conduct field research for the<br/>natural sciences, though.")
('Aaron', "I get what you mean, but it sure doesn't LOOK like<br/>there's cutting-edge research being done in it.")
('Feri', 'I can see some relatively recent footprints and tracks<br/>on the ground.')
('Risette', 'So if nothing else, it has certainly been in use.')
('Van', "Yeah. I wouldn't be surprised if that professor was<br/>being held hostage here.")
('Quatre', "Well, we'll find out soon en—")
('Agnès', 'A-A giant avian monster?!')
('Feri', 'It looks like a giant Gryeam! Be careful!')
('Van', 'This area must be its turf. Time to take it out!')
('Quatre', 'Ugh... Back me up, FIO! XEROS!')
('FIO', 'Understood, Quatre!')
('XEROS', 'RUFF!')
('Risette', 'That takes care of it. Good work, everyone.')
('Van', "That was rough... Somethin' up, Quatre?")
('Quatre', "Well, it's just that this area is absolutely used for field<br/>research by the institute on a regular basis...")
('Quatre', "...and yet I've never once heard reports of monsters<br/>like that one showing up here.")
('Quatre', 'That goes for the monsters we found in the mining<br/>tunnel, too...')
('Aaron', "So we've got monsters popping up all over in places<br/>they really shouldn't be?")
('Van', 'Hmm... One possibility does come to mind.')
('Van', "Could be the abnormality's actually far below us.")
('Agnès', 'What do you mean?')
('Quatre', 'Why below...?')
('Risette', '...You are as sharp as ever, Mr. Arkride.')
('Risette', "I didn't expect you to connect this to the many other<br/>disturbances across this continent in recent years.<br/>Not so quickly, at least.")
('Van', "I'm just goin' off hearsay, though. I'm guessin' you're<br/>a lot more in the know about 'em than I am.")
('Risette', 'There have been numerous cases in the past few years<br/>of disturbances in the septium veins<br/>causing abnormalities.')
('Risette', "During Erebonia's civil and international wars, or<br/>Crossbell's unilateral independence declaration and<br/>recent occupation, for example.")
('Feri', 'Septium veins...?')
('Aaron', 'I remember hearing about them in the past<br/>from Gien. Something about them flowing under the<br/>continent and being the source of all life.')
('Aaron', "They're called 'dragon veins' in the East.")
('Risette', 'Indeed. Interference with the septium veins has<br/>produced a number of distinctive phenomena.')
('Risette', 'Among them is the emergence of new monsters, as<br/>well as existing ones becoming noticeably<br/>more aggressive.')
('Risette', "It has also resulted in the appearance of giant<br/>monsters from a higher plane known as 'cryptids.'")
('Quatre', 'Th-This is all news to me...')
('Agnès', "That does sound similar to what's happening here.")
('Agnès', "Assuming there IS a connection, then what's<br/>happening here in Basel...")
('Van', "There's still no signs of life inside the building.<br/>If someone was in there, I'd figure that battle<br/>would've drawn them out.")
('Van', "It looks like we might've come here for nothing, but<br/>we still might find somethin' useful in there.")
('Quatre', 'Yeah. I think we should have a good look inside just<br/>in case.')
('Feri', '...?')
('Aaron', "There's rust everywhere...and not a soul to be seen.")
('Van', "That PC over there's plugged in. There's a cable<br/>connecting it to the orbal network, even.")
('Quatre', 'I wonder if that belonged to Professor Callaghan.')
('Agnès', "Does it seem like you'll be able to get anything off<br/>of it?")
('Quatre', "...I'm afraid not. He's got it locked down hard.")
('Risette', 'Allow me. My scanning software should have us<br/>inside within ten minutes or so.')
('Quatre', "Incredible... You're so fast and yet so precise at the<br/>same time.")
('Risette', 'Thank you.')
('Quatre', "(Almost TOO fast. It's almost like she's...)")
('Van', 'Huh.')
('Quatre', "This looks to be Professor Callaghan's notes about<br/>the past few weeks.")
('Quatre', "'I have finally found the investor I have been seeking.'")
('System', 'We exchanged messages a few times over the orbal<br/>network before a representative from the Anchorville<br/>Company came to visit me directly.')
('System', "I already suspected that they were affiliated with the<br/>infamous 'A,' and sure enough, he freely admitted<br/>as much.")
('System', 'He offered to give me almost unlimited funding in<br/>exchange for performing an experiment under certain<br/>special conditions.')
('System', 'If I were to agree to all of those conditions, it would<br/>change everything.')
('System', 'It would dramatically increase the speed at which I<br/>can do my research—fundamentally alter what<br/>is possible.')
('System', 'After much thought and soul searching, I agreed to a<br/>portion of their conditions in order to finally take<br/>back my place ahead of Cronkite.')
('System', 'These are the bare minimum of conditions required<br/>for me to prevail.')
('System', 'By using parallel-distributed computing to harness<br/>the resources of the entire city, the preparations for<br/>my task are almost complete.')
('System', 'However, there is still a vast wall that needs to<br/>be overcome.')
('System', 'Climbing this wall is nigh impossible—at least,<br/>not without accepting their final condition<br/>as well.')
('System', 'I suspect I will have to wrestle with what to do on<br/>that front until the very end...but come what may, I<br/>must succeed. I must.')
('Quatre', 'For my goal is the realization of the seemingly<br/>impossible: the creation of nuclear weapons.')
('Quatre', '...')
('Agnès', 'Quatre...')
('Aaron', 'Hmph. Looks like we struck gold here after all.')
('Van', 'That professor with the glasses was right.')
('Van', "...This doesn't change anything, right? You still don't<br/>think it's possible he could actually pull off what he's<br/>claiming he can?")
('Risette', 'Absolutely not. Not with modern technology.')
('Risette', 'He would need to have stumbled upon something<br/>truly epoch-making to change that.')
('Risette', 'A huge paradigm shift. Another singularity, to use as<br/>an example.')
('Quatre', 'Even if that did happen, a lengthy process of testing,<br/>theorizing, and such would still be needed.')
('Quatre', "That's likely why Professor Epstein and his disciples<br/>never realized the technology, either.")
('Quatre', "...No. I think it's more likely that they deliberately<br/>chose not to even try.")
('Feri', 'Still, those notes made it sound like he was close...')
('Agnès', 'Like he was only a step or two away, yes.')
('Agnès', "He mentioned parallel-distributed computing, too—<br/>although I couldn't hazard a guess as to what that<br/>'final condition' he mentions could be.")
('Quatre', 'Perhaps it refers to some kind of AI so advanced it<br/>could eliminate the need for decades of work?')
('Quatre', 'But how would they even create or obtain such<br/>a thing?')
('Risette', '...')
('Van', "Well, I think we've found all we're gonna find here.<br/>We should get back to the city.")
('Agnès', 'I agree. Perhaps the CID, guild, or Renne might be<br/>able to help—')
('Aaron', '...What was that?')
('Risette', 'It sounded like the water splashing outside.')
('Feri', "It must've come from the swamp out front.")
('Van', '...Maybe we should look into it—just in case.')
('Feri', 'Over there!')
('Risette', '...')
('Aaron', '...Tch.')
('Van', "Agnès! Quatre! Don't look!")
('Quatre', '...')
('Agnès', "No... This can't...")
('Quatre', 'Pro...<br/>PROFESSOR CALLAGHAN!')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', 'The cause of death was drowning.')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', 'I suspect he was knocked unconscious before being<br/>thrown into the swamp.')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', 'Send the body for an autopsy right away.')
(40301, "Yes, ma'am!")
('Bracer Alvis', 'Hold on a minute!')
('Van', "...I'll leave this to you.")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', 'Of course you will. This is out of your jurisdiction.')
('Bracer Alvis', "Why's a murder happening all the way out here?<br/>Just what are you people covering up?!")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', 'We are currently conducting an investigation.<br/>This area is off limits—')
('Bracer Alvis', "We don't need your permission when a civilian<br/>is dead! Our code is all the permission we need!")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "Don't you realize this murder could go<br/>unsolved if you charge in and start disturbing the<br/>crime scene?!")
('Aaron', '...The pieces are just about coming together.')
('Van', 'Yeah. His abduction from the lab yesterday pointed<br/>in that direction, too...')
('Van', "...but it's now crystal clear he made a deal with the<br/>mafia—and this is the end result.")
('Agnès', "It's Tharbad all over again...")
('Risette', 'The motive then was to stop the victim from talking<br/>and to make an example of him. Is it the same here,<br/>I wonder?')
('Quatre', 'How can all of you be so calm?')
('Quatre', 'Someone was just murdered...')
('Feri', "Oh, trust me—I'm burning with anger on the inside.")
('Aaron', "Those bastards have screwed us over again and<br/>again—and this is the perfect chance to make 'em pay<br/>for it.")
('Quatre', "So you do understand what I'm feeling...")
('Agnès', "They do, yes. They've both been through a lot.")
('Van', "...I'm sorry about what happened to the professor.")
('Van', "But we've been findin' more and more clues, which<br/>means we're probably gettin' to the heart of<br/>the matter.")
('Van', "Which also means this ain't over—not yet. We've got<br/>to keep our cool if we're gonna get to the bottom<br/>of this.")
('Van', "We can't pay 'em back with a hot head.")
('Quatre', '...')
('Van', "Pretty sure the key to solving all of this is gonna be<br/>the 'final condition' he mentioned in his notes.")
('Van', 'You remember the chaos in Crossbell a year and a<br/>half ago, right?')
('Van', 'This is an oversimplification, but it all came about as<br/>the result of a technological singularity.')
('Van', "Said singularity gave birth to superintelligence far<br/>beyond humanity's current capabilities.")
('Van', 'Then after everything came to an end, it was<br/>lost again.')
('Agnès', "Th-That's quite a lot to take in...")
('Aaron', "How do you even learn this shit? And you think we're<br/>dealing with tech like that here?")
('Risette', 'No. It was well established by multiple sources that it<br/>is impossible to replicate the technology that was lost.')
('Risette', "Of course, that doesn't preclude the possibility of<br/>humanity creating it themselves at some point in<br/>the future...")
('Risette', "...but that could be decades or centuries in the<br/>future—and even a year and a half ago, nuclear<br/>weapons hadn't been created.")
('Agnès', '...')
('Aaron', "So it's a similar deal as what happened then but still<br/>fundamentally different at its core...")
('Feri', "(Ugh... It's hard keeping up with all of this...)")
('Feri', "You don't think the Geneses could be what makes it<br/>different, do you?")
('Agnès', '...!')
('Aaron', "Heh. That's a good point.")
('Van', "Yeah. I'd say you're on the right track, there.")
('Van', "A puzzle piece that didn't exist in Crossbell then, but<br/>IS part of what's happening now.")
('Van', "The prototype orbments that're even more of an<br/>enigma than artifacts and capable of bringin'<br/>about miracles.")
('Van', 'If we assume they ARE involved here...')
('Van', '...then it makes you wonder just what a final<br/>condition with them in the mix would look like.')
('Quatre', 'Ah...')
('Risette', '...So it does.')
('Agnès', 'That does seem like a valid approach.')
('Aaron', 'Heh. Not bad, small fry.')
('Feri', "Heehee... Thanks.<br/>(I still don't know what's going on, though.)")
('Quatre', "(We've already established that the issues with the<br/>orbal network in Basel were caused by<br/>parallel-distributed computing.)")
('Quatre', '(Then we have Professor Callaghan developing<br/>nuclear weapons, which was thought to be impossible,<br/>before being murdered...)')
('Quatre', '(Plus the fact that this is so similar and yet so<br/>different to what happened in Crossbell...)')
('Professor Hamilton', 'Should you ever find yourself stuck when trying to<br/>solve a problem, take a step back and look at the<br/>bigger picture.')
('Professor Hamilton', 'That applies to more than just research, too,<br/>you know. It will be the key to finding your answer.')
('Quatre', "(No... That final condition couldn't be...)")
('Agnès', "...Hmm? I wonder who's calling.")
('Renne', 'Agnès! Thank goodness—I finally got through.')
('Agnès', "R-Renne? What's wrong?")
('Van', "Don't tell me you already learned what we found.")
('Renne', "Never mind that. That's just a diversion!")
('Renne', "Hurry back to the city right away! There's a tea party<br/>getting started over here!")
('Agnès', 'There are archaisms running amok in the city?!')
('Risette', 'They must have been purchased from the<br/>black market.')
('Renne', "They've only just arrived, fortunately, so we should be<br/>able to hold the fort until you get back.")
('Renne', 'But you have to hurry...')
('Agnès', 'Renne! Renne!')
('Van', 'We got cut off, huh?')
('Risette', "The signal must be experiencing interference...or<br/>perhaps it's due to the generators malfunctioning.")
('Quatre', "Wh-Why were they glowing like that?!<br/>What's happening?!")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "We've just heard the news, too!")
('Bracer Alvis', "What the hell's going on?!")
('Feri', 'Look!')
('Aaron', "It's Almata's high-speed airship!")
('Van', 'Tch! Hop in—now!')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "We're heading back, too! I want you to take care of<br/>preserving the crime scene and letting everyone else<br/>know what's happened!")
(40302, "Y-Yes, ma'am!")
('Bracer Regina', "I can't get in touch with the guild, either!")
('Bracer Alvis', "Ugh... Then let's just get back to the city!")
('Quatre', 'Nice work, you two.')
('XEROS', 'RUFF!')
('FIO', 'The same to you, Quatre.')
('Aaron', 'That dog of yours is a hell of a beast, huh?')
('Feri', "Yeah! He's just as tough as any military monster I've<br/>ever seen.")
('Agnès', "FIO's support is proving a valuable asset in<br/>battle, too.")
('Quatre', "Thanks—though I wasn't the only one who<br/>made them. I had the rest of my family's help.")
('Quatre', 'Life was so much fun in those days. The professor<br/>was still in Basel, Yang and Essy were around...')
('Quatre', '...Supervisor Giscard was always there to support us,<br/>and—and Professor Callaghan was so nice to<br/>everyone, too...')
('Agnès', 'Quatre...')
('Risette', 'Professor Hamilton left the Republic roughly two and<br/>a half years ago to assist with the environmental issues<br/>in the East, correct?')
('Quatre', 'Yeah. She did the right thing for the future of<br/>Zemuria, but a lot has changed for the worse here<br/>since then.')
('Quatre', "She would say Yang is the greatest mind to be born<br/>since her own teacher, and that's made clear with his<br/>weapons development work for the government.")
('Quatre', "Now he's shifted focus to some other mystery project<br/>that I'm sure will be incredible.")
('Quatre', "Essy's mostly focused on developing new technology<br/>in the field of medicine now. She's always been one<br/>for getting lost in her own world.")
('Van', 'Professor Callaghan was the top engineer of his<br/>generation, but he ended up getting surpassed by<br/>Professor Cronkite.')
('Van', 'Which is what eventually led to our current mess...')
('Quatre', "Yeah... I promised Gran I'd take care of things in her<br/>absence, but I haven't done a good job at all.")
('Quatre', "I don't know how I'm going to face her when she<br/>comes back.")
('Quatre', "...I-I'm sorry. Just forget I said anything.")
('Feri', '...Hmm?')
('Agnès', "By 'Gran,' you mean Professor Hamilton, right?")
('Aaron', "Aww. You try and come across as a big man, but<br/>you're just gwammie's baby boy at the end of the<br/>day, huh?")
('Quatre', "I-I wouldn't go that far! She's family, so I care about<br/>her a lot—that's all!")
('Quatre', 'She, Yang, and Essy might not be my family by<br/>blood, but they are in every other sense.')
('Risette', 'I see...')
('Aaron', '...Heh.')
('Van', "Anyway, this isn't any place to be standing around<br/>flappin' our jaws. Let's move on.")
('Feri', "We're going in the right direction here, aren't we?")
('Quatre', "As far as I remember, yeah. I've been here before, but<br/>not many times.")
('Van', 'No reaction from it at all?')
('Agnès', 'Not even a little, no.')
('Aaron', "We're just gonna have to keep pressing on, then.")
('Quatre', 'Are you talking about the Genesis that you showed<br/>us earlier?')
('Agnès', "Yes. We have reason to believe the Genesi are in<br/>some way connected to what's happening here.")
('Quatre', 'I really wish I knew a bit more about them...')
('Quatre', 'How did you even end up with something belonging<br/>to Professor Epstein?')
('Agnès', 'Well...')
('System', 'Agnès gave Quatre a brief summary of her<br/>background and all the crises the Geneses had<br/>caused thus far.')
('Quatre', "So you're Professor Epstein's great-granddaughter...")
('Quatre', 'You know, I do remember hearing from Professor<br/>Hamilton that he had an adopted daughter who<br/>went missing.')
('Agnès', 'That would be my grandmother, yes. She passed<br/>when I was younger, however.')
('Quatre', "Those words at the end of Professor Epstein's diaries<br/>certainly are worrying—as is all the trouble you say<br/>they've caused.")
('Quatre', "Even if Professor Epstein did make them, I can't<br/>believe how much they seem to be capable of.")
('Quatre', "We still don't know what they'll be used for here in<br/>Basel, either...")
('Risette', "Even if we assume they are involved here, we still<br/>don't know how they'll tie in to what is happening.")
('Quatre', "...Yeah. And there doesn't seem to be a clear pattern<br/>we can deduce from all of the other cases to guide us.")
('Van', "Actually, I might as well ask. You don't think having<br/>somethin' like that would let them develop impossible<br/>tech, right?")
('Quatre', "No. It's highly unlikely.")
('Quatre', "There are exceptions, like whatever happened a year<br/>and a half ago—which I don't know much about,<br/>I'll admit.")
('Quatre', 'But that was a very special case.')
('Quatre', 'None of the technology that was used back then has<br/>been used since.')
('Quatre', 'Technology is almost always developed in a clear,<br/>progressive manner—without any large gaps or<br/>sudden leaps.')
('Agnès', 'Umm... How do you explain the Orbal<br/>Revolution, then?')
('Quatre', 'I believe those devices then were only used to learn<br/>how orbal phenomena worked...')
('Quatre', '...as well as to learn how to apply those<br/>phenomena elsewhere.')
('Quatre', "They didn't create new technology from scratch so<br/>much as improve the development environment and<br/>enable it to become what it was.")
('Quatre', 'Which in itself is a...significant...')
('Risette', "So that may be what we're dealing with.")
('Quatre', "You can't create new technology out of nowhere<br/>like magic.")
('Quatre', 'However, if you can somehow create a development<br/>environment that defies common sense...')
('Van', "It's all fallin' into place now.")
('Quatre', 'Exactly!')
('Aaron', "Sounds like we haven't got time to waste!")
('Feri', 'Right!')
('Agnès', 'So this is the path through Auge Canyon.<br/>It certainly fits the name.')
('Risette', 'The terrain off the paved path appears to be<br/>quite complex.')
('Van', "Watch your footing, guys, or you're gonna be flyin'<br/>headfirst into the river.")
('Feri', 'You could take this road to the Liberl<br/>Kingdom, right?')
('Risette', 'If you wanted, yes—though it would take you several<br/>hours to get there even by vehicle.')
('Risette', 'On the other side of the border is a fortress in the<br/>Zeiss region.')
('Van', 'Signs like these really make it clear just how far from<br/>the capital we are.')
('Van', "We've been jumpin' all over the country so<br/>much lately... Sheesh.")
('Aaron', "You're just happy to have an excuse to drive around<br/>and you know it.")
('Van', "Hey, I'm a simple guy.")
('Van', "Well, let's get that holo core test started, shall we?")
('Agnès', 'Our task is to equip Pocel and act five times<br/>while S-Boosted.')
('Feri', "Right! Let's go!")
('System', 'Change your holo core by pressing  in the<br/>Orbment menu.')
