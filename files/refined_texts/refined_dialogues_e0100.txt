('Commander Geraint', 'This here will be the turning point! All units,<br/>assume the Dual Lancer formation!')
(40601, 'Ja!')
('Vice Chief Hasan', "We won't be defeated! Shine, Falcons of<br/>the Sun!")
(40451, 'Sir!')
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'Regimental commander of the Eisenschild,<br/>Geraint Reigar!')
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'We are open to accepting your offer for a<br/>ceasefire! How does a 7:3 split sound?')
('Commander Geraint', 'Vice Chief of the Warriors of Kruga,<br/>Hasan Al-Fayed!')
('Commander Geraint', 'We will accept no less than 6:4! Fail to<br/>accept, and the fighting continues!')
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'Very well! 6:4 to us it is!')
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'Glory to the Kruga! Glory to Arusha!')
(40451, 'YEEEAH!')
('Feri', '*pant* *pant*')
('Aida', 'That works, I guess. I figured more it was gonna end<br/>in a draw.')
('Aida', 'Your counterattack was really good—just lacking that<br/>bit of oomph at the end.')
('Aida', "If you'd seen my attempt to throw you off balance<br/>coming, you'd've had a slew of more strategic options<br/>to work with.")
('Feri', "*pant* *pant* You're... You're right.")
('Feri', 'Thanks...*pant*...Aida.')
('Aida', "Think nothing of it. You've got a lot of potential—<br/>you just need more practice and to up your stamina.")
('Aida', "With enough of both, you'll be right on the heels of<br/>my other little sister from back in the day in no time.")
('Feri', 'Do you mean Sylphid?')
('Feri', "I'd still like to know more about her.")
('Feri', 'Oh! Hey! That tickles!')
('Aida', "Heehee. I can't help it! I see this hair and I just get<br/>the urge to ruffle it.")
('Aida', "Hmm... Well, next time we meet off the battlefield,<br/>I'll tell you about my old corps.")
('Aida', "Zephyr's got a whole lotta stories in it to tell.")
('Feri', 'Awesome! Better make that a promise!')
('Feri', 'Ugh... Not yet!')
('Aida', 'Heh. Too easy!')
('Feri', 'Ahh!')
('Aida', "I've got you!")
('Feri', 'O flames...')
('Feri', '...become one with me!')
('Aida', '...?!')
('Feri', '...')
('Aida', 'Well, look at that. Guess we lost this one, huh?')
