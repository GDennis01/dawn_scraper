(500, 'November 14th, 11:25AM')
('Yumé', 'Whoaaa! Those are big rocks!')
('Quatre', "That's called a mountain range. I've seen photos of<br/>this one, but it's even more impressive in person.")
('Risette', 'There are two in this area: the Tianshan Mountains<br/>in the north and the Ishgal Mountains in the south.')
('Risette', 'Both serve as the dividing line between central<br/>Zemuria and the East.')
('Feri', "Aren't they also known as the Solaris Mountains and<br/>the Kunlun Mountains?")
('Agnès', "Yes, that's right. People from the East call them<br/>Solaris and Kunlun.")
('Agnès', 'But Tianshan and Ishgal are the officially designated<br/>names at the behest of the church.')
('Feri', "Ahh. I got'cha.<br/>(She probably learned about that in class.)")
('Feri', "It's weird to think that my homeland is just on the<br/>other side. It's basically a hop, skip, and a jump away.")
('Van', "You'd have to jump pretty damn high to get over that<br/>mountain, though. Your home might as well be in a<br/>completely different world.")
('Aaron', 'Huh?')
('Aaron', '*whistle*!')
('Van', '(...?)')
('Yumé', 'That bike was super duper cool!')
('Aaron', "Man, I'd kill for a ride like that!")
('Feri', 'I thought I saw the ETWS label on it.')
('Quatre', 'Good eye. That man was riding one of the high-end<br/>models they released in the spring.')
('Quatre', 'You have to be quite large to ride one of those, and<br/>he was exactly that.')
('Risette', 'Indeed. He had an impressive physique for a man of<br/>his age.')
('Agnès', 'Hmm? Why the long face, Van?')
('Yumé', "What's wrong? Are you carsick or something?")
('Van', "Nah. Nothin' like that. Just got a bit of trauma with<br/>guys who ride around on big bikes.")
('Van', "Oh, and I ain't talkin' about Hermès. She's been a<br/>huge help. This issue's exclusive to dudes.")
('Feri', 'The Direwolf really did a number on your<br/>psyche, huh?')
('Aaron', "Something about that dude makes me want to deck<br/>him in the face. Maybe it's the shades.")
('Risette', 'That is inadvisable, Mr. Wei. He has been labeled as<br/>an S-class threat by the Marduk Company.')
('Quatre', "Wh-What? You're acquainted with an S-class threat?")
('Quatre', 'Your choice of clientele is...atypical, to say the least.')
('Van', "(...There's no way it could be him.)")
('Van', "(What a joke. This ain't even my hometown, and yet<br/>here I am gettin' all nostalgic over this shit.)")
('Agnès', '(Van looks to be lost in thought.)')
('Agnès', "(Well, he IS smiling, so maybe I shouldn't worry.)")
('Female Researcher?', "Yes, I've left Basel with the documents in hand.")
('Female Researcher?', 'I also procured the special tools and alloys—even if<br/>that WAS outside the scope of the mission...')
('Female Researcher?', '...but that aside, everything has gone according<br/>to plan.')
('Female Researcher?', "I will have to let you go for a moment. I'll call<br/>back shortly.")
('Risette', 'I believe we have found our perpetrator.')
('Aaron', "This is the honeytrap girl? Hmm... Yeah, I'd hit that.")
('Female Researcher?', 'Oh, dear. I thought my little ruse would have bought<br/>me more time.')
('Female Researcher?', 'You do not appear to be associated with the police<br/>or Marduk.')
('Female Researcher?', 'Perhaps you might be interested in negotiating? I can<br/>offer you a substantial reward if you let me go.')
('Van', 'Tempting, but nah.')
('Van', "Normally I'd be up for a little wheelin' and dealin',<br/>but I've got a pair of scrutinizing eyes on me.")
('Van', "'Fraid you're just gonna have to hand over the case.")
('Quatre', 'Just what exactly would you have done had I not<br/>tagged along?')
('Female Researcher?', 'Oh, my. A researcher from the institute is here, too?')
('Female Researcher?', "Well, I'm sorry to disappoint, but the case stays<br/>with me. I'll give you two options: go back to Basel<br/>empty handed—or return in body bags.")
('Feri', 'We will never agree to your terms!')
('Quatre', "I concur. We'll instead opt for the third option: fight!")
('Risette', '(That orbal gun design looks eerily familiar. It must<br/>be—)')
('Female Researcher?', "Well, don't say I didn't warn you.")
('Agnès', 'What?! She had monsters this whole time?!')
('Van', 'Someone came prepared.')
('Van', "Not like it'll make any difference, though. We'll make<br/>mincemeat out of 'em in seconds flat.")
('Female Researcher?', 'No way! How could I possibly have lost?!')
('Van', 'Checkmate. Now give up the goods.')
('Quatre', "And while you're at it, answer me this: what<br/>organization do you belong to? Who hired you?")
('Female Researcher?', '...')
('Risette', 'I can answer that in her stead. I recognize that<br/>particular gun model.')
('Risette', "She's likely associated with Zecht Arms.")
('Quatre', 'You mean that new weapons manufacturer?')
('Van', "If I'm remembering things right, their name started<br/>makin' the rounds during the war with the Empire.")
('Risette', 'Correct. They are similar to Marduk in<br/>some respects. Although, they are not nearly as large<br/>an enterprise.')
('Risette', "Their ambitions for weapons development, however,<br/>are quite ferocious. They've been aggressive with<br/>expanding their market share of late.")
('Van', "And now they're sendin' out spies to do their<br/>dirty work? Damn. That's low.")
('Quatre', "I can't say I disagree. Stealing technology from<br/>competitors is hardly an ethical business practice.")
('Female Researcher?', 'Tch...')
('Van', "Now, then. I suppose we'd better get this stuff back to<br/>our client.")
('Van', 'We should also take her back with us. Could you<br/>restrain her for me, Ferida?')
('Feri', 'On it!')
