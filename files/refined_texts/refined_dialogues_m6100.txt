('Agnès', 'That is one very large door.')
('Judith', "So I'm guessing this is our way in?")
('Van', "Yeah. We'll be doin' a lot of fighting on the other<br/>side of it.")
('Quatre', 'This device must be our keycard scanner.')
('Aaron', "We got a couple of side paths, too, and I sense<br/>monsters on both of 'em. This place is big.")
('Risette', 'Actually, judging by how sound is reverberating in<br/>here, I believe this area in particular is quite small.')
('Feri', "Then it won't take long to explore every nook<br/>and cranny. Let's hop to it!")
('Van', "This'll be a cinch with Master's help.")
('Van', "Couldn't ask for a better ally than the head of the<br/>Kunlun school. Lookin' forward to seeing you in<br/>action again.")
('Bergard', "And I'm looking forward to seeing how much my<br/>pupil has grown.")
('Agnès', 'Oh, my!')
('Feri', 'Watch out, everyone. That one means business!')
('Bergard', "I believe its placement here—a dead end—<br/>is deliberate. I'm inclined to believe we have to defeat<br/>it to proceed with the game.")
('Judith', "Yeah. That's probably how we get our 'right<br/>to participate.'")
('Van', "Then let's cut it down to size.")
('Van', 'Done and done.')
('Feri', 'Oh. Look at what it dropped.')
('Van', "That's gotta be our keycard.")
('Risette', 'Perfect. We can use it to open the door, then.')
('Quatre', 'It looks like a standard-issue security card, but it has<br/>a fairly modern design. Fascinating.')
('Agnès', 'Look, the Genesis is reacting to it.')
('System', 'Keycard acquired. You have been registered as Team<br/>Arkride Solutions.')
('Van', 'Wait, what?')
('Feri', "How'd they know we were the ones who picked it up?")
('Aaron', "The hell? I don't see any cameras around.<br/>They hidden or something?")
('Quatre', "I don't think so. I'm thinking this is just part of the<br/>Genesis' surveillance system.")
('Risette', "I am of the same mind. In this case, I believe it's<br/>confirming that we obtained our keycard.")
('Bergard', 'A plausible hypothesis.')
('Agnès', "We already know that system is designed to be the<br/>keeper of the rules, but I didn't realize it could<br/>monitor us so closely.")
('Van', 'Yeah. With that thing following our every move, the<br/>bomb could go off the second a rule is broken.')
('Quatre', '...')
('Judith', "Hey, don't get all doom and gloom on me, you guys.<br/>As long as we play by the book, we'll be fine.")
('Judith', "Though I bet we can find a few loopholes here and<br/>there, too. Don't forget, our boss man's a<br/>loophole-finding master.")
('Quatre', 'Good point.')
('Van', "Hey, that feels more like a diss than a compliment...<br/>Still, you're not wrong. And I'm idea-generatin' as<br/>we speak.")
('Van', "Can't rack my brain over it too much, though. If we<br/>sit on our asses, we'll be havin' a date with the<br/>Goddess tonight.")
('Van', "I'll come up with something, though. We'll find a way<br/>to outwit 'em.")
('Quatre', "Yeah. I'm sure we will.")
('Quatre', "Either way, we've got the card now, but we can't use<br/>it just yet.")
('Quatre', 'We may as well head back above ground for now.')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Hey there, guys.')
('Fie', 'Nice to see you all again.')
('Agnès', 'We apologize for imposing on you like this.')
('Elaine', 'Oh, not at all. Renne already informed us that you<br/>would be coming.')
('Elaine', 'The game will begin soon, so we may need to keep<br/>this brief. What is it you wanted to discuss?')
('Van', "Actually, we wanted to propose somethin'.")
('Van', 'You guys wanna form an alliance for this thing?')
('Elaine', "Oh. Now there's an interesting idea.")
('Fie', "I guess there's no rule that says you can't. You guys<br/>sure are pros at thinking outside the box.")
('Fie', "Well, it's tempting—we ARE kinda short on numbers.")
('Agnès', "Oh, and please don't misunderstand. We aren't trying<br/>to capitalize on that fact...")
('Agnès', '...but we have our reasons for wanting to make it to<br/>the end. We need to be the last team standing.')
('Agnès', 'So, how about it? Will you help us?')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Hmm...')
('Fie', "I think it's pretty clear that our interests are aligned.")
('Fie', "And if we teamed up, I'm sure we'd be a force to be<br/>reckoned with. There's one problem, though.")
('Elaine', 'And that problem is...we disagree on a few key<br/>fundamental issues.')
('Elaine', 'For good or for ill, we must follow the bracer code to<br/>the letter.')
('Elaine', 'So if we join forces, you will have to adhere to it<br/>as well. No compromises.')
('Van', 'No surprises there.')
('Van', "But we desperately need your—no, all of your help—<br/>if we're gonna win this.")
('Van', "We've already had a lotta run-ins with Almata—more<br/>than I'd like to admit, actually...")
('Van', "...but that also means we know some juicy details<br/>about 'em. Want me to spill the beans?")
('Van', "Then all you gotta do is join up with us. Sounds like a<br/>pretty sweet deal, doesn't it?")
('Aaron', "(Gotta hand it to him. The guy knows how to sell an<br/>idea—and he's relentless, too.)")
('Risette', '(Unfortunately, they are a tough customer.)')
('Fie', '...')
('Elaine', "Well, you aren't wrong. We don't have a particularly<br/>good reason to turn down your offer...")
('Elaine', '...save for one: you are keeping secrets from us.<br/>Trust is the foundation of effective teamwork—and<br/>you clearly do not trust us.')
('Elaine', "To quote one of your favorite phrases, 'Your request<br/>just ain't up to our standards.'")
('Agnès', '(Negotiations are breaking down fast. Should we...?)')
('Van', '(No. The Geneses are a secret we should keep close<br/>to the chest.)')
('Van', "(The guild has close ties to the foundation.<br/>That's why even Renne hasn't brought it up to them.)")
('Zin the Immovable', "Well, I'm sure you have your reasons for keeping us in<br/>the dark, so I'm not gonna press you too hard on it.")
('Zin the Immovable', "But if we're gonna make this work, there's one<br/>concession you'll have to make.")
('Zin the Immovable', "You can't bring those two civilians into the game.")
('Agnès', '...')
('Quatre', 'A-Ah, right. The code.')
('Zin the Immovable', "We'll turn a blind eye to the trainee warrior, the guy<br/>with Heiyue connections, and the Marduk concierge.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'As for that actress... Actually, maybe some stones are<br/>better left unturned.')
('Zin the Immovable', "If you insist on taking those two students, though, the<br/>deal's off.")
('Zin the Immovable', "We're about to throw ourselves into the fire—and I'm<br/>not about to drag them into it with us.")
('Aaron', "You've gotta be kidding me.")
('Feri', "That's dumb! We're not going to leave<br/>anyone behind! Right, Van?")
('Van', "I'd rather not, but I'm not gonna force my opinion<br/>down their throats. It ain't my job to convince them.")
('Quatre', 'I have a personal stake in this matter. The nuclear<br/>weapon has more to do with me than anyone else.')
('Quatre', "I am not about to let it be abused. So I won't stand<br/>aside—because I know I have the strength to do<br/>something about it.")
('Agnès', 'I, too, have held my own during many crises with<br/>everyone here.')
('Agnès', 'I am capable of making an objective self-assessment<br/>of my strengths and weaknesses—and what I can and<br/>cannot do. I know I can do this.')
('Agnès', "While I can't share all the details now, I have a strong<br/>connection to the truth of what's happening here.")
('Elaine', '...')
('Fie', 'Huh.')
('Zin the Immovable', "All right. You've got the resolve, at least.")
('Zin the Immovable', "So now's the part where you put your fist where your<br/>mouth is.")
('Judith', "Really? We're fighting NOW? Of all times?!")
('Risette', 'I fear this is a necessary measure if we are to<br/>convince them.')
('Bergard', 'If this is a test of the mettle of our youth, then I will<br/>stay out of this.')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Ha. Many thanks, friend.')
('Elaine', 'Zin...')
('Fie', "We'll be rooting for you.")
('Van', "We're up against a future S-rank bracer. Don't drop<br/>your guard for a second!")
('Agnès', 'Right!')
('Quatre', 'FIO, XEROS! With me!')
('FIO', 'Understood! / RUFF!')
('Zin the Immovable', 'And I, Zin the Immovable, of the Taito school,<br/>will serve as your opponent.')
('Bergard', 'The match is decided.')
('Quatre', '*pant* Does that mean...')
('Agnès', 'We...did it...?')
('Zin the Immovable', "Well, I'll be. You got me. I might be getting a little<br/>too old for this stuff.")
('Van', "Says the guy who isn't even out of breath.")
('Aaron', "You're a freak of nature, you know that? I guess the<br/>Taito style is the real deal.")
('Risette', 'He stood as firm as a mountain in the wake of<br/>our attacks. No wonder he is called the Immovable.')
('Feri', 'So if we beat you, then does that mean...')
('Zin the Immovable', "Yeah. I'm fully convinced you've all got the will and<br/>the strength to see this through. Even you two.")
('Zin the Immovable', "I can't dismiss you as helpless civilians now. I won't<br/>object to you tagging along.")
('Agnès', 'Thank you, sir.')
('Quatre', 'Admittedly, I would not be able to keep pace without<br/>the aid of FIO and XEROS.')
('Fie', "Eh. I draw my strength from my gunswords, and you<br/>draw your strength from them. It's all relative.")
('Elaine', "I will give credit where it's due. You all have grown<br/>much stronger since we first met.")
('Elaine', "I'm still reluctant to accept your participation in this,<br/>but seeing as how my companions have come around<br/>to the idea, I will concede.")
('Agnès', '...')
('Zin the Immovable', "Guess that settles it. We'll happily work with<br/>you guys.")
('Zin the Immovable', "So long as our shared goal's to stop Almata—and<br/>ideally take 'em in alive—this doesn't violate the<br/>bracer code.")
('Zin the Immovable', "But we're still gonna follow the code to the letter.<br/>Can't waver on that point no matter what. Deal?")
('Van', "Yeah, it's a deal.")
('Van', "We'll be countin' on you guys.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Ha. Same here!')
('Fie', "...Why the long face? You're not happy about<br/>this arrangement? That's surprising.")
('Elaine', "On the contrary, I'm quite pleased. They will no<br/>doubt prove to be a valuable asset to us.")
('Elaine', '(Although, this does throw a wrench into my plans...<br/>Actually, maybe not.)')
('System', 'Zin, Elaine, and Fie will join you in the underground<br/>labyrinth expeditions.<br/>(They will not accompany you around town.)')
('Cao', 'Oho. Now, who do we have here?')
('Van', "Huh. Didn't realize you were gonna be here, Yin.")
('Rixia', 'We meet again—albeit in more dire circumstances<br/>this time.')
('Judith', "(...It's her.)")
('Aaron', "...? Well, color me surprised. Didn't think you had<br/>the balls to come down here yourself, Cao.")
('Aaron', "I thought you were the type to watch the chaos from<br/>afar while sipping tea and scheming shit.<br/>You're gonna get those feeble hands all dirty.")
('Risette', 'I am surprised to see so few among your rank.')
('Cao', "I left the rest of my men behind. They've been placed<br/>on alert, and I tasked them with serving as liaisons.")
('Cao', 'Not to mention, they would have certainly held<br/>Yin back.')
('Van', "Well, I'm not about to question your methods.<br/>You probably got an ace or ten up your<br/>sleeve, anyway.")
('Van', "We're pressed for time, so I'll cut to the chase—")
('Cao', 'I presume you are here to request our assistance?')
('Cao', 'I will take that reaction as a yes.')
('Cao', "I cannot think of any other reason why you would<br/>seek us out—not after taking the game's rules<br/>into account.")
('Feri', 'You spotted the loophole, too?')
('Bergard', 'Your mind is as sharp as they say. Your reputation<br/>precedes you, White Orchid Dragon.')
('Van', "Still, you're a little off the mark. We ain't here to<br/>grovel at your feet and beg for help—we wanna form<br/>an equal partnership.")
('Van', "We've already had a lotta run-ins with Almata—more<br/>than I'd like to admit, actually...")
('Van', "...but that also means we know some juicy details<br/>about 'em. Want me to spill the beans?")
('Van', "Then let's form an alliance. Not a bad deal, eh?")
('Cao', 'Hmm... Very interesting.')
('Rixia', '...')
('Agnès', "We aren't here to stand in your way.")
('Agnès', "We understand it simply isn't our place to interfere<br/>with the power balance in the criminal underworld.")
('Agnès', 'Still, I believe this will be a mutually beneficial<br/>arrangement for all of us.')
('Agnès', 'I implore you—lend us your strength so we may bring<br/>this monstrous game to an end.')
('Cao', 'Heh. I believe I understand your position now.<br/>Strength in numbers, as they say.')
('Cao', 'Even so, I am going to need further convincing<br/>before we decide to take you up on your offer.')
('Quatre', 'What more convincing do you need?')
('Cao', 'We must assess whether your aid will be a boon or a<br/>hindrance, so I believe a little combat test is in order.')
('Cao', 'Would you not agree, Yin?')
('Rixia', "I would. I don't consider myself a part of Heiyue, but<br/>I am well accustomed to fighting alongside them.")
('Rixia', 'Bringing you into the fold could disrupt<br/>that synergy...')
('Rixia', '...so I need reassurance that your strength will make<br/>up for that.')
('Feri', '...!')
('Aaron', "Well, if that's how it's gotta be, that's how it's<br/>gotta be.")
('Risette', 'So we will be facing the legendary xiongshou, then.')
('Bergard', 'Excellent. I could hardly think of a more<br/>worthy opponent.')
('Rixia', '...I am honored you of all people would say that.')
('Cao', 'Unfortunately, I must request that you serve<br/>as referee. It would not be a fair<br/>assessment, otherwise.')
('Cao', 'Yin and I shall serve as your opponents. The older<br/>gentleman aside, you may all participate in this bat—')
('Judith', "Nah. We don't need that many.")
('Cao', "Ah. It's a pleasure to finally make your acquaintance,<br/>Judith Lanster.")
('Cao', "I'm something of a fan, myself. Golden Blood is<br/>undisputedly my movie of the year.")
('Judith', 'Uh, thanks. Anyway...')
('Judith', "It's good to see you again. Been a while, hasn't it?")
('Rixia', "That it has. You've been doing quite well for yourself<br/>while I've been away.")
('Van', 'Wait, hold the phone. You two know each other?')
('Aaron', 'For real? You, like, friends or something?')
('Judith', "Yeah. Although, we're not just friends. We're rivals.")
('Judith', "And we've been that way since the day we met.")
('Judith', 'That was...eight years ago now? We had only just<br/>taken up the mantle from our predecessors at<br/>that point.')
('Judith', 'Sometimes our jobs put us in conflict with one<br/>another, but we got to team up every now and then.')
('Judith', 'We may have been rivals, but we were comrades, too.')
('Feri', '...')
('Agnès', "I never would've guessed.")
('Rixia', 'The memories are coming back to me. We spent<br/>many hours discussing the weight of what we<br/>had inherited.')
('Rixia', 'Before I knew it, though, you had found your place<br/>amongst the stars. You were thriving in a world<br/>unbeknownst to me.')
('Rixia', "Oh, but don't misunderstand. I was truly happy for<br/>you, but I was a little sad as well. I felt left behind.")
('Judith', 'So you left for Crossbell and followed that other<br/>path...because of me?!')
('Rixia', 'Not at all. The path I chose was entirely my own.')
('Rixia', "Having said that, it's possible I was subconsciously<br/>influenced by you on some level.")
('Rixia', "You're like the brightest star in the sky. I'm just a<br/>moon—I can't shine like you...or her.")
('Rixia', 'But I came to know the joy of the stage—as well as<br/>being at the center of it. The life of theater has<br/>captivated me ever since...')
('Rixia', '...just like how the life of cinema has done the same<br/>for you.')
('Judith', '...')
('Judith', "Y'know, I'm almost jealous. When I was struggling to<br/>find my way, you lent me an ear and your wisdom.")
('Judith', 'You never needed my help, though. You found the<br/>path you wanted to follow all on your own.')
('Cao', 'Well, well, well! I see my theory proved to be true.')
(40301, "You wanted a demonstration of my skills, correct?<br/>Perhaps we could make this a competition, then.<br/>For old time's sake.")
(40301, "I'm curious to see which of us has grown more these<br/>past four years.")
('Rixia', "As am I. Let's do this!")
('Quatre', "It's like we're watching the climax of a movie Judith's<br/>starring in.")
('Feri', 'The fires of their rivalry have been set ablaze!')
('Aaron', 'Heh.')
('Aaron', "I think I'll add my own fuel to the fire.")
('Aaron', "Cao! I've got a score to settle, and I'm not gonna be<br/>satisfied until I beat the ever-loving shit outta you.")
('Agnès', 'Are you serious, Aaron?!')
('Van', 'So you gonna take him up on his offer?')
('Cao', 'Heheh. Very well. I suppose I already had the<br/>pleasure of sparring with you recently, Van.')
('Cao', 'I hold your potential in high regard,<br/>Little Conqueror.')
('Cao', "Let's see if you managed to break out of your shell.<br/>Show me that my confidence in you is not misplaced!")
('Aaron', "I'll do more than that, you four-eyed<br/>bastard!")
('Bergard', 'Perhaps you should be the one to serve as referee<br/>this time.')
('Van', 'Sure thing.')
('Van', 'Ready... Begin!')
('Cao', 'Interesting. Very interesting.')
('Cao', 'The time you have spent under Van has clearly done<br/>wonders in drawing out your latent potential.')
('Aaron', "*pant* I've been seeing a hell of a lot of combat, that's<br/>for sure.")
('Aaron', "You barely broke a sweat through that whole<br/>thing, though. Looks like I've got a ways to go.")
('Cao', "Oh, I wouldn't say that. You may catch up to me<br/>sooner than you realize...")
('Cao', '...but I have no intention of letting you surpass me.<br/>Should you pursue that goal, you will quickly find<br/>yourself to be out of your depth.')
('Aaron', 'Tch.')
(40301, 'Whew... You sure are something.')
('Judith', "If I didn't have my little power boost, I doubt I<br/>would've beaten you.")
('Judith', "Was that really your best, though? If I didn't know<br/>any better, I'd think you were holding back on me.")
('Rixia', "Haha. I don't think that's true at all.")
('Rixia', "Anyway, I would say you passed our test with<br/>flying colors. It's clear to us that you're<br/>incredibly strong.")
('Rixia', "I hope my performance didn't leave you disappointed.")
('Judith', 'Oh, you have GOT to be kidding me.')
('Rixia', '...')
('Judith', "If I had to rate it on a scale of one to ten, I'd give you<br/>an eleven. You were that amazing.")
('Judith', 'Argh. I am SO jealous of that woman! She has you all<br/>to herself!')
('Judith', "And thanks to her, you've grown to be a shining star.<br/>She must be really special.")
('Rixia', "Haha. That's one quality the two of you share.<br/>You have more in common with her than you<br/>might realize.")
('Rixia', "Though there's someone else from Crossbell who<br/>changed my life. Someone who is also very special.")
('Judith', 'Wh-What? *gasp* Do you mean...you found your<br/>special someone?!')
('Rixia', "Ahaha. That isn't quite what I meant.")
('Rixia', "Oh, and speaking of good friends, I hear you've<br/>gotten quite close with another actress.")
('Judith', 'Ohh, no. I am NOT letting you weasel<br/>your way out of this one!')
('Agnès', 'That was certainly enlightening.')
('Quatre', "I never expected Judith would be so close with one of<br/>Arc en Ciel's best and brightest.")
('Risette', "Well, we shouldn't eavesdrop any more. It's rude to<br/>pry into someone else's personal life.")
('Feri', "True. Still, I'm glad this whole thing had a<br/>happy ending.")
('Van', "Now that that's settled, we good to seal the deal?")
('Cao', "Yes. Your team will have Heiyue's full support.")
('Cao', 'Should any fundamental disagreements arise, we shall<br/>settle them then and there.')
('Van', "Works for me.<br/>(I can't drop my guard around this guy for even<br/>a second. Better keep a very close eye on him.)")
('System', 'Cao and Yin will join you in the underground<br/>labyrinth expeditions.<br/>(They will not accompany you around town.)')
('Shizuna', "What's up, guys? Oh, and if it isn't the famous<br/>Roaring Lion himself. Nice to see you again.")
('Shizuna', "It's been, what, three-ish weeks since we met?<br/>And even less for the rest of the gang.")
('Van', "Didn't expect to find you here alo—wait, hang on.<br/>You met my master?")
('Bergard', "'Met' isn't the word I'd use. We merely exchanged<br/>glances from a distance.")
('Bergard', 'I regret that I was unable to greet you directly, Divine<br/>Blade of Silver.')
('Shizuna', 'Heh. Likewise.')
('Shizuna', 'All righty, then. On to business.')
('Shizuna', "You're here to propose an alliance, yeah?")
('Agnès', '...!')
('Van', 'Huh. You knew what we were gonna say before we<br/>even said it.')
('Van', "That Unclouded Eye of yours is freakishly accurate.<br/>Might even rival your master's one day.")
('Shizuna', "Heehee. Nah. Can't say it quite measures up to his<br/>Omniscient Eye.")
('Shizuna', "Anyway, if you want to propose your plan, now's a<br/>good time. The others are lying low on the surface, so<br/>I'm the only one here.")
('Van', "Nice. I'll get straight to the point, then. We're lookin'<br/>for a partner for this game.")
('Shizuna', "Sure. I'm in.")
('Van', "We've already had a lotta run-ins with Almata—wait,<br/>just like that?!")
('Aaron', 'This chick is nuts.')
('Quatre', 'I did not expect her to say yes so readily.')
('Van', "That saves the effort of explainin', at least.")
('Van', "I'm guessin' the reason you're here is 'cause of<br/>whatever's hidden away in Longlai.")
('Van', "I ain't got a clue as to who hired you guys, but isn't<br/>joining up with outsiders like us against their terms?")
('Shizuna', 'Nope. Our contract has no such prohibition.')
('Shizuna', "Besides, even if you did try to wrestle the truth out of<br/>us, you'd never succeed—not as you are now, anyway.")
('Feri', '...')
('Risette', 'She is neither lying nor exaggerating.')
('Agnès', "Whatever secret they're holding must be<br/>very important.")
('Van', "Well, we're not gonna force you to let the cat out of<br/>the bag... Not right now, anyway.")
('Van', "You sure you're down for this, though? I mean, we<br/>ain't about to look a gift horse in the mouth, but we<br/>thought you'd need more convincing.")
('Shizuna', "I've got no reason to turn you down. That nose of<br/>yours is highly dependable.")
('Shizuna', "With my Unclouded Eye and your super sniffer, we'll<br/>be unstoppable!")
('Shizuna', "Not to mention, your little lady friend's got a trick or<br/>two up her sleeve.")
('Agnès', '...')
('Van', '...')
('Aaron', "(Ugh. She's annoyingly perceptive.)")
('Quatre', "(She can read us like we're an open book.)")
('Feri', "(We should count ourselves lucky that she's willing to<br/>join us. She'll be a big help.)")
('Van', "Okay. It's a deal—")
('Kurogane', 'Not so fast.')
('Judith', 'Him again?')
('Risette', "It's that Ikaruga ninja.")
('Shizuna', "Hmm? What's wrong?")
('Kurogane', 'I must apologize in advance, Princess. I may be<br/>speaking out of turn.')
('Kurogane', 'However, I must remind you that a crucial aspect of<br/>our current mission is to spread our name throughout<br/>the criminal underworld.')
('Kurogane', 'If we were to form an alliance, we would be unable to<br/>take full credit for our accomplishments here.')
('Shizuna', 'Fair point.')
('Judith', 'Darn. And just when we came to an agreement, too...')
('Van', "Now I'm even more curious about what you're really<br/>tryin' to do here.")
('Bergard', 'Kurogane, was it? I understand you have your own<br/>reasons for intervening...')
('Bergard', '...but she already provided a verbal agreement to<br/>our proposal.')
('Bergard', "It is unbecoming of a subordinate to speak out against<br/>his master's wishes.")
('Kurogane', '...!')
('Shizuna', "Eh. It's no biggie. I'm used to his nagging.")
('Shizuna', "Besides, I probably should've run it past you to begin<br/>with, so if you're that opposed, we can call this off.")
('Kurogane', "No, no. The lion was correct—I well overstepped<br/>my bounds. You needn't go that far.")
('Kurogane', 'I will not oppose an alliance, but I will suggest we add<br/>one condition to its approval.')
('Kurogane', 'I will test their abilities—personally.')
('Kurogane', 'If you pass, the agreement shall stand, but if you fail,<br/>it will be null and void.')
('Agnès', "I see. So if we prove that we can compete on your<br/>level, then you'll allow it.")
('Quatre', "I suppose that's a fair condition...")
('Aaron', "Haha. You're picking a fight with the wrong<br/>crew, maskface. Bring it.")
('Kurogane', 'You need only defeat me to pass my test.')
('Kurogane', 'In return, I only ask that the Roaring Lion<br/>stand aside. His abilities were never in question.')
('Van', "Got'cha. Why don't you be the referee, then, Master?")
('Bergard', 'Very well.')
('Shizuna', "No fair. You're always hogging all the fun.")
('Shizuna', "Oh, well. Guess I'll just kick back and watch you all<br/>go at it.")
('Kurogane', 'I, Kurogane—intermediate-level shinobi and<br/>practitioner of the Rougetsu school—shall serve as<br/>your opponent.')
('Kurogane', 'If you wish to form an alliance with Ikaruga, then<br/>prove your worth.')
('Aaron', '...?!')
('Risette', "Those aren't mere shard-based illusions.")
('Feri', "How's he doing that?! They can't be real... Can they?!")
('Van', "Nah. That's probably some ninja technique.<br/>Doubt that's a skill you can pick up at the Black God<br/>One Blade school.")
('Van', "Two of 'em are definitely phonies, though. We just<br/>gotta pick out the real one and beat the shit out<br/>of him!")
('Kurogane', 'Now, let us begin!')
('Van', "Got'cha!")
('Kurogane', 'Gah!')
('Shizuna', 'And the victory goes to...Arkride Solutions!')
('Bergard', 'Well done. Both sides fought admirably.')
('Van', "Whew. Rougetsu's a real pain in the ass to<br/>fight against.")
('Shizuna', 'Even so, you managed to pin down the real Kurogane<br/>fairly quickly. You really are full of surprises.')
('Van', "Ehh, it ain't that impressive. I just employed a bit of<br/>martial arts trickery.")
('Van', 'Plus I got my trusty nose to guide my way.')
('Shizuna', 'Ah, yes.')
('Kurogane', 'Very impressive.')
('Risette', 'Mr. Arkride never fails to amaze.')
('Agnès', 'It took everything I had to even keep up.')
('Shizuna', 'Well, then. Looks like we have a deal.')
('Shizuna', "I'm sure we'll have some disagreements along the<br/>way, but we can deal with them as they come.")
('Van', 'Works for me.')
('Kurogane', 'I hope you can forgive me for my impudence.')
('Quatre', 'Whoa!')
('Judith', "Ack! D-Don't scare us like that! Give us a warning<br/>next time, at least!")
('Kurogane', 'You ask the impossible. I am a shinobi who lives in<br/>the shadows. You will simply have to adjust to me...')
('Kurogane', '...and my dear twin brothers.')
('Feri', 'What?! I thought they were clones!')
('Aaron', "You're saying they were real-ass people?!")
('Kurogane', 'No. That was but a mere lighthearted jest.')
('Shizuna', "Haha. Don't worry, guys. You'll get used to him and<br/>his sense of humor soon enough.")
('Van', 'Like hell, we will!')
('System', 'Shizuna and Kurogane will join you in the<br/>underground labyrinth expeditions.<br/>(They will not accompany you around town.)')
('Harwood', 'Well, well. Looks like we have company.')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'Oh, my. Our dear little problem solvers have come to<br/>say hello, it seems.')
('Walter the Direwolf', 'The hell are you doing here? This is our turf.')
('Van', "Like the woman said, we're just droppin' by to say hi<br/>to our clients before the game starts.")
('Van', 'We asked Renne to give us your location.')
('Walter the Direwolf', 'That little snitch.')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', '*sigh* Our dear Renne used to be such a<br/>sweet kitten...')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', '...but then she ran away from home. Why did my<br/>little baby do this to me?')
('Walter the Direwolf', "Probably 'cause your way of doting on your cats is...<br/>uh...extreme. That's what drove Kreuger away, too.")
('Harwood', 'You need to learn to give them some space. No one<br/>wants to be suffocated by you.')
('Harwood', '...Actually, some men might be into that.')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'Then I need only find the right person. Perhaps one<br/>of these fine young men would like to accept my<br/>warm, tender embrace.')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'Or maybe the cute little kitty would be interested?<br/>I will gladly scoop her up and smother her with ALL<br/>of my affection. ❤')
('Feri', "I-I'll pass, thanks.")
('Aaron', "You're actually pretty close to my type, but the scale<br/>dust is a turn off. I don't want that shit all over me.")
('Quatre', "R-Really? That's the part that puts you off?")
('Harwood', "Anyway, I'm all for forming a pact and collaborating<br/>with you kids...")
('Harwood', "...but you'll live to regret that decision till the day<br/>you die.")
('Van', '...')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', '...Oh?')
('Walter the Direwolf', "You can't be serious. That's what you're here for?")
('Walter the Direwolf', "You don't wanna do that. Take it from me—there<br/>isn't a bigger monster in all of Zemuria than this guy.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "I'm inclined to agree. This man's very existence is<br/>pure poison.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "He's the last person you'd want to form an<br/>alliance with.")
('Harwood', "Now that's a little harsh, don't you think?")
('Van', "I'll say it again. Our contract was just an excuse to<br/>come here.")
('Van', "I don't believe in workin' pro bono.")
('Van', "We've got another client now, and we could just as<br/>easily team up with them.")
('Agnès', 'Van...')
('Harwood', 'Figured as much. So why are you here, then?')
('Van', "'Cause this piece of shit 'game' changed everything.")
('Van', "Don't get me wrong. We don't NEED your help to<br/>win this thing. We've got other tools at our disposal.")
('Van', "An alliance would just be one of those 'nice to haves.'<br/>Just one more card in our deck.")
('Van', "And we're well aware you're the wildest of wild cards.")
('Van', "But we're up against the most monstrous, insane<br/>scum around, so I figure fightin' fire with fire ain't a<br/>bad play.")
('Aaron', '...')
('Quatre', "You've really thought this through, huh?")
('Harwood', 'Heheheh. I like you, kid. I really do.')
('Harwood', "Well, you're up, Retzy.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'Sending me again, are you? Why am I not surprised?')
('Risette', "What's happening?")
('Agnès', 'Gold...butterflies?')
('Walter the Direwolf', "Come on, man. Why don't you do your own damn<br/>dirty work for once in your life?")
('Harwood', 'You know as well as I do that life is best enjoyed with<br/>a little spice.')
('Harwood', "So I'm spicing things up by letting one of the society's<br/>most vicious vipers sink her fangs into these kids.")
('Harwood', "If you don't succumb to the poison and somehow<br/>come out on top, we'll join your little crew.<br/>Sound good?")
('Feri', '...?!')
('Judith', "A golden lance? No, it's more like...a really long<br/>butter knife?")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "Heehee. Isn't it lovely?")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "It's known as the Dusk Glaive. None other than<br/>the Grandmaster gave it to me as a present.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "Do make this fun for me, won't you? I would hate for<br/>you to die too quickly.")
('Van', 'Get back!')
('Bergard', 'On your guard, everyone!')
('Walter the Direwolf', 'How about you and I go at it?')
('Walter the Direwolf', "Your Stigma might be gone, but your martial arts<br/>prowess rivals my old master's at his prime.")
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Show me what you can do, old man.')
('Bergard', 'If you insist. I am only as strong as I am today due to<br/>my training with Ryuga. I do not wish to disappoint<br/>one of his students.')
('Agnès', 'Bergard!')
('Van', 'Master can handle himself. Stay focused on her!')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'Heehee. Let the sparks fly!')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'Oh, my.')
('Van', '*pant* You are one tough lady.')
('Risette', 'We vastly outnumbered her, yet victory nearly slipped<br/>through our grasp.')
('Aaron', 'Yeah, I am NOT getting in bed with that she-devil.')
('Bergard', "I see you are no worse for wear. I'm relieved.")
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Heh. Not bad.')
('Harwood', 'Impressive. I had expected you to pull through...')
('Harwood', "...but I thought it'd be at the expense of a few limbs.")
('Agnès', '...')
('Judith', "This guy's a real piece of work.")
('Van', "Now, it's time for you to hold up your end of the<br/>bargain—and you better not pull a fast one on us.")
('Harwood', "Heheh. Worry not. I am many things, but a liar isn't<br/>one of them. You have yourself a deal.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'Honestly, I was already more than happy to lend<br/>them a hand—even before the test.')
('Walter the Direwolf', "This suits me just fine. I'd rather help you out than<br/>that sack of shit, anyway.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Countin' on you, chief.")
('Van', 'Whaaatever.')
('Feri', "I should be relieved, but somehow, I think I'm even<br/>more anxious than before.")
('Quatre', "The feeling is mutual, I assure you. We can't afford to<br/>let our guard down with these three in our party.")
('Harwood', "Oh, it'll only be these two joining you. I'm bailing.")
('Harwood', 'I only came here to see them off.')
('Aaron', '...What?')
('Van', "You're ditching us?")
('Harwood', "Yeah. I'm managing the operation from the sidelines.")
('Harwood', "You kids have way more energy than me, so I'll leave<br/>it to you. If you need me, I'll be chilling at a<br/>bar somewhere.")
('Harwood', "Oh, but don't forget our original request. Make sure<br/>you give this game a little extra dose of excitement.")
('Van', '...')
('Agnès', 'What an utterly loathsome man.')
('Feri', "Yeah. I dread to think what he's really after here.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Hey, don't go getting cold feet on us. You were the<br/>ones who were so desperate to work with us.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "I can't speak for that repulsive creature, but you can<br/>rest easy knowing we won't cut your throats in<br/>your sleep.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "Oh, here's a fun idea. You can hire us as<br/>temporary employees! Would you like for me to call<br/>you 'chief'?")
('Van', 'I think I would rather die.')
('System', 'Walter and Lucrezia will join you in the underground<br/>labyrinth expeditions.<br/>(They will not accompany you around town.)')
(500, '1:59PM')
('Van', '...')
('Agnès', "It's almost time.")
(500, '2:00PM')
('System', 'The upper zone is now accessible to Team<br/>Arkride Solutions.')
('Risette', 'It looks like the door has been activated.')
('Quatre', 'Now we just need to use our keycard.')
('Quatre', "It didn't say anything about our alliance... I won't<br/>lie—I was a little anxious about that.")
('Agnès', "I thought we'd be okay in the end, but I was<br/>nervous, too. Looks like it's treating us as one team.")
('Fie', "Yeah, we're part of Team Arkride Solutions now.<br/>Guess that's fine by me.")
('Cao', 'We appear to have been folded into Team<br/>Arkride Solutions.')
('Shizuna', "Heh. So they're treating us as part of Team Arkride<br/>Solutions now.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Looks like we've joined your crew for real. Better get<br/>used to us—'cause we aren't leaving.")
('Van', "Well, this is it, y'all. Let's get movin'.")
('Van', "We gotta get our hands on that keycard. Can't enter<br/>till we do.")
('Van', "We've got the keycard, but we can't open this thing<br/>until the scheduled start time.")
