('Feri', 'There they are!')
('Quatre', "That...doesn't look good.")
('Judith', 'We should prooobably keep our distance.')
('Lucio', 'Wh-What in the blue blazes?')
('Van', "Hey there. How's it goin'?")
('Lucio', "...Rather poorly, as you can plainly see. Why don't<br/>you cease with the pointless questions and help us?!")
('Van', "Will do. We are bein' paid to get you outta this jam,<br/>after all.")
('Van', "We're problem solvers, and we got a request to find<br/>you guys.")
('Damian', 'Th-Then hurry the hell up and do something<br/>about this!')
('Risette', 'Would you mind explaining the situation first?')
('Tebo', "Are you blind, woman?! We're being held against our<br/>will—so just get us out of here, already!")
('Roger', 'B-But how can they?!')
('Roger', "We've got these restraints, and if we force them off,<br/>they'll blow up!")
('Damian', 'Ngh!')
('Bergard', 'I recognize that machine.')
('Feri', 'It looks just like the one we saw earlier today.')
('Aaron', "And those look like Melchior's bombs.")
('Van', "All right, start talkin'. If you want us to save you, then<br/>you're gonna need to fill us in on all the details.")
('Lucio', 'V-Very well.')
('Lucio', "Over the last few days, some people we've never seen<br/>before started coming in and out of these<br/>underground areas.")
('Lucio', "And we weren't too hot on that.")
('Roger', 'We wanted to know what they were up to, so we<br/>snuck in here.')
('Damian', "And that's when we came face to face with that<br/>scrawny-lookin' psycho. Had some weird-ass<br/>mint hair.")
('Damian', 'He said something about wanting to drown us in our<br/>blood for trespassing—and then he attacked us!')
('Tebo', 'We tried to gang up on him, but he just knocked us<br/>all out with one swipe.')
('Tebo', 'When we came to, we were here.')
('Quatre', 'Well, I think the culprit is fairly obvious.')
('Feri', 'Yeah. This case has Melchior written all over it.')
('Judith', 'Hate to say it, but it...uh...kinda sounds like you<br/>brought this on yourselves.')
('Van', 'Yeah. This whole room reeks of dumbassery.')
('Lucio', 'Did you only come here to mock us?!')
('Lucio', 'I demand that you get rid of these blasted bombs,<br/>even if you have to throw yourselves on them to do it!')
('Lucio', "I'm sure my grandfather is paying you a fortune and a<br/>half to save me!")
('Lucio', "And I'll even add a little extra to sweeten the deal.")
('Lucio', 'I can easily pay double what you lowlife good-for-<br/>nothings will all make throughout your entire lives.')
('Lucio', 'A couple of bodies for a lifetime of comfort.<br/>That sounds like a pretty good trade to me.')
('Agnès', 'You have some nerve.')
('Feri', 'Is it wrong that I want to help him even less now?')
('Aaron', 'Nope. I was just thinking the same thing.')
('Van', "Yeah, we're out. Good luck gettin' outta this one on<br/>your own.")
('Lucio', 'Huh? What do you mean?')
('Van', "I mean, you said it yourself. We're just some lowlife<br/>good-for-nothings.")
('Van', "A bunch of dignified upper class gentlemen shouldn't<br/>be takin' help from the likes of us.")
('Van', "Should've realized you had this under control, so we'll<br/>just see ourselves out. Peace.")
('Lucio', 'H-Hey!')
('Roger', "Don't go!")
('Damian', "Say something, damn it! We can't get outta<br/>this ourselves!")
('Lucio', 'Wait! Please!')
('Lucio', "Are you seriously leaving me here to die?! I'm the<br/>grandson of the ETWS president!")
('Van', "That's no way to ask someone for help, my guy.")
('Van', 'Try again. This is your last chance.')
('Lucio', 'Guh...')
('Lucio', "I-I... I'm...sorry...")
('Lucio', 'Please! Save us!')
('Lucio', "I don't wanna die here!")
('Van', '...Good enough.')
('Lucio', 'Phew.')
('Roger', 'Thank goodness.')
('Tebo', 'For a second, I thought you were actually gonna bail<br/>on us.')
('Van', 'So do you know for sure that those things are bombs?')
('Lucio', 'Yeah. That lunatic set one off right in front of us.')
('Damian', 'Just thinking about that is giving me goosebumps all<br/>over again...')
('Agnès', 'Did he say anything about how to disarm them?')
('Feri', "I kinda doubt he'd tell them that.")
('Van', "Actually, I wouldn't put it past him. He does love his<br/>theatrics, after all.")
('Van', 'I could see him giving them a clue or two for us<br/>to decipher.')
('Lucio', "Y-Yes, that's exactly what he did.")
('Roger', 'We can disarm the bombs with a password.')
('Judith', 'So how do we figure that out?')
('Lucio', 'You have to solve an Oración quiz.')
('Van', 'A what now?')
('Lucio', "I said an Oración quiz! Don't make me repeat myself!")
('Damian', 'That rat bastard made us memorize the questions.<br/>He said the answers would help you find<br/>the password.')
('Aaron', "That guy loves screwing with us, doesn't he?")
('Van', 'Why am I not surprised?')
('Van', "So what're the questions? For your sake, I really hope<br/>you didn't forget 'em.")
('Roger', 'Of course not. There were four in total, so each of us<br/>committed one to memory!')
('Quatre', "Why did you have to do it that way? Couldn't you<br/>just remember them all?")
('Risette', "That is likely beyond their capabilities. We shouldn't<br/>expect so much of them.")
('Damian', 'Shut the hell up! Thanks to all your rambling, I went<br/>and forgot it!')
('Lucio', 'What the hell, Damian?!')
('Tebo', "If you forget your question, we're all doomed!")
('Damian', "W-Wait a sec. It's on the tip of my tongue...")
('Damian', "Ah! I remember now! The first question was, 'What<br/>is the height of the tallest cathedral in the city'?")
('Roger', '*sigh* You scared me half to death.')
('Roger', "The second question was, 'How many films are<br/>currently screening at the movie theater'?")
('Tebo', "The third question was...umm... 'How many years has<br/>it been since the opera house was renovated'?")
('Lucio', "And the last question was, 'What's the number on<br/>Oración's one and only red tram?'")
('Roger', "Oh, and he also mentioned the question order<br/>doesn't matter.")
('Van', "Got it. I've memorized 'em all.")
('Bergard', "I sincerely doubt we'll be able to guess the answers,<br/>but we should be able to figure them out without too<br/>much trouble.")
('Judith', "Yeah. Those questions don't sound too tough.")
('Van', 'You guys happen to know any of the answers?')
('Van', "Surely they teach some of this in school 'round here.")
('Lucio', 'Do you seriously expect us to remember such<br/>trivial numbers?')
('Lucio', 'The only numbers that matter are the ones on<br/>our speedometers!')
('Aaron', "Should've known these dumbasses would<br/>know nothing.")
('Agnès', "We'll just have to go find them ourselves, then.")
('Van', "Just sit tight until we come back. And don't move a<br/>muscle—unless you wanna be blown to<br/>kingdom come.")
('Lucio', 'Y-You will come back, right?')
('Van', 'What kinda heartless monsters do you take us for?')
('Van', "That said, there's a sliver of a chance we'll forget<br/>about you guys.")
('Van', 'If that happens, then...uhh...my bad.')
('Lucio', "Please don't forget us!")
('Risette', "Shall we search the movie theater first? It's close by.")
('Van', "The order doesn't really matter, but yeah, might<br/>as well.")
('Van', "We'll have to head to the other two districts for the<br/>cathedral and opera house questions.")
('Van', "We'll save the red tram for last. It's rare as hell, so we<br/>may have a wild goose chase in our near future.")
('Agnès', "Now that you mention it, I don't think I've ever<br/>seen it.")
('Feri', 'Me, neither.')
('Van', "We'll worry about it later. Let's go to the other three<br/>spots first.")
('Lucio', "Y-You're finally back...")
('Roger', 'What a relief...')
('Tebo', 'I really thought you left us for dead.')
('Damian', 'I never stopped believing!')
('Van', 'Sorry for taking so long.')
('Lucio', "Well, don't keep us in suspense. Did you figure out<br/>the answers?")
('Agnès', 'Yes. We have all four.')
('Aaron', 'Where do we put in the password?')
('Quatre', 'Probably in that device over there.')
('Quatre', "I'll handle that—")
('Van', 'Wait a sec.')
('Van', "We know the bombs will go off if we forcibly disarm<br/>'em, but are there other trigger conditions?")
('Lucio', "Y-Yeah. They're set to explode at midnight or if you<br/>input the wrong password.")
('Van', "I'll handle this, then.")
('Quatre', "No, it's too dangerous!")
('Agnès', 'There has to be some other way to do this.')
('FIO', 'FIO will input the password.')
('Feri', "But then you'll be in danger!")
('FIO', 'Fear not. I will be fine.')
('Quatre', 'Right... We just have to get the password right the<br/>first time.')
('Quatre', "Sorry about this, FIO. We're counting on you.")
('FIO', 'Roger.')
('FIO', 'The device requires a four-digit password.')
('Quatre', 'Four digits?!')
('Aaron', 'The hell? I thought we just needed to plug in all the<br/>numbers we got.')
('Bergard', "Seems it won't be that simple.")
('Van', 'Hey, you guys. You remember if the minty maniac<br/>said anything else?')
('Lucio', "I'm not sure. I feel like he might have...")
('Damian', "Can't say I remember.")
('Roger', "Wait, hold on! Didn't he say something about the<br/>numbers needing to be in the same place?")
('Tebo', 'Oh, yeah! That totally slipped my mind.')
('Judith', 'Is that supposed to be some kind of hint?')
('Quatre', 'Maybe it has something to do with the arrangement<br/>of the numbers?')
('Risette', 'Perhaps the solution will come to us if we review<br/>the answers.')
('Risette', 'The grand cathedral is 184-arge tall.')
('Risette', 'There are eight films being shown at the theater.')
('Risette', 'It has been ninety-two years since the opera house<br/>was renovated.')
('Risette', "And the red tram's number is 3451.")
('Van', 'Hmm... I think the password is...')
('Van', '...3198.')
('Feri', "How'd you get that?")
('Van', "I'm workin' under the assumption that the password<br/>pulls one number from each of the four answers.")
('Van', 'The tricky part is figuring out which numbers to pick<br/>and what order they go in.')
('Judith', 'But what did he mean by the numbers needing to be<br/>in the same place?')
('Judith', 'Does he mean the password is the first digit of<br/>each answer?')
('Van', "Don't think so. We'd have no idea what order to put<br/>them in.")
('Quatre', "Right. If he said the question order mattered, that'd<br/>be a different story.")
('Van', 'I think he wants us to take a number from the quiz<br/>answers and put them in the same digit space.')
('Van', 'If the password borrows a single number from each<br/>answer, then this is the only combination that works.')
('Risette', 'Oh, I see now. Take the three from 3451, the one<br/>from 184, the nine from ninety-two, and the eight...')
('Aaron', '...and you got 3198.')
('Agnès', 'Ah, that makes sense.')
('Quatre', "It's the only logical answer in this scenario.")
('Quatre', 'All right, FIO. Input the password.')
('FIO', 'Understood. Inputting 3198.')
('Van', "Let's pull out our shards, you guys. Just in case.")
('Damian', 'Wh-What the hell?!')
('Lucio', 'What about us?')
('Risette', 'Unfortunately, if we get too close, the bombs may<br/>detonate automatically.')
('Tebo', 'No way...')
('FIO', 'Input complete.')
('Melchior', 'Ding, ding, ding! Correctamundo!')
('Agnès', 'I know that voice from anywhere!')
('Feri', 'Melchior!')
('Melchior', "This is a recorded message from your friendly<br/>neighborhood Melchior! Don't bother responding to<br/>anything I say because, well, there'd be no point.")
('Melchior', 'Anywho, well done!')
('Melchior', 'You answered the password correctly, so our resident<br/>idiots will live to trespass another day.')
('Melchior', "Whoever you may be—whether you're the guild,<br/>fixers, or another party—I want to offer you my<br/>sincerest congratulations.")
('Melchior', 'You narrowly escaped a most gruesome death at<br/>my hands! Give yourselves a round of applause!')
('Aaron', 'So help me Goddess, I will choke the living HELL<br/>out of that annoying little prick.')
('Melchior', "Oh, and by the way, I wouldn't have actually killed<br/>you if you got the password wrong.")
('Melchior', 'After all, the bombs are all fakes! Fooled you!<br/>HAHAHAHAHA!')
('Lucio', 'Wh-What the...?!')
('Damian', "That piece of SHIT! I'm gonna kill that bastard!")
('FIO', 'Roger.')
('Van', "Let's pull out our shards, you guys. Just in case.")
('Damian', 'Wh-What the hell?!')
('Lucio', 'What about us?')
('Risette', 'Unfortunately, if we get too close, the bombs may<br/>detonate automatically.')
('Tebo', 'No way...')
('FIO', 'Input complete.')
('Melchior', 'BZZZT! Wrongamundo.')
('Aaron', "I know that voice from anywhere. It's Melchior!")
('Quatre', 'Oh, no. We got it wrong...')
('Melchior', "Unfortunately, it's game over for you. But at least<br/>you're going out...WITH A BANG!")
('Melchior', "...Got'cha! ♪")
('Van', '...What?')
('Melchior', 'Surprise! The bombs are all fake! Fooled you!')
('Melchior', 'HAHAHAHAHA! Oh, I wish I was there to see the<br/>looks on your faces!')
('Aaron', 'That freaking asshole played us!')
('Melchior', "By the way, this is only a recorded message, so if<br/>you're yelling at me—and I'm sure you are—you're<br/>quite literally wasting your breath!")
('Damian', 'Grr... I wanna mess that guy up!')
('Melchior', "Hopefully this experience has taught you a valuable<br/>lesson: never trespass on other people's gardens.")
('Melchior', "Oh, but if you're feeling a little daring, then by<br/>all means! Just know that next time, I won't show you<br/>any mercy! ❤")
('Roger', 'Eeek!')
('Melchior', 'See you later!')
('Lucio', "I am SO done with this! I'm never coming back to<br/>this place!")
('Tebo', "I can't believe the bombs were fakes this whole time.")
('Lucio', "Hmph. I should've known that no one was crazy<br/>enough to murder us with bombs—especially over<br/>such a minor offense.")
('Roger', '...Did you learn nothing from this?')
('Agnès', "*sigh* Let's just get you back to the surface. There are<br/>still monsters roaming around.")
