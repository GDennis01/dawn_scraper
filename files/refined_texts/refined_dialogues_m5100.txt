('Agnès', 'A woman who is secretly staying in Longlai and is<br/>desperate to keep her presence on the down low...')
('Agnès', "It's Judith, isn't it?")
('Risette', 'So our mysterious woman is staying here in secret and<br/>concealing her identity.')
('Quatre', "Yet our client recognized her despite them<br/>being unacquainted. I'm going to guess it's<br/>Judith Lanster.")
('Van', 'Yeah, probs.')
('Van', "Based on what the kid was sayin', I can't think of any<br/>other possibility.")
('Aaron', "So the Queen of Haughtiness is embarking on some<br/>'soul-searching journey'? Ha! That's RICH!")
('Aaron', "Ooh! This is my chance to scare the piss outta her.<br/>I'm gonna jump Her Highness when she least<br/>expects it!")
('Feri', "Please don't.")
('Feri', "Anyway, didn't that kid say there's a tree blocking<br/>the road?")
('Risette', 'Yes, but I doubt it would pose an obstacle for her.<br/>She is more than capable of getting past it herself.')
('Risette', 'We should check on her just to be certain, though.')
('Agnès', "Yes, but I doubt that'd stop her. She'll definitely be<br/>able to get past it herself.")
('Agnès', "But we won't know for sure until we check it out<br/>for ourselves.")
('Quatre', 'Umm... So just what kind of person is she?')
('FIO', 'Initiating investigation mode.')
('XEROS', 'RUFF!')
('Quatre', "Well, there's the tree—or at least what remains of it.")
('Quatre', 'It lines up with the location we were given.')
('Agnès', "Umm... Is this the tree we're looking for?")
('Risette', 'I believe so. It matches the location we were given.')
('Feri', "Well, those are claw marks, but I don't think they<br/>came from a monster.")
('Aaron', "Nah, that lady is one HELL of a monster.<br/>She could've hopped over it, but instead, she razed<br/>that shit to the ground with her bare hands.")
('Van', "I think she used a whip, too, but that's beside<br/>the point. She probably just needed to unload<br/>some stress.")
('Agnès', "Well, at least we now know she's gone down to<br/>the waterfall. Progress!")
('Agnès', "Anyway, let's go find her. The sooner we ease our<br/>client's worries, the better.")
('Risette', "Indeed. Let's head that way now. The sooner we find<br/>her, the sooner we ease our client's worries.")
('Risette', 'Very likely. In any event, I think we can safely<br/>conclude she has made her way to the waterfall.')
('Risette', "Now, then. Shall we head after her? The sooner we<br/>find her, the sooner we ease our client's worries.")
('Quatre', 'S-Seriously, though. What kind of person is she?!')
('Feri', 'Wow.')
('Agnès', 'So this is the famed Longlai Pubu.')
('Quatre', "This place is more beautiful than I could've imagined.")
('Risette', 'Truly the epitome of scenic beauty.')
('Van', '(This takes me back... He worked me to death here.)')
('Aaron', 'Not bad. Not bad at all.')
('Feri', 'Ah...')
('Van', "Are you for freakin' real?")
(40301, "Brr... S-So cold. I'm gonna freeze to death...")
(40301, "No, NO! Snap out of it, Judith! You aren't allowed to<br/>die out here!")
(40301, "I will not take Mom and Granny's sighs of<br/>disappointment any longer! Brrrrr...")
(40301, 'Grr... Clear your mind... Endure the<br/>f-f-freezing w-water...')
('Aaron', 'Hahahahahahaha!')
('Agnès', 'J-Judith...')
('Quatre', 'H-Huh? What on earth is she doing?!')
('Risette', 'She is performing a ritual known as<br/>waterfall meditation.')
('Van', "I think it's called waterfall meditation or somethin'.")
('Van', "And she even brought ritual clothes. She's really goin'<br/>all out with this crap.")
('Feri', 'Well, that definitely is Judith. No mistaking it.')
('Agnès', "At this rate, she's going to catch a dreadful cold.<br/>Perhaps we should go talk—")
('Agnès', 'Huh?')
('Van', 'Uh-oh.')
('Feri', "She's going to catch a cold soon, though. Maybe we<br/>should go talk—")
('Feri', 'Everyone, above us!')
('Aaron', "The hell's that?!")
('Risette', "It's a monster—and it is no ordinary one, either!")
('Quatre', "It's a monster—and it's no ordinary one, either!")
('Agnès', "Oh, no. It's looking straight at Judith!")
('Quatre', "And it's looking straight at Judith!")
('Van', 'Shoot!')
('Quatre', 'No!')
('Risette', '(Even if I accelerate, I will not make it in time!)')
('Agnès', 'Judith!')
(40301, 'Wha...? A-AAAAAAH!')
('Van', 'Damn it!')
('Aaron', 'Well, shit. She gonna make it?')
('Judith', 'Ngh... You picked the wrong day<br/>to mess with me!')
('Quatre', 'Wh-Whaaa...?!')
('Feri', 'Oh, thank Arusha! She transformed in the nick<br/>of time!')
('Van', 'Whew. You nearly gave me a heart attack there.')
('Aaron', 'Who let this monkey out of its cage?')
('Risette', 'I believe that beast is a cryptid from the East.')
('Judith', "Well, what's it doing here? H-Hey, wait a second!")
('Judith', 'I should be asking you that question! Why are YOU<br/>people here?!')
('Agnès', 'The guide boy from the village asked us to find you.')
('Quatre', 'Aha. You must be that phantom thief who prowls the<br/>capital and—')
('Quatre', "Wait. Now's hardly the time for idle chatter.")
('Van', "Looks like you're holding up okay. You ready to put<br/>that thing through a crash course in pain?")
('Judith', 'Oooh, yes. And the only thing on my agenda for<br/>today...is kicking your ass, you stupid primate!')
('Judith', "Your act of utter foolishness will be met with<br/>divine retribution. So get ready—because it's curtains<br/>for you!")
('Judith', '*pant*...*pant*... Ha! Serves you right, foul beast!')
('Van', "That definitely wasn't your run-of-the-mill monster.<br/>Must've been a cryptid.")
('Van', 'I never saw any of those back when I trained here.')
('Judith', 'Oh, really? Wait. You trained here, too?')
('Van', 'Yeah. About five years back.')
('Judith', "Huh. Go figure. That has to be a<br/>coincidence, though. There's no way it could be a<br/>twist of fate—")
('Judith', "That's not important! What are you all doing here?<br/>Explain yourselves!")
('Quatre', "She really does blurt out every passing thought,<br/>doesn't she?")
('Feri', 'Yep. We think she was born without a filter.')
('Agnès', "We're here because we decided to go on a hot<br/>springs trip.")
('Agnès', 'And, like I said earlier, the guide boy asked us to<br/>come look for you.')
('Risette', 'And a young guide from Longlai requested that we<br/>search for you.')
('Risette', 'We came here on a company trip so we could soak in<br/>the hot springs.')
('Risette', 'And a young guide from Longlai requested that we<br/>search for you.')
('Judith', 'Oh, that boy? Did I really worry him that much...?')
('Judith', '...Crap. A-Ahem! I believe you have the<br/>wrong person.')
('Judith', 'I am the phantom thief of justice—Grimcat. I am the<br/>deliverer of divine punishment to the dregs of society.')
('Judith', 'And I am most certainly NOT a celebrity actress who<br/>secretly slipped into Longlai! Perish the thought!')
('Quatre', "...With every word, you're digging yourself into a<br/>deeper hole.")
('Aaron', "This has to be a bit. You can't seriously be this dumb.")
('Feri', 'I think you messed this one up big time.')
('Judith', "I-I did no such thing! Are you insinuating that I'm a<br/>lia—aah!")
('Judith', 'Ah...')
('Van', "You're pushin' yourself too damn hard. You gotta be<br/>spent after all that meditating.")
('Van', "Take it easy. You're a bona fide hottie, so don't work<br/>yourself to the bone.")
('Judith', "A bona fide...hottie? I told you, I'm the mysterious<br/>phantom thief—")
(40301, 'Urgh...')
('Quatre', "Ah, she's back to normal.")
('Agnès', 'Judith...')
('Risette', 'She must have hit her limit.')
('Van', "All righty, then. Let's get you some warmer clothes.<br/>You're gonna catch a cold otherw—")
('Van', '...')
(40302, "Hmm? What's the matter?<br/>...")
('Aaron', "LET'S GOOOOOO! / AAAAAAH!")
('Aaron', "LET'S GOOOOOO!")
('Agnès', 'Aaron, Quatre! Have the decency to look away!')
('Agnès', "Aaron! Don't look at her!")
(40302, 'Ngh!')
('Aaron', 'Tch. Already stored the goods away.')
('Aaron', 'But Van already got an exclusive sneak peek.<br/>Lucky bastard.')
('Quatre', 'Ph-Phew. I was able to look away just in time.<br/>Van, however...')
('Feri', 'H-He saw it all...')
('Agnès', '...')
('Risette', 'I do not believe Van is to blame. It was simply an<br/>unfortunate mishap.')
('Van', "Yeah, that was a freak accident, but I can't say it<br/>wasn't a happy one for me as well.")
('Van', "You're free to slap me anytime. I'll throw in a<br/>discount on the request fee, too.")
(40301, 'Heheh. A special price? For me? Oh, how<br/>magnanimous of you, good sir...')
(40301, "...but I refuse. I'm not paying you a<br/>single mira, you cheapskate!")
('Judith', "I suppose I should at least thank you for taking the<br/>boy's request to check on me.")
('Judith', "I'll pay the request fee in full, but don't<br/>misunderstand. I'm doing this for the kid.<br/>Not you.")
('Van', 'Whatever floats your boat, lady. Thanks for<br/>your patronage.')
('Judith', 'Hmph. Farewell.')
('Feri', 'Wait a sec.')
('Agnès', 'Umm, Judith...')
('Van', "We wanna reassure you that your secret's safe with us.")
('Van', "You've seen my transformation, so we won't tell<br/>anyone about yours.")
('Judith', 'Oh. I appreciate that.')
('Agnès', 'Rest assured, we always uphold client confidentiality.')
('Agnès', 'Oh, and it might be a good idea to get in touch with<br/>Nina when you get a chance.')
('Risette', 'When you have a moment to spare, I would advise<br/>you to contact Ms. Fenly.')
('Risette', 'Client confidentiality is of the utmost importance to<br/>everyone at Arkride Solutions.')
('Risette', 'When you have a moment to spare, I would advise<br/>you to contact Ms. Fenly.')
('Judith', "You don't need to remind me. I know I made<br/>her worry.")
('Judith', "I'm grateful to all of you guys—minus that<br/>money-grubbing scoundrel and that<br/>red-haired asshole!")
('Quatre', "And just like that, she's gone.")
('Feri', 'Wow. Faster than a speeding bullet.')
('Aaron', "Man, she'd be a ten outta ten if it weren't for that<br/>personality of hers.")
('Aaron', 'Still jealous of you, though. I mean, you got to see an<br/>award-winning actress fully nude. Talk about winning<br/>the lotto and then some.')
('Agnès', 'Grr...')
('Quatre', 'Yes. Grr, indeed.')
('Van', "Gimme a break. That totally wasn't full-on nude.<br/>It was semi at most.")
('Van', 'The late-night showings at theaters are way more<br/>revealing, and—')
('Feri', "Huh? Wasn't she fully visible from the front, though?")
('Van', 'Urgh.')
('Feri', "In the Central East, it is strictly forbidden to look at a<br/>woman's bare skin unless you're her husband...")
('Feri', '...which means you might have to take it upon<br/>yourself to—')
('Van', 'Well, you know what they say, Feri: when in Calvard,<br/>do as the Calvardians do.')
('Feri', '*stare*')
('Van', "...Fine. I'll make sure to apologize to her later.")
('Agnès', 'Please do so.')
('Feri', "Yep! I think that's the best course of action.")
('Aaron', '(Damn. That little brat can be terrifying when she<br/>wants to be.)')
('Risette', 'Now, then. Shall we return to Longlai?')
('Agnès', "Yes. We shouldn't keep Yumé and Quatre waiting<br/>any longer.")
('Quatre', 'Yes. We best not keep Agnès and Yumé waiting.')
('Quatre', "Now that that's settled, we should make our way back<br/>to Longlai.")
('Agnès', "Good idea. We shouldn't keep Yumé and Risette<br/>waiting any longer.")
('System', 'Received')
('Van', "Don't sense any monsters around here. That's...weird.<br/>It's not like they're uniquely active during the day<br/>or anything.")
('Van', "If that novice took care of 'em all, he did one hell of<br/>a job.")
('Van', "Probably means the guy's out of gas by now, though.")
('Van', "I guess everyone's gotta blow off some steam every<br/>now and then...")
('Van', "...but if he keeps goin' full throttle, he'll find himself<br/>in the thick of trouble sooner or later. I should follow<br/>him just in case.")
('Van', 'Oho. Finally come out to play, have we?')
('Van', "Figured he'd miss a few.")
('Van', '...Okay, he missed more than a few. Great.')
('Van', "The odds are gettin' stacked against me, but I can<br/>turn the tables on these dung-for-brains with my<br/>shar—")
('Van', '...Never mind, I guess.')
('Bracer Kazan', 'Close call. You all right there? Wait, are you...?')
('Bracer Kazan', "Ah, you're a spriggan, yeah? I heard about you<br/>from Drusilla.")
('Van', "And you're Kazan from the Longlai branch, yeah?")
('Van', "You searchin' for that newbie, too? I'm thinking he's<br/>just up ahead.")
('Bracer Kazan', 'I had the same thought. Great minds think alike,<br/>I suppose.')
('Bracer Kazan', "Well, since we're doing the same job, why don't we<br/>join up? We could share some intel while we're at it.")
('Van', 'Sure. Two heads are better than one.')
('Van', "My help doesn't come free, though. So long as that's<br/>not a problem, then I'll gladly lend a hand.")
('Bracer Kazan', "Well, I suppose you can't make an omelet without<br/>breaking a few eggs.")
('Bracer Kazan', "In that case, I'll tell you everything I know.")
('System', 'Kazan explained that Gray was training at the<br/>Longlai branch to acquire his letter<br/>of recommendation.')
('System', 'He was serious, yet cordial. Everyone who came to<br/>the guild with requests held him in high regard.')
('System', 'However...')
('Bracer Kazan', 'I trained with him quite a bit, and every time we<br/>fought, his thirst for power was...abnormally palpable.')
('Bracer Kazan', "He's got some major tunnel vision when it comes<br/>to combat.")
('Bracer Kazan', "While that quality has helped him get stronger, it's<br/>never enough for him. He says he will stop at nothing<br/>to get more power.")
('Bracer Kazan', 'You met Gray in the capital, right? You happen to<br/>hear anything about his situation?')
('Van', "Nope. I've got nothing.")
('Van', "Doesn't seem like he's really opened up to the folks in<br/>the capital, either.")
('Bracer Kazan', "I guess we'll just have to ask him about what's going<br/>on when we find him.")
('Bracer Kazan', "All right. We're running short on time, so let's track<br/>him down quick.")
('Van', 'Easy as pie.')
('Bracer Kazan', "Hah. They didn't even stand a chance.")
('Bracer Kazan', '...It feels like there are more monsters around<br/>than before.')
('Bracer Kazan', "I'm sure I don't have to spell out what that means.")
('Van', "Nope. It's clear that Gray's not finishing them off,<br/>which means he's losing his grip on the situation.")
('Van', "We'd better hurry before the worst comes to pass.")
('Van', 'Wanna take the shortcut through the animal trail?')
('Bracer Kazan', 'No, we should hold off on that for now.')
('Bracer Kazan', "I'm sensing more creatures from beyond the thicket.")
('Bracer Kazan', 'I fear the monsters Gray failed to kill may have<br/>gathered together.')
('Bracer Kazan', 'They seem pretty on edge, too.')
('Van', "Hot damn. You've got some keen senses there.<br/>In that case, I'll yield to your intuition.")
('Van', 'Hey, mind if I ask you something?')
('Van', "You're from the East, ain'tcha? I'm thinkin' you must<br/>be from one of the northeastern tribes.")
('Bracer Kazan', "Wow. Nail on the head. I heard from Drusilla that<br/>you had a sharp nose, but I'm still surprised.")
('Bracer Kazan', "The fact that you know about the northeastern tribes<br/>is impressive, too. How'd you know I was from there?")
('Van', "'Cause the nose knows. Plus seein' those hunting<br/>skills of yours helped narrow things down.")
('Van', "I hear a decent amount about the East while<br/>doin' requests.")
('Van', 'And I know a little of how to differentiate Easterners<br/>from everyone else based on quirks of their regions<br/>and tribes.')
('Van', "Though I can't wrap my head around why someone<br/>like you would become a bracer in the Republic.")
('Bracer Kazan', "I don't have some grand reason to share, to be honest.<br/>I just got bored of being out in the middle<br/>of nowhere.")
('Bracer Kazan', "Figured I could make a name for myself in the<br/>Republic and enjoy what the capital has to offer.<br/>That's all.")
('Bracer Kazan', "I'm sure most of the people in my village have long<br/>since forgotten about me.")
('Van', "Eh, don't worry 'bout them. People are free to live<br/>however they want. You're no different.")
('Van', "Anyway, back to the matter at hand. I smell trouble...<br/>I think Gray's nearby.")
('Bracer Kazan', "Yes. He's over by the waterfall—and I sense a<br/>monster there as well.")
('Bracer Kazan', "Oh, and it's a big one. We should hurry.")
('Van', 'Roger that.')
('Bracer Gray', 'Ugh... Can barely move...')
('Bracer Gray', 'I-I have to get...stronger...for Sis!')
('Bracer Kazan', "Gray! Are you all right? Wow, you've hooked a big<br/>one this time.")
('Bracer Gray', "Kazan?! And you're...")
('Van', "We'll chat later. First things first: we gotta take care<br/>of this thing. You back down, rookie.")
('Bracer Gray', 'Ow. My leg...')
('Van', 'Change of plans!')
('Van', "Kazan, focus on protecting Gray. I'll fry this fishy<br/>bastard myself.")
('Bracer Kazan', 'Understood!')
('Van', 'Oh, damn. This big old fish looks pretty worn down.')
('Van', 'That newbie really did a number on this thing.')
('Van', "I'll just finish what he started, then.")
('Van', 'Gah.')
('Bracer Kazan', "Sorry. Didn't mean to steal the kill.")
('Van', "Wanted the spotlight for yourself, huh?<br/>Still, 'preciate the help.")
('Bracer Gray', 'Same. Thanks, you two...')
('Bracer Kazan', "Well, that's a wrap! ...Is what I'd like to say, but I<br/>know we need to settle the matter of your pay.")
('Van', 'You got it. We should go over that with Drusilla.')
('Bracer Kazan', "Then let's mosey on over to the guild. You okay with<br/>that, Gray?")
('Bracer Gray', 'Of course.')
