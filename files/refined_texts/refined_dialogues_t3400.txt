('Moritz', 'Hahaha! SUCCESS! That was a super-quick reaction<br/>there...way quicker than I expected.')

('Moritz', "'Controlled substance'? Pfft, no worries there!<br/>Can't be 'controlled' if it's not for human<br/>consumption in the first place!")
('Moritz', "I'm on to something with this, I swear—it's the<br/>perfect pick-me-up after my explosion tests. It was<br/>meant to be, I tell you! Hahahaha!")
('Moritz', "What's Professor Aurelie's problem? I ask to study<br/>under her, and she dismisses me like, 'You're just an<br/>arsonist in a lab coat!'")
('Moritz', "But what's so wrong about that?! It's ART!<br/>What's more beautiful than great balls of fire?!")
('Moritz', "That's what chemistry boils down to: it's the subtle art<br/>of making things go BOOM! Surely a fellow chemist<br/>would understand that! Bah...")
('Gimbat', "Phew... We finally have a plan. We're gonna ease the<br/>load on the servers and try to get them back online<br/>with a limited scope.")
('Gimbat', "It took less time than I was figuring, at least.<br/>They took out the Aurora, but Marduk's been<br/>handling some of the load for us.")
('Gimbat', "If we can make this plan work, we should have Basel's<br/>network back to full capacity soon.")
('Gimbat', "...I do wonder why Professor Cronkite isn't lending us<br/>a hand with it, though.")
('Gimbat', "This is his field—we really could've used his help.")
('Gimbat', "If we can manage the load on Basel's orbal network,<br/>we should be able to get it back online.")
('Gimbat', "Professor Cronkite would've had this all sorted out in<br/>seconds, though. He's one of the foremost authorities<br/>on network engineering.")
('Gimbat', "I just don't get why he's giving us the cold shoulder<br/>on this. I guess he has his reasons...?")
('Gimbat', "My heart sank when I heard Professor Callaghan<br/>went missing... I hope he's all right, wherever he is.")
('Gimbat', "Word is, he had a ton of computers in his lab running<br/>parallel processing. On what, I don't know.")
('Gimbat', "But that all got stolen, which means whatever<br/>research he was doing caught the<br/>criminals' attention...")
('Gimbat', "That does shed some light on what he'd been doing<br/>this whole time, for better and for worse...")
('Gimbat', 'Why did I come here to study? Well, part of it is that<br/>I got a reference from a school back in Elsaim...')
('Gimbat', "...but it's mainly that I want to give back to my home<br/>country using the knowledge and the gifts I have.")
('Gimbat', "Professor Hamilton's research has helped develop<br/>more than just Calvard—it's helped Elsaim, and tons<br/>of other nations, too.")
('Gimbat', 'I want to help bring Elsaim into this new age, just<br/>like she did for Calvard.')
('Gimbat', "I'm convinced that data science is the future.<br/>The more I study it, the more I realize how important<br/>it's going to be.")
('Gimbat', "Call it a pipe dream, but I think information systems<br/>will really help solve a lot of the world's problems.")
('Gimbat', "It's just a matter of getting the technology there.<br/>It's not here yet, but once it hits, it's gonna<br/>change everything.")
('Gimbat', 'I wrote about that in my Formula paper.<br/>Central Eastern problems, like water, traffic, and<br/>supply chains? Logistics could solve all of that.')
('Gimbat', 'One of my papers was published in the scientific<br/>journal Formula last month.')
('Gimbat', 'It was about a hypothetical social experiment where<br/>you gather big data from personal computers, and use<br/>data science to crunch the numbers.')
('Gimbat', "I'm honored that the scientific community received it<br/>so well—even Professor Cronkite gave it a<br/>thumbs up!")
('Gimbat', 'I still wanna explore that concept some more, though.')
('Gimbat', "I really want to use one of the giant orbal calculators<br/>they have in the labs here. I just can't, and that really<br/>grinds my gears...")
('Gimbat', "I want to put my paper to practice with some<br/>simulations, but consumer-grade computers just don't<br/>have the power for it.")
('Gimbat', "I tried making a super-optimized program for the<br/>number-crunching I need, but that still<br/>wasn't enough. I need something bigger.")
('Gimbat', "I really wish I could use the lab facilities here, but<br/>they don't open those up to freshmen. I have to wait<br/>for those...")
('Gimbat', "I'm just dying to get my hands on one of those huge<br/>orbal calculators already.")
('Lucas', "I was sitting in a lecture when everything went<br/>down yesterday. I'm still not over it...")
('Lucas', "The Artisanal District was attacked, too... I was really<br/>worried for my dad over there. He's all right,<br/>thank Goddess.")
('Lucas', "I've been worried for ages that it'll go under because<br/>of the changing times, but monsters destroying it<br/>would've been even worse.")
('Lucas', "...I think I'll go home early today.")
('Lucas', "I can't believe they attacked the institute... I hope it<br/>doesn't throw a wrench into my studies, but being<br/>realistic, it probably will.")
('Lucas', 'I want to... No, I HAVE to prove myself to my dad.<br/>I wanna hurry up and land some big project I can be<br/>proud of.')
('Lucas', "*sigh* Life's been really busy since I started at the<br/>institute—in a good way, though.")
('Lucas', "But I always hate going home because Dad's just<br/>gonna give me an earful about 'tradition.'")
('Lucas', "Does he just think I'm incapable of choosing my own<br/>career path? Is that it?")
('Lucas', 'If he really wants me to take up the workshop, then<br/>the workshop needs to get with the times.')
('Lucas', "Professor Cronkite's theses are like these windows<br/>into the future. It's crazy just how smart he is.")
('Lucas', 'His foresight really helps him get ahead of the curve<br/>and develop new technologies before people even<br/>realize they need them.')
('Lucas', "I doubt I'll ever be half the scholar he is, but I really<br/>want to learn what I can from him all the same.")
('Lucas', "Dad's factory is a relic of the past. It has nothing to<br/>do with me, and I have no reason to cling to it.")
('Lucas', "I wish Dad wasn't so darn stubborn. All I'm saying is<br/>that he should be more forward thinking...")
('Lucas', "...but nope. He's always trying to push the factory<br/>onto me, trying to tie me down to his old business.")
('Lucas', "Time marches on—if he doesn't get with the times,<br/>they'll leave him behind.")
('Liz', 'Professor Callaghan is... Is he really dead...?')
('Liz', 'He always seemed kinda scary, but the upperclassmen<br/>really respected him. I wanted to talk to him<br/>myself someday...')
('Liz', "I'm glad everybody else is okay, but...what do we even<br/>do now?")
('Liz', 'I thought it was weird how everybody was<br/>whispering today... Now it makes sense.')
('Liz', 'I had no idea about it—I overslept this morning.<br/>Last I heard was the gossip from last night.')
('Liz', "Professor Callaghan's kinda freaking me<br/>out nowadays. All the other professors say he's a really<br/>nice guy, though.")
('Liz', 'They talked about how he used to help mentor<br/>younger researchers at the institute. Are they really<br/>talking about the same guy, though?')
('Liz', "All I get from him are evil glares, like he's fed up with<br/>me already... Yeesh.")
('Liz', 'Ahh, seeing those wide-eyed Aramis students visiting<br/>brings back memories. I came to visit when I was<br/>younger, just like them.')
('Liz', "Crazy how young they look. I'm only two or three<br/>years older than them... I wonder if I looked that<br/>young when I visited, too?")
('Liz', "Their uniforms are really cute. Maybe that's what<br/>it is... W-Wait, am I ogling them?! No, bad thoughts!<br/>Bad thoughts!")
('Security Guard', "The institute's calmed down a bit. We should have<br/>this area secured now.")
('Security Guard', "But we can't let our guard down. We've dealt with<br/>one problem, but there could be another lurking<br/>around the corner.")
('Security Guard', 'We need to maintain our security detail here until<br/>this all blows over.')
('Security Guard', "I still can't believe that really happened yesterday...<br/>Even the police and the bracers were overwhelmed.")
('Security Guard', "I'm trying not to let it get to me, as a security officer...<br/>What's done is done. We have to help get things back<br/>under control now.")
('Security Guard', 'Man, I really screwed the pooch... Let an intruder<br/>blow right by me into the special research building.')
('Security Guard', "The investigation's still ongoing here, but I'll report<br/>whatever I find out here. Anything helps.")
('Security Guard', "I hear you're investigating this yourselves—and I see<br/>Mr. Salision is with you, too.")
('Security Guard', "I don't see the harm in letting you guys in. Go<br/>on through.")
('Security Guard', "I'm really worried about Professor Callaghan's<br/>disappearance... I think I speak for everyone here in<br/>saying I want to help bring him back.")
('Security Guard', "I hear you're helping with the investigation.<br/>Head on in.")
('Security Guard', 'Do you have business here at the institute? Most of<br/>the students and staff have gone home already.')
('Security Guard', "Our security system is on night mode, too, so you<br/>can't get in without special permission.")
('Security Guard', "Unless you already have clearance or your business is<br/>just that urgent, I'd suggest you come back in<br/>the morning.")
('Security Guard', 'This door here leads to the special research building.')
('Security Guard', "They do a lot of top-secret research in there, so it's<br/>closed to the general public.")
('Risette', '(Seems this building requires a higher security<br/>clearance than the rest of the city.)')
('Aaron', '(Top-secret, huh? Sounds like the perfect place to<br/>harass your coworkers and get away with it.)')
('Van', "(Wouldn't jump to conclusions, but yeah, it's worth<br/>lookin' into. Let's ask around and see what the people<br/>'round here know.)")
('Researcher Cindy', 'It was bad enough hearing that the professor<br/>was abducted... And then we got attacked, too...')
('Researcher Cindy', 'Why does this keep happening, just one horrible<br/>thing after another? I just wanna do my research and<br/>get my degree...')
('Researcher Cindy', "What do I even do now? I feel like I don't<br/>belong here...")
('Researcher Cindy', "It's been really painful for me these last few months.<br/>I was this close to dropping out of the<br/>institute altogether...")
('Researcher Cindy', "But everybody here's been so kind and supportive...<br/>My coworkers, too. I'm really happy they reached out<br/>to me.")
('Researcher Cindy', "I think maybe I should stick it out a little longer...<br/>Maybe it'll get better.")
('Researcher Cindy', "I hope Professor Callaghan is safe, too. I won't forget<br/>what happened in that lab, but...I just can't hate him.")
('Researcher Aster', 'Professor Callaghan was my whole world. All I<br/>wanted was to be special to him, and now...')
('Researcher Aster', "...No, I'm sorry. I shouldn't be trauma dumping on<br/>you like this. I just... I don't know anymore.")
('Researcher Aster', 'I hope that whatever monsters did this are brought<br/>to justice.')
('Researcher Aster', 'I thought the officers looking for him had been acting<br/>strangely this morning...')
('Researcher Aster', '...so I pressed them, and they ended up telling me.')
('Researcher Aster', "I just can't believe it... Why? How could this happen<br/>to him?")
('Researcher Aster', "I'm sorry. I need some time alone right now...")
('Researcher Aster', "I know it's not the time to talk about it, but...well, I<br/>won't be taking legal action against Professor<br/>Callaghan for this.")
('Researcher Aster', "I just can't bring myself to do that to him—I respect<br/>him too much. I can't ruin his reputation over this.")
('Researcher Aster', "But I'll hold on to the evidence you gathered for me.")
('Researcher Aster', 'For now, all I can do is just pray he comes back safe...')
('Researcher Aster', "Hmm... This theory could greatly simplify the<br/>equations we're using. I'll have to test that out at<br/>the lab.")
('Researcher Aster', "...Or, wait, no. I forgot, it's a total mess right now.<br/>I have to wait until it's cleared up.")
('Researcher Aster', "I need to do the professor proud. I can't screw<br/>this up...")
('Researcher Nadir', "Who could have imagined Professor Esmeray's<br/>research would be so relevant so quickly?")
('Researcher Nadir', 'I did briefly consider the possibility, but it seemed so<br/>far-fetched at the time. And yet here we are.')
('Researcher Nadir', 'Just what does Marduk intend to use this technology<br/>for, I wonder?')
('Researcher Nadir', "Ah, welcome... If you're looking for Risette, she's in<br/>the room to your right. The associate professor is<br/>with her.")
('Researcher Nadir', "She's through the worst of it now, at least—I've been<br/>in there helping her throughout the day.")
('Researcher Nadir', 'I never expected we would be putting her research to<br/>the test so soon—especially not under<br/>these circumstances.')
('Researcher Nadir', 'I suspect Professor Cronkite is at that roaming café<br/>I mentioned.')
('Researcher Nadir', "It's a guessing game where it'll be, but that's part of<br/>what makes it so popular here.")
('Researcher Nadir', "Professor Cronkite's started to catch on to some kind<br/>of pattern—he can predict where it'll be with<br/>astonishing accuracy.")
('Researcher Nadir', "I've heard loud shouting from one of the other<br/>labs, yes. It stunned me out of the work I was doing.")
('Researcher Nadir', "I don't know who was shouting, but they sounded<br/>awfully jaded—like they didn't care who heard them.")
('Researcher Nadir', "I'm afraid I can't recall any more than that, though.<br/>Forgive me.")
('Researcher Nadir', 'Something has to give, the way I see it. That lab is<br/>just woefully self-destructive...')
('Researcher Nadir', "I work as an assistant in Professor Archette's lab<br/>over there.")
('Researcher Nadir', "I've noticed some troubling things coming out of the<br/>other labs, though. This one woman, she's looked<br/>absolutely drained every day.")
('Researcher Nadir', "I wish there was something I could do to help her, but<br/>I really shouldn't go butting into other labs' business.")
('Researcher Nadir', 'I just hope she has someone she can talk to, be it a<br/>coworker, a professor, or someone else.')
('Researcher Nadir', "I wonder where Professor Esmeray's gotten to...?")
('Researcher Nadir', "I wanted to report back to her with the latest on our<br/>budget and samples, but she's nowhere to be found.")
('Researcher Nadir', 'Well, I can always just wait, I suppose. She must have<br/>been busy to have dumped so much work on me...<br/>as usual.')
('Van', "(That's a bit fishy there. Might have to ask him<br/>about that.)")
('Renne', "He did promise me earlier, but I can't guarantee it'll<br/>happen just yet. You never know, with how plans<br/>can change.")
('Renne', "Still, I can hardly think of a place in Basel I'm more<br/>interested in, so it's worth a shot!")
('Agnès', "Oh, hello, everyone! I didn't think I'd run into you<br/>all here.")
('Renne', "We just finished touring the Epstein Foundation and<br/>ZCF branches here, so now we're taking a brief tour<br/>of the institute.")
('Renne', "There's really not much we can do, though, since we<br/>can't attend any of the lectures here. Being honest, it's<br/>rather boring.")
('Albert', 'Boring for you, maybe... You sound like you already<br/>know about a lot of the stuff here.')
('Albert', "We're not as...encyclopedic as you, y'know? All this<br/>Epstein and ZCF stuff is brand new to me.")
('Odette', "She's just full of secrets, isn't she? But hey, we got to<br/>see and learn some really cool stuff because of it!")
('Odette', "Renne said she might have something extra special for<br/>us after we're done here, too!")
('Renne', "Heehee. Might is the key word, mind—I can't make<br/>any promises.")
('Agnès', '(What does she mean by that...?)')
('Van', "(Beats me. I'm not too worried about her—let her do<br/>her thing and us do ours.)")
('Odette', 'The Epstein Foundation was really<br/>something special!')
('Odette', 'We got to hear lots of interesting stories at the ZCF<br/>branch, too. Renne said that her best friend works<br/>there, even!')
('Odette', "She has so many of those connections... It's<br/>really mysterious. But hey, I'm not complaining!")
('Albert', "So, uh, how's everything been going on your<br/>end, Agnès?")
('Albert', 'If it all gets to be too much, you can join back up with<br/>us, okay?')
('Aaron', 'Miss Perfect is Miss Popular, too, huh?')
('Agnès', "Thanks, Albert. But I'm fine right now, honestly.")
('Albert', 'Well...all right. Glad to hear that.')
('Albert', "Just, I worry sometimes. There's some dangerous stuff<br/>out there, so don't go charging into all that, okay?")
('Albert', "We'll always be here for you.")
('Julian', "I've heard much about the institute of science, and I<br/>must say, it does live up to its reputation.")
('Julian', "It's the highest seat of learning in Calvard, after all.<br/>You have many of the country's brightest minds all<br/>under one roof.")
('Julian', "We won't be able to see the entire thing in one trip,<br/>but I hope I can at least catch the highlights while<br/>we're here.")
('Lyle', 'Yooo, Julian, did you get a look at that researcher<br/>who just walked by?')
('Lyle', 'She was a total knockout...! She had that science-y<br/>look to her, with the glasses and the messed-up hair...')
('Lyle', "It's not just me dreaming, is it? We've gotta be<br/>a match!")
('Julian', "Huh? Sorry, but I have no idea what you're on about.")
('Julian', '...Is she more beautiful than the aerotram attendant<br/>you were fawning over half an hour ago?')
('Lyle', "Dude, EVERYBODY here is a ten!<br/>There's something about this town, I swear...<br/>It's awakening something in me!")
('Chignon', "Uh, Lyle? Maybe quit while you're ahead.")
('Lyle', "I always assumed the institute was full of dudes.<br/>I didn't know there'd be so many chicks here, too.<br/>And man, some of 'em are bombshells!")
('Lyle', "...All right, that settles it. I'm applying to this place.")
('Chignon', "Oh, man! The Epstein tour was outta this world!<br/>I got to see some vintage memory quartz in there—<br/>how far we've come, huh?")
('Chignon', "I didn't know that photos and videos were first<br/>developed for astronomy.")
('Chignon', 'But soon enough, it branched out into other things,<br/>and that led to orbal films as we know them today!')
('Chignon', "It's just so cool to see how the medium took off!")
('Agnès', "Heehee. Glad to hear you're having fun.")
('Chignon', 'You bet!')
('Chignon', "I know you're busy with work and all, but you should<br/>see the sights yourself, Agnès!")
('Chignon', 'I heard the institute has the largest astral observatory<br/>in all of Calvard!')
('Chignon', 'I really want to go and see that now... Would we even<br/>be allowed inside, though?')
('James', "The hell'd Sasha run off to? She's always tellin' me<br/>not to go off on my own, but I guess she doesn't have<br/>to follow her own rules. Tch.")
('James', "I ain't cut out for this tour guide crap! Why'd she<br/>dump it all on me?")
('Sasha', 'Yeah, there was a bit of trouble over at the institute.')
('Sasha', "Looks like the CID's on the ground, too, so I was<br/>wondering if you'd heard anything?")
('Sasha', "Oh, come on! You can't do one little favor to help<br/>some frightened schoolchildren?")
('Agnès', '(Who is she talking to?)')
('Van', "(Hard to say... Can't deny I'm curious, but we got<br/>bigger fish to fry right now.)")
('Sasha', "I've gone over it with the Student Council president,<br/>but I'm still really unnerved about it.")
('Sasha', "C'mon, won't you help out some<br/>worried schoolchildren? Pleeeeease?")
('Researcher Ray', "I've always liked seeing people react to the things<br/>I make. I just never expected it would happen<br/>like this...")
('Researcher Ray', "Still, I'm glad it's available for her. The painkiller<br/>should make the limb fitting much easier for her.")
('Researcher Ray', 'Funny how it all worked out: you helped us and<br/>helped yourselves.')
('Van', "Man, same. Never expected one of our own would<br/>need the stuff we were helpin' to make.")
('Van', 'We really owe you for that, even if we helped out<br/>with it.')
('Researcher Ray', "Don't worry about it. I just chipped in here and<br/>there—the research was mostly Esmeray's—but I'm<br/>still honored I could help.")
('Researcher Ray', "All we can do now is leave the rest to her. She knows<br/>what she's doing.")
('Researcher Ray', "I'll still be out and about in the city helping treat<br/>the wounded.")
('Researcher Ray', "I came to Basel in part because I was deeply curious<br/>about the research here... It's just awful that this had<br/>to happen now.")
('Researcher Ray', 'But I plan on coming back someday, so I might as<br/>well help out here while I can. That way, I can help<br/>the city rebuild for my next visit.')
('Researcher Ray', 'Those cleanup volunteers must be all tuckered out...<br/>Perhaps an acerbic sandwich or two is what<br/>they need. Heh heh...')
('Researcher Ray', 'I came here to put my botanical chops to use. I was<br/>hoping to get a better look at the research they were<br/>conducting here...')
('Researcher Ray', "...but never in my wildest dreams did I expect this<br/>would happen. Now I'm at a loss...")
('Researcher Ray', "I do want to come back again someday... I think I'd<br/>best help the recovery effort—that way, there IS a city<br/>to come back to.")
('Researcher Ray', 'I like to think I know my herbs. I might be able to<br/>put that knowledge to work by treating the<br/>wounded here.')
('Van', "(Who's this guy? Foreign researcher, if I had to<br/>guess...and a real whack job, at that.)")
('Van', "(Guy ain't hurtin' anybody, at least, but I'll make a<br/>little mental note of him.)")
('Researcher Ray', "Once we're done here, we're heading back to the lab<br/>to synthesize some of that new painkiller.")
('Researcher Ray', 'Now that we have the theory down, we should have<br/>some working samples soon.')
('Researcher Ray', "I'm kind of excited to use it in the field for the<br/>first time. I think it'll really help.")
('Researcher Ray', "Bioengineering is a real hot field right now, and I<br/>can't deny I'm proud that my research could prove<br/>useful in it.")
('Researcher Ray', 'I hope this painkiller makes life easier for amputees<br/>and other patients.')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "The attachment process does hurt, unfortunately, but<br/>I'll do my best to make it as quick as possible.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'Risette is already familiar with artificial limbs, as it<br/>happens, so that should make it easier for her to<br/>adjust to them.')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "And I've got Marduk helping me out, too.<br/>We'll make sure it's done right!")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'Heehee. I knew I could rely on all of you!')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "And Quatre, I'm worried about Professor Callaghan<br/>as well, but please don't burn yourself out trying to fix<br/>this all by yourself.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "Now, Ray didn't catch my eye just for his Zemuria<br/>Moss research alone.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'I hope I get the chance to ask him about his other<br/>projects. For now, though, we need to focus on<br/>this painkiller.')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'Do let me know if you find any moss down there!')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "Just please don't get yourselves hurt in the process!<br/>That would be quite bad.")
('Risette', 'Oh... Hello... How is your investigation going...?')
('Agnès', "Oh! You're up already?")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'Please take it easy, Risette.')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'We just have you awake temporarily before we start<br/>doing the nerve work.')
('Van', "Oh, shit, sorry. We didn't mean to bother you.")
('Risette', "Not at all... I'm glad to see you... And it's good that<br/>you're still hard at work...")
('Risette', "I'll be going back to sleep now... Thank you for<br/>visiting me...")
('Risette', 'Be careful...out there...')
('Aaron', "Damn. Out like a light. She's really got it rough.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "She really does... I wasn't expecting her to wake up<br/>like that. She must have really wanted to see you.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "She might be conscious again, but she's not lucid<br/>most of the time. She must have heard your footsteps<br/>or otherwise noticed you coming.")
('Van', "Man... She's a real trooper. All the more reason to<br/>make good on her.")
('Van', "She's in your hands. We'll give her the good news<br/>when she wakes up.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "Don't worry. I'll take good care of her.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "She'll be all better by the time you get back, and that's<br/>a promise!")
('Risette', '...')
('Van', "Let's leave her be for now.")
('Van', "We got our own work to do—let's come back with<br/>good news for her.")
('Professor Cronkite', "This would not fall within the purview of a<br/>researcher, but if needs must, I'll not stop you.")
('Professor Cronkite', "I'm sure they would appreciate a mind as wise and<br/>rational as yours—provided you can control your<br/>impulses, of course.")
('Quatre', "I'll make sure of it! Please be careful yourself, Yang!")
('Professor Cronkite', "You needn't worry about me. I've started to recognize<br/>our enemy's patterns and movements.")
('Professor Cronkite', "You'd be wise not to overexert yourself. Bear your<br/>limits and abilities in mind.")
('Quatre', "(He's always so calm and collected, no matter what's<br/>happening around him... I have to be more like him!)")
('Professor Cronkite', 'I leave Quatre in your hands.')
('Professor Cronkite', "In the meantime, I will help the institute's evacuation<br/>efforts and direct security countermeasures as needed.")
('Professor Callaghan', 'This is RIDICULOUS!')
('Professor Callaghan', "You've had more than enough time! Why are the<br/>calculations still not done?!")
(40301, "B-But, Professor, it's impossible to be any more<br/>precise with our current equipment!")
(40303, 'Not even the most cutting-edge engineering science<br/>or orbal science will allow for—')
('Professor Callaghan', "I will not be told what is or isn't possible<br/>by ASSISTANTS! We knew about an inevitable lack<br/>of precision going into this!")
('Professor Callaghan', "The theory is complete—now do your job and find a<br/>way to realize it! It's as simple as that!")
('Professor Callaghan', 'You are working in the finest laboratory in all of<br/>Calvard, and it is high time that you started thinking<br/>like it!')
('Professor Callaghan', "Mmgh... Whatever. I'll be back to hear your results in<br/>the morning. Just get to making progress!")
(40301, '*sigh* Not another all-nighter...')
(40302, "I didn't think losing to Professor Cronkite would<br/>push him this far off the deep end...")
(40303, "*sigh* I don't disagree, but complaining isn't gonna<br/>get us anywhere. All we can do is get back to work...")
('Quatre', 'I knew it. This is the best time of day to see the Great<br/>Schedar Triangle.')
('Quatre', 'I just wish there was a little less cloud cover...')
('Quatre', 'By the looks of it, their conjunction will be about ten<br/>months from now, so that should do it for<br/>my homework.')
('Quatre', "I just hope she'll be back before then...")
('FIO', 'Who will be back?')
('Quatre', "Oh, don't mind me. It's nothing.")
('XEROS', 'GRR... RUFF!')
('FIO', "They said, 'Are you all right?'")
('Quatre', "Heh. Yeah, I'm fine. How could I not be when I've<br/>got the two of you?")
('Quatre', "And I'm not a child anymore. I can keep things safe<br/>in Gran's absence.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Aidios above, you're too young to always be<br/>so serious.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Hey there. How's it going so far?")
('Quatre', "I assume you mean with the new lens? I couldn't try it<br/>out fast enough.")
('Quatre', "It's accurate to 0.03 microarge. The engineers of the<br/>Artisanal District really are second to none.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Haha! Wasn't gonna settle for less than perfect on<br/>one of the professor's homework assignments.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "But I was really asking about you. You sure you're<br/>not working yourself too hard lately?")
('Quatre', "I'm fine—honestly, I am. But thank you for always<br/>caring about me.")
('Quatre', "It means a lot—especially since I'm sure you already<br/>have your hands full with work from above as it is.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Oh, I won't hear a word of that. You just leave<br/>worrying about that kinda stuff to me.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Everyone's got their role to play in the world, whether<br/>it's as a researcher or as an engineer.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "And we wouldn't be fit to call ourselves artisans of<br/>Basel if we weren't willing to come help the<br/>professor's favorite student.")
('Quatre', 'Well, uh...thank you very much, then.')
('Quatre', 'Oh! Excuse me.')
('Quatre', '...Mr. Tausend? What could the CEO want with<br/>someone like me?')
('Quatre', 'What?! Hold on a second! What do you—')
('Quatre', "But th-this is the professor's—I'm on my way!")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', 'Ugh... What nasty crap is Tausend up to this time?')
(500, 'October 23rd, 4:02PM')
('Agnès', "Here we are: the Basel Institute of Science. The place<br/>where much of the Republic's most cutting-edge<br/>research gets done.")
('Risette', "It's situated in such a beautiful location, too.<br/>The views of the canyon from here are just stunning.")
('Van', "Yeah. This area's supposed to be popular with tourists<br/>for exactly that reason—though even they need a card<br/>right now.")
('Aaron', "This isn't that bad of a spot to sightsee, I guess, but<br/>there's no real place to live it up in town.")
('Feri', 'Oh, speaking of tourism!')
('Feri', "What's that rounded building over there? I've been<br/>wondering this whole time.")
('Quatre', "That's the astronomy observatory.")
('Feri', "That's a place where you look at the stars, right?")
('Quatre', "That's right. There's a very powerful telescope there<br/>that lets you see far more of them than you could with<br/>the naked eye.")
('Quatre', 'There are many who believe that astronomy is the<br/>discipline from which all others draw their roots, even<br/>if others disagree.')
('Quatre', "It actually originated in the Central East, if you<br/>didn't know.")
('Feri', 'Whoa! Really?!')
('Aaron', 'Pretty sure they were big on stargazing in that fallen<br/>empire to the east back in the day, too.')
('Agnès', 'Heehee. This is turning out to be very educational.')
('Van', '(Huh...?)')
('Quatre', "Ahem! So, where would you like to start? I'd be<br/>happy to show you around if you want.")
('Van', "Nah, it's fine. We're just gonna wander around for a<br/>while and see what we find.")
('Van', "If you can tell us where the main facilities and<br/>research labs are, that'd be plenty.")
('Quatre', "Well, if you're sure... They're marked on the<br/>building's map already, but here you go.")
('Quatre', "Well, then. I've got work of my own to take care of,<br/>so I'll get going for now.")
('Quatre', "If anything comes up, you're always welcome to<br/>contact me on my Xipha.")
('Van', 'Thanks.')
('Feri', 'Aww... I was hoping we could stay with him longer.<br/>He knows so many cool things.')
('Agnès', 'I feel the same way, but it would be...difficult.')
('Aaron', "Yeah. He's just gonna get in the way when we start<br/>poking our noses around in dark places.")
('Van', "I doubt we're gonna get any new 4SPGs here, but<br/>here's hopin' we can learn more about this abusive<br/>professor, wherever they are.")
('Van', "Let's get to work. Remember to act casual and not<br/>make it obvious what we're here for.")
('Risette', 'Understood.')
('Agnès', "I can't believe you managed to deceive your way past<br/>someone again...")
('Van', "Hey, nothin' I said was a lie. Not my fault if someone<br/>else takes what I said the wrong way.")
('Aaron', 'Bet you tell yourself that every single time, huh?')
('Feri', 'Yeah... You must be a real pro at this.')
('Van', "I mean...it's not something to be proud of.")
('Risette', 'Haha. As your sudden embarrassment suggests.')
('Agnès', '*sigh* I wish you would at least stop to think about<br/>the bad influence you might be having on Feri.')
('Professor Callaghan', "So you're trying to blame all of this on me, are you?!")
('Professor Cronkite', 'Not at all. I am in no way trying to suggest your latest<br/>research is the cause.')
('Professor Cronkite', "If anything, the approach you're taking with your<br/>latest project rather fascinates me.")
('Professor Callaghan', '...Does it, now?')
('Professor Cronkite', 'That being said, work on my own project has reached<br/>a critical juncture.')
('Professor Cronkite', 'I cannot afford any issues with net traffic at this time.')
('Professor Callaghan', 'Gah... That certainly sounds like blame to<br/>me, Cronkite!')
('Professor Callaghan', "You may be one of Professor Hamilton's students, but<br/>that doesn't give you the right to—")
('Van', 'So sorry for the delay!')
('Professor Cronkite', '...Oh?')
('Professor Callaghan', 'Who the devil are you? This is a restricted area,<br/>you know!')
('Van', 'Not to worry. We have permission to be here.')
('Van', "Could either of you direct us to Professor David<br/>Callaghan's office?")
('Professor Callaghan', "Ah! So you're the ones I just heard about.")
('Professor Callaghan', "We're finished here, Cronkite. Now, if you would all<br/>follow me...")
('Quatre', 'Yang—erm, Professors Cronkite and Callaghan!')
('Odette', '...Huh? Funny running into you guys here.')
('Van', '(...Whoops.)')
('Agnès', '(We could say the same thing...)')
('Quatre', 'Mr. Arkride? Do you have business here?')
('Professor Cronkite', 'Quatre.')
('Professor Callaghan', 'What are you doing here, Salision? And who are<br/>these people with you?')
('Quatre', "They are students here on an educational visitation<br/>from the capital. I've been assisting them during<br/>their stay.")
('Renne', 'Professor Cronkite was gracious enough to extend us<br/>an invitation to visit him when we happened to see<br/>each other in town.')
('Renne', 'So we asked Mr. Salision if he could lead the way. ❤')
('Professor Cronkite', '*sigh* I do not believe I invited anyone but you—nor<br/>did I imply we should meet quite this soon.')
('Professor Cronkite', 'But I suppose chasing you away here would be more<br/>work than just humoring you. Very well. Follow me.')
('Odette', 'Really?!')
('Albert', 'It would be nothing short of incredible to see your<br/>work up close, Professor Cronkite!')
('Professor Callaghan', '...Hmph.')
('Renne', "Well, we'll get out of your hair now. We apologize for<br/>the interruption.")
('Renne', "I can see that you're very busy, but it would be a<br/>pleasure to speak more on another occasion,<br/>Professor Callaghan.")
('Professor Callaghan', '...Oh? Hmph. I suppose that can be arranged.')
('Professor Callaghan', "It must be nice to have enough free time to spend on<br/>such frivolous nonsense as 'educational visitations.'")
('Professor Callaghan', 'Well, come with me. I want to make this brief.')
('Van', 'Of course, Professor.')
('Quatre', 'Wait.')
('Quatre', "I'd like to listen in on this conversation, too, if you<br/>don't mind.")
('Quatre', 'As their guide, I suspect it has EVERYTHING to do<br/>with me.')
('Professor Callaghan', 'Take a ten-minute break. Do not return late.')
(40301, 'Y-Yes, Professor...')
(40302, 'Excuse us...')
('Professor Callaghan', 'As you know, my name is David Callaghan.')
('Professor Callaghan', "I believe you're here to talk about Elsaim and Marduk<br/>investing in my research?")
('Professor Callaghan', "That makes for a very interesting combination, if you<br/>don't mind me saying. What exactly led to this?")
('Van', 'Is that what you were told? There seems to have been<br/>a misunderstanding, then.')
('Van', "We are currently working for Elsaim, and we do have<br/>a Marduk employee with us, but that's all.")
('Professor Callaghan', 'Wh-What...?')
('Van', "We're currently in the middle of an investigation, you<br/>see—and a lead happened to bring us here.")
('Van', 'Wanted to follow up on a rumor that some extreme<br/>abuse of power has been taking place in a<br/>laboratory here.')
('Professor Callaghan', '...?!')
('Quatre', '...')
('Aaron', "Heh. That's the face of a guy who's got something<br/>to tell.")
('Professor Callaghan', '...Who asked you to investigate this?')
('Van', "Couldn't tell you—didn't leave their name. But they<br/>did tell us all about what's been happening.")
('Van', "We've heard all about the ridiculous workloads and<br/>insane hours they and their colleagues have been<br/>forced to endure.")
('Van', "About how they're never allowed any rest, are<br/>woefully underpaid, and how they receive vicious,<br/>constant verbal abuse from their superior.")
('Van', 'Even to the point that someone collapsed from<br/>overwork and has been driven to the brink of suicide.')
('Professor Callaghan', '...')
('Quatre', "That's just...")
('Van', "We have all the testimony and evidence we need to<br/>act if that's what it comes to.")
('Van', 'But we thought it better to come and hear your<br/>thoughts first.')
('Professor Callaghan', '...Excuse me?')
('Agnès', "It's... It's not too late to turn things around.")
('Agnès', "So many people we spoke to were quick to say that<br/>you weren't always like this.")
('Agnès', "They mentioned how they almost had trouble<br/>believing just what you'd become.")
('Feri', "We could see how afraid people are of you now, and<br/>how they dislike what you've become...")
('Feri', '...but at the same time, we could see how deeply they<br/>respect you, too.')
('Professor Callaghan', '...')
('Van', "We're not heroes of justice like the cops or the guild.")
('Van', "We're just about findin' common ground and puttin'<br/>things to right.")
('Van', "Long as you're willing to work with us, we can—")
('Professor Callaghan', 'That is ENOUGH!')
('Professor Callaghan', "Don't talk to me about respect and then<br/>immediately resort to blackmail!")
('Professor Callaghan', 'I cannot believe one of my assistants would try to set<br/>me up like this... Unbelievable!')
('Professor Callaghan', 'I give them a golden chance to help me<br/>obtain glory beyond their imagination, and<br/>THIS is how they choose to repay me?!')
('Agnès', '...')
('Feri', 'How could you say that...?')
('Aaron', "You know we've got evidence of what you're<br/>doing, right? Sure you wanna pick this fight?")
('Professor Callaghan', "Do what you will with your 'evidence.' All I have to<br/>do is cover it up!")
('Professor Callaghan', "No one's going to believe some lowly assistants over<br/>an esteemed professor!")
('Van', '...')
('Quatre', 'Professor...')
('Professor Callaghan', 'I am one—no—two mere steps away from<br/>completing my research, and they pick now to<br/>sabotage my efforts?!')
('Professor Callaghan', "Very well! Then damn the human cost! I'll start<br/>working them to the bone to make up for their—")
('Quatre', 'Just listen to yourself, Professor!')
('Quatre', 'What has gotten into you?!')
('Quatre', 'You used to be so kind and supportive!<br/>Professor Hamilton held you in such high regard!')
('Quatre', 'Even though I was one of her students, you would<br/>still take the time to look after me...')
('Quatre', "I-I just can't understand why all you do lately is spit<br/>in the face of her achievements!")
('Agnès', 'Quatre...')
('Risette', '(I suspected as much.)')
('Quatre', "...Sorry. That's a private matter between us.")
('Quatre', "But please, at least stop and think about how you're<br/>treating the people who work under you.")
('Quatre', "They took their positions because they dreamed of<br/>being like you—don't belittle them or their work!")
('Professor Callaghan', 'Salision...')
('Professor Callaghan', "Don't tell me what I can and can't do, you<br/>third-rate apprentice!")
('Quatre', '...')
('Agnès', 'Quatre!')
('Feri', "What do you think you're doing?!")
('Aaron', 'Listen, asshole...')
('Professor Callaghan', "You're talking to the famous David Callaghan!")
('Professor Callaghan', "The preeminent scholar of engineering science and<br/>military technology who has long upheld the very<br/>foundation of this nation's national defense!")
('Professor Callaghan', "I've had enough of youngsters like Cronkite and<br/>Esmeray acting like they're above me after all<br/>I've achieved!")
('Professor Callaghan', 'My latest research will propel Calvard to even greater<br/>heights—change the power balance of the<br/>entire continent!')
('Professor Callaghan', 'Why can no one understand just how much<br/>of a privilege it is to help with that?!')
('Quatre', 'Professor...')
('Van', "Well, you're free to have whatever lofty goals<br/>you want...")
('Van', "...but I think we've had our ten minutes. Don't you?")
('Agnès', 'Oh...')
('Van', 'We came here to explain the situation and offer a<br/>solution we thought would benefit everyone.')
('Van', "You're welcome to try and cover up all the evidence<br/>and testimonies we've gathered, but I promise you—it<br/>ain't gonna be easy.")
('Van', "If you're as close to this 'revolution' as you claim to<br/>be, then I'd give it another thinking through if I<br/>were you.")
('Professor Callaghan', '...Hmph. I am done wasting time with you.')
('Professor Callaghan', 'I will be raising the issue of your illegal trespassing<br/>and appalling brazenness with Mr. Tausend.')
('Professor Callaghan', '...I admit that I may have been a little too harsh.')
('Professor Callaghan', 'But as long as you intend to cling to Professor<br/>Hamilton instead of aiming for something more, I<br/>have no interest in you.')
('Professor Callaghan', 'Unless you now see the benefits of developing your<br/>talents under me after all?')
('Professor Callaghan', "I would wager that would be a far better use of your<br/>time than waiting like a little girl for an old woman<br/>who's long gone.")
('Quatre', '...Excuse me!')
('Agnès', 'Quatre!')
('Risette', '...Pardon us.')
('Quatre', 'Like a little girl...')
('Van', 'There you are.')
('Aaron', 'So this is what it looks like inside, huh?')
('Feri', "It's so cool seeing the observatory... Ah! Is that<br/>the telescope?")
('Quatre', "That's right. Professor Hamilton had it<br/>specially made.")
('Quatre', "I'm sorry you had to witness that earlier...but I'm<br/>impressed you knew where to find me.")
('Van', 'Just had a feeling.')
('Van', "We're happy to forget what we saw as long as you<br/>forget about us forcin' our way into the<br/>research building.")
('Agnès', 'Van, behave...')
('Quatre', 'Haha...')
('Quatre', "You can go ahead and have a seat over there. I'll go<br/>make us some tea.")
('Agnès', "So there aren't actually any astronomy<br/>professors here?")
('Quatre', "Not at the moment. I'm the only one who comes here<br/>every day right now.")
('Quatre', 'But there was a time when quite a few researchers<br/>and students who all adored Professor Hamilton<br/>would come.')
('Quatre', 'Even Professor Callaghan would from time to time.')
('Feri', 'Oh...')
('Quatre', 'He never used to be like he is now.')
('Quatre', "He's always seen Professor Hamilton as a rival, sure...")
('Quatre', '...but it used to be the friendly kind of rivalry that was<br/>beneficial to both sides. He taught me so much, too.')
('Agnès', 'He really must have changed, then...')
('Aaron', "Yeah. From that to the uptight abusive asshole we<br/>saw earlier's some kinda fall.")
('Risette', 'Professor Hamilton left the Republic two years ago, if<br/>I recall.')
('Van', "And you're one of her students?")
('Quatre', "That's right. I owe more to her than I can ever hope<br/>to repay.")
('Quatre', "I've been looking after the observatory and her house<br/>since she left the country.")
('Quatre', "Though I think it's debatable whether I'm doing a<br/>good job of it...")
('Quatre', "The CEO of Verne, Mr. Tausend, is also one of the<br/>directors on the institute's board.")
('Quatre', "And he told me that he's considering shutting this<br/>place down because so few people are using it...")
('Feri', 'Oh, no...')
('Van', "So that's why you've been doing all kinds of<br/>miscellaneous tasks to score points with him?")
('Agnès', "That's awful...")
('Quatre', "...I really am sorry about earlier, though. I ended up<br/>interfering in your investigation by jumping in,<br/>didn't I?")
('Quatre', "If I hadn't said anything...")
('Van', "Don't sweat it. We ended up getting some useful info<br/>outta that whole outburst.")
('Van', "My guess is you've noticed this by now, too...")
('Van', "...but his piss-poor attitude isn't the only bad thing<br/>going on with him.")
('Quatre', '...')
('Feri', 'Y-You really think so?')
('Agnès', 'I have the same feeling.')
('Agnès', 'It would explain why someone so respected has<br/>stooped to such irrational behavior.')
('Aaron', "Feels like the question is, what is he trying to do that<br/>he's willing to go so far off the deep end for it?")
('Risette', 'The computer hardware in his laboratory was state of<br/>the art.')
('Risette', "I suspect he's using it to perform vast calculations.")
('Risette', 'The kind that would be equally difficult to<br/>properly manage.')
('Quatre', 'I agree.')
('Quatre', "I've never seen a simulation of this extent before—<br/>and it seemed even that wasn't getting the results<br/>he wanted.")
('Quatre', "(He couldn't be... No, but that would...)")
('Risette', '(...I see now.)')
('Van', "Well, we'd better keep an eye on that guy for a while.")
('Van', "We ain't in Basel for that long, but we're gonna be<br/>here for the next couple of days, at least.")
('Van', "Feels like we can afford to scratch each other's backs<br/>a bit, yeah? Whether that CEO wants us to or not.")
('Quatre', '...All right. I do have my doubts about you, but I<br/>believe that Agnès is worthy of my trust.')
('Quatre', "So if anything comes up, I'll be sure to let you<br/>know—to keep what the professor left behind safe, if<br/>nothing else.")
('Van', "*sigh* Nothin' comes from not bein' honest with<br/>yourself, y'know.")
('Agnès', "Heehee. We'll be counting on you, Quatre.")
('Aaron', "Sure seems like he's being honest with himself to me.<br/>Not trusting you is the right call.")
('Quatre', 'Oh, you are very much in the same boat with how<br/>boorish you are.')
('Aaron', "'Scuse me? You trying to pick a fight, kiddo?")
('Quatre', "That's only proving my point, you know.")
('Feri', 'Ahaha...')
('Quatre', 'Are you interested in the telescope?')
('Feri', "I-I just... I was just wondering what it's like, that's all.")
('Quatre', "Haha... It's only just past five o'clock, so we won't be<br/>getting a great view of the stars quite yet.")
('Quatre', 'But come with me—you still might be able to get a<br/>good view of the Great Schedar Triangle.')
('Feri', 'Really?! Yay!')
('Agnès', 'Aww...')
('Aaron', 'Course the two kids of the group would hit it off.')
('Van', "You're also still a damn kid from my perspective.")
('Van', '...By the way, Agnès.')
('Van', "Was it just me, or did you seem surprised by<br/>somethin' when that professor was shoutin' up<br/>a storm?")
('Agnès', "...It wasn't just you.")
('Julian', 'I cannot believe one of my assistants would try to set<br/>me up like this... Unbelievable!')
('Julian', 'I give them a golden chance to help me<br/>obtain glory beyond their imagination, and<br/>THIS is how they choose to repay me?!')
('Agnès', '...')
('Risette', 'So it picked then of all times to shine...')
('Agnès', "It's not doing it now, though... Do you think it could<br/>just be a coincidence?")
('Van', '...You gotta wonder.')
('Van', "Not like it'd be the first time it shone at an odd time.<br/>Like when we first ran into Grimcat.")
('Odette', "Whoa! What's THIS room for?")
('Agnès', 'Odette? What brings you all here?')
('Odette', "Found you! We've been looking for all of you!")
('Renne', "We couldn't find you anywhere in the main building,<br/>so we wondered if you might be here.")
('Van', "Heh. Sorry for puttin' you guys out.")
('Albert', 'Well, not all of us are here for you.')
('Julian', "So this is their giant telescope! I've seen one in the<br/>Imperial Museum, too, but it's so cool!")
('Chignon', 'Oooh! Can we take a look through it?!')
('Quatre', "(It's nice seeing this place this lively again... It's been<br/>so long.)")
(500, 'October 23rd, 6:10PM')
('Quatre', 'Again...?')
('Quatre', 'Some of our research was supposedly used in making<br/>it, too.')
('Quatre', 'What is it, FIO?')
(500, 'October 23rd, 10:05PM')
('Quatre', "There you are. I'm glad you all came.")
('Van', 'Yep. Hey there.')
('Aaron', "Wait a sec. Haven't we met this chick?")
('Feri', "That's right! Earlier today!")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'Ohh! I remember you, too!')
('Quatre', "I wasn't aware that you had already met.")
('Quatre', "This is Associate Professor Esmeray, another one<br/>of Professor Hamilton's students.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "Heehee. That's meee. My full name is<br/>Esmeray Archette.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "What a surprise. So YOU are the problem solvers I've<br/>heard so much about.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'And one of you is just TOO ADOOORABLE!')
('Feri', 'Aaah!')
('Quatre', "Please, Essy. This isn't the time for that.")
('Quatre', 'Umm... I did tell her to go home, but she insisted on<br/>staying to help us.')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'Hmph! Why must you be so cold, Quatre?')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'I could never abandon my little brother in his<br/>moment of need!')
('Quatre', "'Little brother'? We're just students under the<br/>same professor...")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "What do you mean, 'just'? Here's what you get for<br/>being so mean! C'meeere!")
('Quatre', 'Oof! St-Stop that, please!')
('Aaron', 'Man... Think we could swap bodies for a sec, kiddo?')
('Van', 'Well, the more people familiar with this place that we<br/>have to show us around, the better.')
('Van', "The bigger our group, the higher our chances of<br/>finding this intruder we're here for.")
('Quatre', "That's true. I didn't see them directly, just to be clear.")
('Quatre', "But FIO's sensors detected an unregistered individual<br/>entering the building.")
('Aaron', "So they didn't use that stupid card to get in there?")
('Risette', "It's also worth considering that the security system<br/>used here is too advanced for just anyone to be able to<br/>slip through it.")
('Risette', "I would consider that this could be FIO's sensors<br/>malfunctioning, but as it is a drone based on Xipha<br/>technology, I very much doubt it.")
('FIO', 'The reading is correct. I am sure.')
('Van', "Well, let's see what we can do.")
('Van', "We might find ourselves stumblin' on clues we<br/>couldn't find earlier today, if we're lucky.")
('Van', "We're takin' you two with us, but just be<br/>careful, okay?")
('Quatre', "We'll be fine. We have FIO and XEROS with us,<br/>after all.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "Let's get to work!")
('XEROS', 'RUFF!')
('FIO', 'Engaging search mode.')
('Aaron', "Wouldn't kill us to be more tense here.")
('Feri', 'Ahaha...')
('Feri', 'The institute is so...moody at this time of night.')
('Van', "Oh? Feelin' scared?")
('Feri', 'O-Of course not! A Kruga warrior would never be<br/>afraid of something like ghosts!')
('Feri', "I-I'm not remembering all the ghost stories I heard at<br/>school or anything. That would be s-silly!")
('Van', 'All right, all right.')
('FIO', 'Small quantity of residual shards detected.')
('Quatre', 'Shards? Here?')
('Feri', 'So someone used their Xipha here?')
('Van', "Let's have a quick look around just in case.")
('Quatre', "The cafeteria's empty, huh?")
('Feri', "Whew... I can't sense anyone here, either.")
('Van', 'By the way, was that green-haired girl the only one<br/>left in the building when we got here, apart from<br/>our intruder?')
('Quatre', "Not quite. Professor Cronkite already returned home<br/>for the day, so he won't be here...")
('Quatre', '...but there are also several security guards, along with<br/>Professor Callaghan and his assistants.')
('Quatre', 'I tried calling out to them from the other side of the<br/>door, but they were too focused on their work<br/>to notice.')
('Feri', 'No surprise there, I guess.')
('Van', "Well, let's just put them out of our minds for the<br/>time being.")
('Van', "Professor Hamilton's students sure are an eclectic<br/>bunch, huh? You included.")
('Quatre', "I don't want to hear that from you... Still, I think that<br/>just goes to show how open-minded she is.")
('Quatre', "She doesn't care about race, upbringing, or anything<br/>other than finding the good in everyone, then<br/>working to better bring it out.")
('Quatre', "Everyone knows her as the mother of the Orbal<br/>Revolution, but even to this day, she's striving to<br/>develop technology to help those in need.")
('Quatre', "On top of that, she's kind, considerate... I've never<br/>met anyone like her.")
('Feri', "She sounds amazing. She was the one responsible for<br/>reviving and expanding Tharbad's oasis, too,<br/>wasn't she?")
('Van', 'I can really tell just how much you respect her.')
('Quatre', 'I could never NOT respect her.')
('Van', '(This feels like...)')
('Risette', 'So the house we visited earlier today is where Mr.<br/>Salision and Professor Hamilton live, then?')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "That's right. The professor took him in nine years<br/>ago, and he's been living with her since.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'The two of them, along with me and Professor<br/>Cronkite, are like a family now.')
('Aaron', "So that's why people call him her favorite.")
('Risette', 'If she left the country two and a half years<br/>ago, however...')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "That's right... He puts on a brave face, but he misses<br/>her so much.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "She's off trying to solve the problems in the East, so<br/>there's no telling when she's going to be back.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', '...The story about closing down the observatory<br/>seemed to come about because of me and Professor<br/>Cronkite, too.')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'But he never confided in us. Instead, he tried to fix<br/>the problem all on his own.')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "And Professor Cronkite's really busy at the moment,<br/>so he can't be around very much.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'I just wish I could pick up the slack and support<br/>Quatre like a real big sister should.')
('Aaron', "Kiddo's got a pattern, huh? He was trying to sort out<br/>that problem down in the mine alone, too.")
('Aaron', "But he's at the kinda age when kids wanna act older<br/>than they are. Better to just leave him be if you<br/>ask me.")
('Risette', "Perhaps you're right—but being there for one another<br/>is what families do.")
('Risette', "I'm a little envious, to be honest...")
('Aaron', '...Oh?')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'Hmm?')
('XEROS', 'RUFF!')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'Did you find something, XEROS?!')
('Aaron', "Guess we'd better give it a look. We sure didn't find<br/>anything downstairs, though, so I'm not getting my<br/>hopes up.")
('Risette', "I agree. Let's see if we can find anything.")
('Aaron', 'See? Nothing here.')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "Well, that's strange...")
('XEROS', 'GRR...')
('Risette', 'The door is ajar...')
('Aaron', "Did it just open itself? No, that doesn't—")
('XEROS', 'RUFF!')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'Where are you going, XEROS?')
('Feri', '...Hmm?')
('Quatre', 'What is it, XEROS?')
('Van', 'There!')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', '...')
('Aaron', 'Wait. Was that—?')
('Van', "Whoever they are, they ain't just usin' stealth shards.")
('Risette', 'They appear to be combining them with<br/>something else.')
('Quatre', "FIO! We're going after them!")
('FIO', 'Understood.')
('Van', "We're going, too!")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'W-Wait for meee...!')
('FIO', 'Heat signature detected!')
('Quatre', 'XEROS!')
('XEROS', 'GRR... RUFF!')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', 'Ack!')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', 'W-Wait! I surrender, I surrender!')
('Feri', 'A woman...? She looks kind of familiar.')
('Aaron', "And there was me thinking it'd be that kinky cat or<br/>someone from the mafia.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "*pant* Huh? Who's that?")
('Risette', '...She must not be a member of the faculty, then.')
('Van', "Man... It did cross my mind it might be you, but I<br/>wouldn't have put mira on it.")
('Van', "This here is one of Kincaid's subordinates. I don't<br/>think I ever caught your name?")
('Feri', 'Oh!')
('Aaron', "So it's the desk jockey's gofer, huh?")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "Y-You watch what you're calling me!")
('Quatre', 'Hmm? Is this an acquaintance of yours?')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', '*sigh* I was hoping not to make contact with you<br/>while I was here...')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', '...but I see I underestimated just how friendly you<br/>would get with the faculty here in less than<br/>twenty-four hours.')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', 'I did hear you had a way of conning everyone you<br/>meet into liking you, Arkride, but you work fast.')
('Van', "I ain't connin' anyone. I'm just that likeable.")
('Van', "Also, if you're gonna try to burn someone, maybe try<br/>doin' it when you're not pinned under a dog.")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "Y-You think I'm enjoying this?! Just get it off me!")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "My name's Kaela McMillan. That's my real name, for<br/>what it's worth.")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "I'm a second lieutenant in the CID—and I'd prefer it<br/>if that and all we discuss are kept off the record.")
('Quatre', 'I thought you were here on a job from Elsaim?')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'So the CID is also involved, then?')
('Van', 'Yeah. We knew that CEO might try to hide stuff<br/>from us, so we kept one of our clients a secret.')
('Van', "We just didn't expect one of their guys to use a mix of<br/>Xipha and RAMDA stealth to sneak in here.")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', 'I apologize for the trouble I ended up causing.')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "My intention was to investigate so we had a backup<br/>in the event you didn't succeed. I never expected to<br/>be found.")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "Clearly, I shouldn't have underestimated the Institute<br/>of Science's technological prowess.")
('FIO', 'FIO is cool?')
('Quatre', 'Of course. Very cool.')
('Aaron', "I don't get it. Why sneak in here at all? You couldn't<br/>just let us do our thing?")
('Van', 'I assume she concluded that the current situation was<br/>too serious NOT to do anything.')
('Van', 'That about the long and short of it?')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', '...')
('Quatre', 'Hmm...')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'The current state of the orbal network and<br/>distribution network is definitely a problem.')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'I had them go down on me the other day, too.<br/>We managed to get things running again, but it was<br/>still a big hassle.')
('Feri', 'But just why is this happening at all?')
('Risette', "There's only one possibility that I can propose.")
('Risette', 'That would be unusually intensive<br/>parallel-distributed computing.')
('Quatre', '...')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "Hmm... I'm no expert in the field, but that's all that<br/>comes to mind for me, too.")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "Then we're of the same mind.")
('Feri', "I'm totally lost...")
('Aaron', "Yeah. The hell're you guys talking about?")
('Van', 'Orbal computers have been getting bigger and faster<br/>over the past few years.')
('Van', 'And the bigger they get, the more orbal energy<br/>they consume.')
('Risette', 'In short, yes. The larger and more complex the tasks<br/>you require of them, the more power they<br/>will consume.')
('Risette', "Orbments regenerate orbal energy over time and<br/>don't generally need an external power source.")
('Risette', "That changes, however, when the amount of energy<br/>consumed vastly exceeds the orbment's ability to<br/>generate it.")
('Risette', 'Yet if the orbal distribution network that serves as<br/>that external source is also heavily taxed...')
('Quatre', '...that leads to a temporary decrease in the amount of<br/>energy available, and a spike in the amount of orbal<br/>network traffic.')
('Quatre', "That theory alone would be enough to explain the<br/>issues you're here to investigate.")
('Feri', '...!')
('Quatre', "Still, while it's possible on paper, I can't imagine<br/>parallel-distributed computing taking place on such a<br/>vast scale.")
('Quatre', "As for controlling the orbal distribution network<br/>itself...that's simply unimaginable with<br/>current technology.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "We still don't know all there is about orbal energy<br/>and how it works.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'Oh! But wait...')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', 'Yeah. A situation mirroring that unimaginable<br/>scenario happened not all that long ago.')
('Risette', 'Indeed. We analyzed that situation ourselves at<br/>Marduk and reached the same conclusion about<br/>what happened.')
('Feri', 'Risette...')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', 'That confirms it, then.')
('Aaron', 'She finally clues us in.')
('Aaron', "I've heard some about what went down in Crossbell,<br/>but if this is the same as that, well, that spells trouble<br/>for us.")
('Feri', "Right. And this isn't the first time we've run into<br/>something connected to that whole incident, either.")
('Van', "Don't know if they're deliberately settin' out to<br/>replicate Crossbell's deal, but there's one thing we<br/>need to get cleared up right off the bat.")
('Van', "We've gotta assume someone's out there tryin' to do<br/>research they shouldn't that can only be done with<br/>parallel-distributed computing.")
('Van', 'So the question becomes: who is it?')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "What's the point in asking a question with only one<br/>clear answer?")
('Quatre', 'Professor Callaghan...')
('Quatre', "...Just what does he think he's doing?!")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "He's changed a ton over the past few years, but I<br/>didn't think he was up to something of<br/>this magnitude...")
('Quatre', '...? Th-This number belongs to...!')
('Professor Callaghan', 'Is... Is that you, Salision...?')
('Quatre', "P-Professor Callaghan? What's wrong, sir?")
('Professor Callaghan', "I'm so sorry... I screwed up...")
('Professor Callaghan', 'Please, stop this... Th-They want my—')
('Professor Callaghan', 'Aaaaargh!')
('Quatre', 'Professor?! Professor Callaghan!')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', 'What just happened?')
('Van', "He's in the special research building, right?!")
('Risette', 'We must hurry!')
('Quatre', '...')
('Van', 'Damn...')
(40301, 'Ngh...')
(40302, '...')
('Quatre', 'Professor! Where are you, Professor?!')
(500, 'October 24th, 10:00AM')
(40301, "Heeeeeelp! There's mechanical monsters coming!")
('Professor Cronkite', 'The aerotrams are inoperable! Use the bridge to cross<br/>into the Artisanal District!')
('Professor Cronkite', 'Evacuate into the church for the time being!<br/>Bracers will be there in roughly ten minutes!')
('Quatre', "Yang! You're okay!")
('Professor Cronkite', 'You made it—and roughly two minutes ahead of<br/>what I expected, at that.')
('Van', "Just about. You're weirdly calm with everything<br/>goin' on.")
('Aaron', "Didn't Almata come through here?")
('Professor Cronkite', 'They did—as I predicted.')
('Professor Cronkite', "Professor Callaghan's death also did not come as<br/>a surprise.")
('Quatre', '...?!')
('Agnès', 'Then you...')
('Professor Cronkite', 'I have implemented security measures to temporarily<br/>block all unauthorized external interference into<br/>the laboratories.')
('Professor Cronkite', 'As a result, my work in the city has been complete<br/>since noon today.')
('Professor Cronkite', 'In light of that, I would be well within my rights to be<br/>out of the city by now, but I owe the students at least<br/>this much.')
('Professor Cronkite', 'That is why I have been assisting the one formerly<br/>known as Kitty with evacuating everyone while<br/>awaiting your arrival.')
('Quatre', "Yang...you're really going to leave?")
('Risette', "I can't believe you were able to conceive of effective<br/>countermeasures to that parallel-distributed<br/>computing in such a short time.")
('Van', "Don't really care what goes on in that head of yours,<br/>but I see you're at least willin' to cooperate with<br/>us some.")
('Van', "I know there's a lot of archaisms inside now, but did<br/>we just see the last people in the building leave?")
('Professor Cronkite', 'All of the faculty and the students of Aramis,<br/>together with tourists and other accounted-for<br/>visitors, have left.')
('Professor Cronkite', 'However, security camera footage captured a young<br/>man with mint-colored hair and a young woman<br/>adorned with bandages inside.')
('Professor Cronkite', 'A bracer and two police officers also passed through<br/>here earlier and have yet to return.')
('Aaron', 'So that sadistic bastard is here.')
('Feri', 'And so is that puppeteer we met in Tharbad...')
('Agnès', "I'm worried about the bracer and the police<br/>officers now...")
('Quatre', "So they're part of the mafia that deceived Professor<br/>Callaghan and then cast him aside...")
('Quatre', "I won't let them make a mess of Professor Hamilton's<br/>home a moment longer!")
('Professor Cronkite', "You're going inside, then?")
('Professor Cronkite', 'Surely you know that this is no task for a researcher.')
('Quatre', '...Please continue to help with the evacuation<br/>efforts, Yang.')
('Quatre', "Don't worry about me. I have FIO and XEROS<br/>with me!")
('Agnès', "We'll help keep him safe, of course.")
('Van', "There's no way this is ending peacefully anymore, but<br/>we'll at least try and stop things from getting<br/>any worse.")
('Professor Cronkite', "Don't overdo it, then, is all I ask. Even if you do have<br/>FIO and XEROS with you.")
('Quatre', "I know! I won't!")
('Feri', "Look! There's people on the ground!")
('Agnès', 'Are you all right?!')
(40301, 'Ngh...')
('Bracer Blanca', "You're...")
('Risette', "They look heavily wounded, but their lives aren't in<br/>immediate danger.")
('Van', 'What happened?')
('Bracer Blanca', 'A guy with a dagger and a girl with a giant puppet<br/>went...inside...')
('Bracer Blanca', 'They... They activated...')
('Quatre', 'I imagine she was going to mention the<br/>central terminal. But how could someone from the<br/>outside know about that?')
('Aaron', 'Maybe the professor told them before they<br/>killed him? Well, we got them cornered now.')
('Van', "Yeah. Let's get inside.")
('Feri', "It's time to put an end to this!")
('Feri', "The telescope's nowhere to be seen now...")
('Van', "That's the main terminal, then?")
('Quatre', "That's right. It's also known as the Aurora, and it's<br/>the pride of Basel.")
('Quatre', "Professors Hamilton and Callaghan led the charge in<br/>making it four years ago with the institute, Verne, the<br/>Epstein Foundation, and ZCF's support.")
('Quatre', '...But what program is it running?')
('Risette', "I can't make heads or tails of such complex code...")
('Agnès', 'Look up there!')
('Van', "...The fifth Genesis. Figures we'd find it here.")
('Van', 'Along with...')
('Olympia', 'I suspected you would come, Arkride Solutions.')
('Melchior', 'Oh, that we would meet again so soon after the<br/>film festival.')
('Melchior', "It must be Aidios' will bringing us together.<br/>The threads of fate bind us ever so strongly indeed.")
('Aaron', "Heheheh... Can't say I'm not a fan of that kinda thing.")
('Feri', 'The monsters from the Gardens who stole Aida<br/>from us!')
('Melchior', 'Oho! You learned the name of my old home, did you?')
('Melchior', 'And I see that Marduk concierge has officially joined<br/>your ranks.')
('Melchior', "Professor Hamilton's favorite little one, too.<br/>Aren't we getting popular?")
('Van', "Hmph. This kid's just with us as an advisor.")
('Quatre', "So you're the ones who led Professor<br/>Callaghan astray.")
('Quatre', 'What are you trying to do with the Aurora?!<br/>You have no right to be using it!')
('Melchior', "Oh, how misunderstood I am! I'll have you know that<br/>the professor and I had quite a special connection.")
('Melchior', 'In fact, he gave us permission to use it. And since he<br/>was one of the developers, I think that DOES give us<br/>the right.')
('Melchior', 'This was very different from the relationship I had<br/>with President Dillon, by the way. It was more one of<br/>mutual benefit.')
('Melchior', "Though I'll admit that...certain inclinations of his did<br/>make my job a lot easier.")
('Melchior', 'A sensual whisper here, a little buttering up there,<br/>and he was more than ready to break every taboo I<br/>ever wanted. ❤')
('Quatre', '...')
('Risette', 'How could you exploit someone so?')
('Aaron', "Eh, it's not our place to judge what turns someone on.<br/>That stuff's personal.")
('Aaron', "But you're still a piece of shit with a parking spot<br/>reserved in Gehenna.")
('Feri', "Right. And we'll be happy to give you a taste of the<br/>flames that await you right here.")
('Feri', "We're going to recover that Genesis and avenge those<br/>you've taken from this world!")
('Melchior', 'Ahaha! Look at me, public enemy number one.<br/>Think you could lend me a shoulder to cry<br/>on, Olympia?')
('Olympia', 'You are only reaping what you sowed.')
('Olympia', 'Of course, the terms of my contract also do not allow<br/>me to simply give you all what you want.')
('Agnès', 'That angelic being we saw in Tharbad!')
('Quatre', 'FIO!')
('FIO', 'Scanning material makeup... Unknown.<br/>High probability that the target is a form of artifact.')
('Van', "Thought so. It's about the only thing that explains<br/>how it can fight like it does.")
('Van', "There's more to it than meets the eye, too.")
('Risette', 'Indeed. Take care, everyone.')
('Olympia', 'Your instincts serve you well.')
('Olympia', 'Incidentally, as I did not have the opportunity to<br/>introduce myself in Tharbad...')
('Olympia', 'I am Olympia, overseer of the Garden of Aurum.<br/>This is Ishtanti.')
('Olympia', 'Our contract is with Almata at this time, so we<br/>remain focused on their needs...')
('Olympia', '...but should you require our services after that, we<br/>would be happy to oblige.')
('Feri', '...?!')
('Agnès', "Y-You're asking if we want to hire an assassin...?")
('Aaron', 'This some kinda joke? Or are you really out of your<br/>damn mind?')
('Olympia', '...Hmm? I was only trying to promote my services.')
('Melchior', "It's true! She's not capable of joking, I'm afraid.<br/>As you can see, she's got work on the brain.")
('Melchior', "Well, I think that's enough preamble. Been a good<br/>while, you know...since I tapped into my power as<br/>an overseer.")
('Aaron', '...!')
('Feri', '*gasp* Their auras!')
('Van', "Tch. Of course they've been suppressin' their power<br/>all this time.")
('Risette', "We'll need to use shards however we can to survive!<br/>Do whatever it takes to hold out!")
('Quatre', "I can barely keep up with what's happening...but let's<br/>do this, FIO! XEROS!")
('Quatre', "We can't allow these intruders to defile this sacred<br/>place a moment longer!")
('FIO', 'Understood! / RUFF!')
('Agnès', 'Ngh... Is everyone all right?!')
('Feri', 'That malaak is even more deadly than we thought...')
('Aaron', "Ugh... Pisses me off. You haven't been taking us<br/>seriously all this time, have you?!")
('Melchior', "Ahaha! Oh, I showed Beauty's Blade a little of what<br/>I'm capable of—just not you.")
('Olympia', 'Your strength is within my predicted parameters—<br/>including those orbal drones.')
('Van', "As if that doll wasn't bad enough. Now we've got<br/>those bomb artifacts to deal with, too.")
('Risette', "The Gardens' overseers are capable of even more than<br/>we feared, it would seem...")
('Quatre', "Ugh. If only I could make better use of FIO and<br/>XEROS' potential...")
('Melchior', "Heehee. You're just so much fun to play with that<br/>you've got me all worked up.")
('Melchior', "Ahh... I don't think I can resist the urge anymore.")
('Melchior', "I know they've got the boss curious, but surely there's<br/>no harm in slicing them open while he's not looking?")
('Olympia', 'I am not your boss and will not speak for him. Do as<br/>you please.')
('Aaron', 'Heh heh. Bring it, you son of a bitch!')
('Feri', 'The flames of the Kruga have only just begun to burn!')
('Agnès', 'Wha...?')

('Professor Callaghan', 'Where am I...?')
('Professor Callaghan', 'I see. So it was a success.')
('Quatre', '...?!')
('Risette', 'That sounds like...')
('Melchior', 'Well, would you look at that? It worked!')
('Melchior', "So how does it feel, Professor? What's it like living in<br/>the digital world?")
('Professor Callaghan', 'It is even more comfortable than I had imagined.')
('Professor Callaghan', "I'm frankly surprised by how comfortable it is...but I<br/>suppose it also makes complete logical sense.")
('Professor Callaghan', 'This is how it feels to be liberated of burdens<br/>and distractions. I can think more clearly than ever.')
('Professor Callaghan', 'The final stage of my work will be a breeze like this.<br/>Your expectations will be met!')
('Melchior', "Aww. That's my big professor! You will be...<br/>handsomely rewarded for your work. ❤")

('Van', "No way... Don't tell me...")
('Risette', 'His knowledge, personality, and memories have all<br/>been converted into an AI.')
('Risette', 'Most likely through the power of the Genesis.')
('Risette', 'All so that he could surpass the limitations of the<br/>human mind and become a singularity!')
('Agnès', '...')
('Quatre', 'Professor Callaghan, how could...?')
('Melchior', "Well, well. You're even more perceptive than<br/>I expected. What a vexatious little maid you are.")
('Olympia', 'Must you be like this every time, Melchior?')
('Olympia', 'Our work here is done. We have no reason to stay<br/>any longer.')

('Prince Sherid', "My only true wish is that you put a stop to Almata's<br/>plans before they can bear fruit. Does this<br/>sound doable?")
('Van', "We'll be well compensated for this, I trust?")
(500, 'After the conference...')
('Feri', 'Kasim...why?')
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', "It's been some time, Ferida.")
('Agnès', 'I suspected you two were related...')
('Aaron', "Your brother, right? Never expected him to be one of<br/>Marduk's hunting dogs.")
('Feri', '...')
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', "I hear you've been taking good care of my sister,<br/>Arkride Solutions.")
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', "As for you, Van...it's been two years, I believe?")
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', "I understand you've greatly improved your use of the<br/>stun caliber and your martial arts.")
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', 'Risette mentioned as much. As your former<br/>instructor, that fills me with great pride.')
('Van', 'I try. Still not so hot with the tactics stuff you taught<br/>me, though.')
('Van', "I've heard all kinds of stories about you, too, but I<br/>never expected our first meeting to be like this.")
('General Manager Thorndyke', 'Heh. In that we are agreed.')
('General Manager Thorndyke', 'Still, while we might be providing our services and<br/>your weapon, I believe the contract between us to be<br/>an equal one.')
('General Manager Thorndyke', 'I hope that we can continue our fine partnership,<br/>Mr. Arkride.')
('Van', "Yeah, let's not get too friendly. I'm not interested in<br/>becomin' any more than just a contractor to you.")
('Van', "Still, since we're here, there is one thing I wanna ask.")
('Van', 'Just how long has she been like that?')
('Agnès', '...')
('General Manager Thorndyke', "Information on our concierge is classified, I'm afraid.")
('General Manager Thorndyke', 'However, if an approximate timeframe will suffice, I<br/>suppose I can oblige: about a year ago.')
('Van', "Something's seemed off about her all this time.")
('Van', "We first started talkin' three years ago, but the first<br/>time we actually met was just in Tharbad.")
('Van', 'Even when I visited Ored for lessons on tactics, she<br/>was conveniently unavailable.')
('Feri', '(That sounds like...)')
('Agnès', '(Does that mean...?)')
('General Manager Thorndyke', "Still, I know she's in good hands with Associate<br/>Professor Archette.")
('General Manager Thorndyke', 'I also happened to bring some compatible parts that<br/>she can use.')
('General Manager Thorndyke', 'Though I regret that Ms. Twinings will not be able to<br/>provide you with any more of her services for the<br/>time being.')
('Van', "You ain't got nothin' to apologize for.")
('Van', "I doubt any amount of workers' comp I could give her<br/>would make up for forcing her to do somethin'<br/>that crazy...")
('Van', "...but either way, that's my problem to deal with,<br/>not yours.")
('General Manager Thorndyke', 'Well, I apologize for meddling in your affairs, then.')
('General Manager Thorndyke', "With that said, we must take our leave.<br/>We've negotiations with the Republican Army to<br/>attend to.")
('General Manager Thorndyke', "As I mentioned during the conference, we've no<br/>intention of interfering in this crisis any more than<br/>is necessary.")
('General Manager Thorndyke', '...Fascinated though I am by what a genius can<br/>achieve through an obsession that knows no bounds.')
('Feri', 'K-Kasim, wait!')
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', 'There are a number of matters Abi and I disagree on.')
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', 'Whether you are suited to being a warrior is very<br/>much one of them.')
('Feri', '...?!')
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', 'Still, I can only assume it was the guidance of the<br/>flames and Arusha that led you here.')
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', 'Battle is almost upon us—and I will be watching to<br/>see how you fare through it.')
('Feri', '...')
('Agnès', 'Feri...')
('Aaron', "As much as I'd love to write him off as an arrogant<br/>asshole, I can't get enough of a read on him.")
('Aaron', 'Just how tough is he?')
('Van', "I'd say he's one of the strongest jaegers who<br/>ever lived.")
('Renne', 'Your conversation is over, then?')
('Agnès', 'Renne! Where are the others?')
('Renne', "They're still here. There was talk of them returning to<br/>the capital, but that's not going to be possible now<br/>with the whole area on lockdown.")
('Renne', 'The roads, the railways...even the airspace around<br/>Edith is sectioned off. Not like that comes as any<br/>surprise after what happened.')
('Agnès', 'What do you mean?')
('Van', 'What happened now?')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', 'There was an explosion in Anchorville City.')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', 'There were no casualties, fortunately, but we suspect<br/>that Almata might have been involved.')
('Feri', '...?!')
('Aaron', "Anchorville's a decent-sized city north of the<br/>capital, right?")
('Van', "Yeah. That must've been just a diversion, while this is<br/>their real target.")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "Oh, I think that's almost certain. However, given its<br/>proximity to the capital, we can't afford to take<br/>it lightly.")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "Both the CID and the guild are being pushed to their<br/>limits right now. We won't be able to give you<br/>any backup.")
('Van', "That's fine. We weren't expectin' any to begin with.")
('Van', 'But you can at least share whatever info you manage<br/>to gather, surely? That goes for stuff from ZCF and<br/>the foundation, too.')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', 'That sounds fair to me—insofar as our interests align,<br/>of course.')
('Renne', "I'll also do what I can. Just take care of Agnès for me<br/>in return, please.")
('Agnès', 'Thank you, Renne.')
('Renne', 'I hear the initial work is done on your concierge, too.')
('Renne', "That's Professor Hamilton's family for you.<br/>Geniuses to the last.")
('Agnès', 'Oh!')
('Van', "Thanks for tellin' us.")
('Feri', "That's so good to hear...")
('Agnès', "She was being seen to in Associate Professor<br/>Esmeray's room, wasn't she?")
('Aaron', "Let's go say hi, then.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'Oh! Hellooo there.')
('Quatre', 'I hope everything went well.')
('Van', 'Thanks. Sounds like you pulled an all-nighter, huh?')
('Feri', 'Looks like XEROS is up and running again.')
('XEROS', 'RUFF.')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "Mm-hmm. Fortunately for us, the damage for him<br/>wasn't so bad.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'I just wish I could say the same about Risette.<br/>Putting her back to the way she was is going to take<br/>a while...')
('Quatre', '...')
('Risette', "Please, don't be so downhearted.")
('Risette', "The first-rate care you've been giving me has<br/>stabilized my vitals a considerable amount.")
('Quatre', '...')
('Agnès', "...I'm relieved to hear that.")
('Risette', 'Have you spoken to Mr. Thorndyke?')
('Van', "Did before comin' here, yeah. He's as much of a<br/>questionable character as I was expecting.")
('Van', "Their chief of security's the same ol' standoffish<br/>grump, too. You'd think it'd kill him to put on<br/>a smile.")
('Risette', "Haha... That's just how they are, I'm afraid...")
('Feri', '...')
('Aaron', "It's fine, you know. You don't need to force yourself<br/>to speak.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "Umm... For what it's worth, her life isn't in any<br/>danger here.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'The medicine you helped me with yesterday seems to<br/>have been working wonders.')
('Risette', "She's right. It has really made this easier for me.")
('Van', "Good to hear. We sure didn't think it'd end up bein'<br/>used on you when we took that job on.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'The artificial limbs that Mr. Thorndyke brought with<br/>him are compatible with her, too.')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "That's not to say you shouldn't take it easy.<br/>Anything that involves the nervous system is a heavy<br/>burden on the body.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'The best thing you can do for yourself right now is<br/>get looots and looots of rest.')
('Risette', 'I will... Thank you.')
('Risette', 'Though I truly am sorry for not being able to support<br/>you all when you need it most.')
('Van', "Don't sweat it. We can take things from here—you<br/>just kick back and relax.")
('Van', "Next time you wake up, you can bet we'll have good<br/>news to share—and a hell of a big bonus, too.")
('Risette', "Heehee. I'll have to look forward to that, then, won't<br/>I...? Follow your hearts and act as you always do, and<br/>everything will be fine...")
('Quatre', "...S-Sorry, but I'd like to ask you something!")
('Quatre', 'Why? Why did you risk your life to save mine?')
('Quatre', 'No one should have to put themselves through<br/>something like this over someone like me!')
('Risette', 'Haha... It was because you were just so...dazzlingly<br/>radiant in that moment, I suppose.')
('Quatre', '...What?')
('Risette', 'You have so many people who care about you—and<br/>you care about them just as much in return.')
('Risette', "To someone who's lost her bonds, memories, and<br/>even body, the sight was almost blinding.")
('Risette', "I'm a little jealous of all you have, if I'm to tell<br/>the truth...")
('Risette', 'So please, treat yourself like an irreplaceable treasure.')
('Risette', 'Not just for you, but for those who love you, too...')
('Feri', 'Umm... About Risette...')
('Aaron', 'Just how much of her is artificial, anyways?')
('Van', "I don't know for sure, but my guess is 'a lot.'")
('Van', "You were indirectly involved in makin' her who she is,<br/>too, right?")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "That's right. We assisted Marduk in researching<br/>artificial biological limbs some time ago.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'Our partnership only produced a prototype, though.<br/>I never imagined they would actually start using that<br/>technology like this.')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'Risette was clearly the result of multiple different<br/>technologies being used together—not just the one<br/>they developed with us.')
('Agnès', "I've heard this is also a field that the Institute of<br/>Technology over in the Empire has been<br/>looking into.")
('Agnès', "Umm, Van... You seem like you've known the truth<br/>for a while.")
('Van', "I couldn't be sure, but I had a feelin'.")
('Van', "I could tell the image I was seein' during our video<br/>calls was artificially generated.")
('Van', 'So it took me really off guard when she just showed<br/>up in person in Tharbad.')
('Van', "It was only when I noticed that she moved faster and<br/>kinda different from normal people that I started<br/>puttin' two and two together.")
('Aaron', 'Makes sense.')
('Feri', 'I did feel like there was something strange about her,<br/>but I never would have imagined it was because<br/>of this.')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "She's capable of far greater power and speed than an<br/>ordinary human, but she also has less precise control<br/>over her body in exchange.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "I can't imagine just how much effort she must've put<br/>in to be able to move as naturally as she does.")
('Quatre', '...')
('Feri', "...She'll be able to return to the way she was,<br/>won't she?")
('Agnès', "I'm sure she will... Right, Professor?")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "I think there's every chance of that. The technology<br/>involved seems to be fairly well established by<br/>Marduk at this point.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "It won't be easy to make all the precise adjustments<br/>after reattaching her limbs, but I'll make sure<br/>it happens.")
('Van', "We're countin' on ya. She might be on loan to us<br/>from Marduk, but she's as much a member of Arkride<br/>Solutions as the rest of us.")
('Van', 'Anyway, time for us to get outta here.')
('Agnès', 'Right. We need to do what we can—and put Risette<br/>at ease.')
('Quatre', 'Wait! Please.')
('Quatre', "If it's not too much to ask, could I keep helping you?")
('Quatre', "I want to stop Professor Callaghan and the devils<br/>who've done this to him by my own hand—no matter<br/>what it takes.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'Quatre...')
('Van', 'Sorry, but no can do.')
('Quatre', "...I suppose that's the right decision after I landed<br/>Risette in a hospital bed.")
('Quatre', "I wasn't able to use FIO and XEROS at even half of<br/>their potential, either.")
('Quatre', "If all I'm going to be is a burden to the team—")
('Van', "That ain't what I'm sayin'.")
('Van', "You're no burden. We're gonna need you and your<br/>engineering knowhow here for sure.")
('Van', "But we're also not a charity. We only do favors for<br/>people if the client and price are a good fit.")
('Van', 'You heard what Risette said, right?')
('Van', 'If you did, then you should know what you gotta do,<br/>and where you went wrong.')
('Quatre', '...!')
('Aaron', 'Heh.')
('Quatre', "You're right. I should never have done something that<br/>would upset the people who care about me—and I<br/>never will again.")
('Quatre', 'I just want to stop the chaos unfolding in Basel and<br/>the misuse of technology that created it...')
('Quatre', "...and if I'm gonna do that, it's not the help of the<br/>police or guild I need—it's you.")
('Quatre', 'As compensation, I can offer you my skills and<br/>expertise on technology.')
('Quatre', "I can also give you my word that I'll help Essy put<br/>Risette back to the way she was as fast as possible.")
('Quatre', "...Is that enough to make me a 'good fit' for you?")
('Van', "It sure is. We'd be happy to take that 4SPG on.")
('Van', "We'll be countin' on you, now. Couldn't ask for better<br/>than a student of Professor Hamilton's.")
('Quatre', "Thank you! I won't let you down!")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "Promise me you'll take goooood care of him, okay?<br/>I'll be working 'round the clock, too!")
('Agnès', 'Promise. Thank you so much!')
('Feri', 'Time to get down to business!')
('Van', "The CID's Special Ops unit is gonna be here<br/>this evening. That means we've only got half a day<br/>left to do what we want.")
('Van', "Once they're here, we're done. We gotta make this<br/>time count.")
('Aaron', "Sure felt to me like Almata's work was done after<br/>making that AI a success.")
('Aaron', "You sure they didn't just bounce?")
('Quatre', "No. I'm certain they're still in the region.")
('Quatre', "The abnormalities in the orbal net and distribution<br/>network are less pronounced than yesterday, but<br/>they're still present.")
('Quatre', "Something's still happening—I'm sure of it.")
('Feri', 'R-Really?!')
('Agnès', "Then Almata's research is still going on somewhere in<br/>the city?")
('Quatre', '...Risette mentioned something earlier that I think<br/>will help me.')
('Risette', 'This might be fundamentally different to what<br/>happened in Crossbell, but I still think that is our<br/>closest reference point.')
('Risette', 'The orbal network and septium veins were used in<br/>the development of highly advanced technology then<br/>as well.')
('Risette', 'Basel City also has both, making it the perfect<br/>environment to finish what they started.')
('Quatre', 'With the orbal network and the septium veins at their<br/>disposal, they have access to effectively unlimited<br/>resources for their research.')
('Quatre', 'If Professor Callaghan has reached the heights that<br/>the singularity in Crossbell did...')
('Van', "...then our foes are probably lurkin' somewhere in the<br/>region finishin' what they started.")
('Agnès', "That's still a very large area to try and find them<br/>in, though... We'll have to find some way to narrow<br/>our search down.")
('Agnès', "If we could get close enough to their location, the<br/>Genesis might react and show us we're on the right<br/>track, too.")
('Aaron', 'Using the damn thing like a metal detector, huh?<br/>Suppose we gotta try anything we can at this point.')
('Feri', "Let's see if there are any more 4SPGs to take care of<br/>while we start asking around!")
('Quatre', "There's no telling where we might find a clue that'll<br/>lead us to the truth. I'll help however I ca—")
('Quatre', "Er... Wait. Should I not be meddling in your other<br/>jobs now that I'm a client instead of a guide?")
('Van', "Don't be silly. You're one of us now.")
('Van', 'You are our client, but how about we just treat you<br/>more like a temp for now?')
('Quatre', 'Oh... Okay! That works for me!')
('Feri', 'Heehee...')
('Agnès', "We're happy to have you with us!")
('Aaron', "Even if it means the kid-to-adult ratio's evened<br/>out here.")
('Van', "Well, then, let's get to work.")
('Van', "I wanna stop by the guild, Verne,<br/>Giscard's workshop... Should probably talk to our<br/>resident genius professor, too.")
('Quatre', 'Those sound like good places to start to me.')
('Professor Hamilton', "So you're Lilia's granddaughter.")
('Professor Hamilton', 'You do resemble her—not just the way you look.<br/>I can see you also possess her kindness and<br/>strong spirit.')
('Agnès', "...This is one of my great-grandfather's diaries.")
('Professor Hamilton', 'This brings me back... I would catch him writing<br/>entries from time to time.')
('Professor Hamilton', 'Oh, this here—this one is about me, Gerhard,<br/>and Albert...')
('Professor Hamilton', 'Haha. I still remember that time like it was yesterday.')
('Chief Engineer Giscard', 'I only met him once back when I was a youngster...<br/>Makes me nostalgic thinking back on it now.')
('Renne', "I don't mean to interrupt your reminiscing, but those<br/>words toward the end are rather ominous.")
('Renne', 'I can see why it inspired you to risk so much to collect<br/>the Geneses.')
('Agnès', 'Yes...')
('Quatre', "'Else all that we know will come to an end...'")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "I can't imagine it's meant to be taken any way other<br/>than literally—especially when you consider how the<br/>Geneses have been used so far...")
('Aaron', "Yeah. The kinda shit they're capable of almost feels<br/>like a bad joke sometimes.")
('Agnès', "So far, we've managed to gather five of the<br/>Eight Geneses.")
('Agnès', 'But do you think it would be better if I left them in<br/>the hands of you and the other disciples?')
('Feri', 'Agnès...')
('Van', '...')
('Professor Hamilton', 'No. I think they are too much for even us to handle.')
('Professor Hamilton', 'If they truly are experimental apparatuses that<br/>Professor Epstein somehow created to gauge<br/>the world...')
('Professor Hamilton', "...then—and this will sound rather unscientific of<br/>me—it's as if destiny willed them to be in your hands.")
('Professor Hamilton', "I plan to stay in Calvard for a while, so I'll get in<br/>contact with Albert and Gerhard about this.")
('Professor Hamilton', 'Fortunately, we happen to have someone else who<br/>knows both of them right here with us.')
('Renne', "I'd be happy to serve as a mediator between<br/>all parties. We have much to discuss about the West<br/>Zemuria Tech Union as well.")
('Professor Hamilton', 'I will also do what I can to help Risette.')
('Professor Hamilton', "Is everything still in order with regards to attaching<br/>Risette's new parts, Esmeray?")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "As in order as can be! Our prospects were already<br/>bright with her being such a capable engineer, but<br/>with you, they'll be eeeven brighter.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Me and the other artisans'll be happy to pitch in with<br/>any precise adjustments, too. We'll see they aren't<br/>even a milirege off.")
('Quatre', "And I'll help, too, of course!")
('Feri', "I don't think we have anything to worry about with<br/>this many people on the case!")
('Agnès', 'Yes! It really is wonderful to see...')
('Van', "Well, can't say I give a damn about Marduk at the<br/>end of the day.")
('Van', "Risette's a different story, though. She's one of the<br/>team—so take good care of her, if you don't mind.")
('Professor Hamilton', "I don't mind one bit.")
('Professor Hamilton', 'You said your name was Van, I believe? This may be<br/>a strange favor to ask...')
('Professor Hamilton', "...but I'd like you to look after my teacher's<br/>dear descendant. It would mean the world to me.")
('Professor Hamilton', "And if you could please look after her young<br/>friends—but you were planning to do that even if I<br/>didn't ask, weren't you?")
('Van', '...Heh. You got me.')
('Van', "I'll do what I can to meet my obligation as their<br/>employer, at the very least.")
('Agnès', 'Van...')
('Feri', 'Heehee.')
('Aaron', 'Eh, we save his ass way more than he saves ours.')
('Professor Hamilton', 'Is something wrong, Quatre?')
('Quatre', "It's just...")
('Quatre', "I'm so happy you're back. I am. But...")
('Quatre', "But I wasn't able to do a thing in your absence. I feel<br/>like such a failure.")
('Professor Hamilton', 'Quatre...')
('Van', "You been sleepwalking these past few days<br/>or somethin'?")
('Van', "We couldn't've dreamed of dealing with this whole<br/>mess without you. You were our guide through<br/>and through.")
('Quatre', '...!')
('Agnès', 'We never would have thought to go to that factory<br/>without you, and I doubt we could have gotten<br/>through to Professor Callaghan, either.')
('Agnès', 'We owe everything to your efforts and perseverance.')
('Feri', 'Plus your orbal drones were a huge help.')
('Aaron', "You weren't too bad for someone who still looks and<br/>thinks like a kid.")
('Aaron', 'So, you know, good job on this one, or whatever.')
('Van', "Why d'you always gotta be so far up your own ass?")
('Quatre', '...')
('Chief Engineer Giscard', 'Heh.')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'Haha...')
('Renne', 'See now? Not just anyone can be blessed with so<br/>many in their corner, you know.')
('Professor Hamilton', 'Thank you. For all you have done in my absence.')
('Professor Hamilton', "It's good to be home. I've missed you, Quatre.")
('Quatre', "Yeah...but not half as much as I've missed you, Gran!")
('Quatre', '...?!')
('Researcher Nadir', 'Oh! I remember seeing you yesterday.')
('Researcher Nadir', 'Were you looking to speak with Professor Cronkite?<br/>He just left, sorry.')
('Agnès', 'Shoot, we just missed him...')
('Quatre', 'He does seem to be spending a lot of time outside his<br/>lab lately...')
('Quatre', "You wouldn't happen to know where he went,<br/>would you?")
('Van', "We're lookin' into Callaghan's disappearance. We<br/>thought he might know a thing or two about the guy.")
('Researcher Nadir', "I'm not sure where he went, I'm afraid. If I had to<br/>guess, though, I think he's taking a quick break<br/>right now.")
('Researcher Nadir', "There's this café he's taken to visiting lately.<br/>He usually heads out for a pick-me-up around<br/>this time.")
('Aaron', 'Oh? Where is it?')
('Researcher Nadir', "Well, that's the million mira question. The owner,<br/>Willy, roams around town all throughout the day.")
('Researcher Nadir', 'The café is never in one place for long. He just packs<br/>up and goes wherever his heart guides him.')
('Researcher Nadir', 'The professor has his pattern down to a<br/>science, though. I have no idea how he does it.')
('Van', "Oh, that's the place we visited yesterday. I do<br/>remember the guy sayin' some professor type stopped<br/>by a lot.")
('Quatre', "Neither Essy nor I can make sense of the café's<br/>movements either.")
('Van', "Well, process of elimination it is, then. Let's start<br/>with where we saw it last.")
('Van', "Maybe we'll run into somebody who saw him pack<br/>up—and then we just follow the trail from there.")
('Van', 'It was in the Artisanal District last night.')
('Van', 'Doubt he went anywhere else that night given how<br/>late it was, so that can be our starting point.')
('Researcher Nadir', 'I heard from some students that he was over by the<br/>church in the Artisanal District last night.')
('Researcher Nadir', "It sounded like it was late enough that he would've<br/>called it a night instead of packing up and heading<br/>somewhere else.")
('Risette', 'We have a lead, then. We should ask if anyone in the<br/>area saw the café the following day.')
('Van', "Yeah. Let's head on over to the church and see<br/>what's up.")
('Quatre', "I wasn't expecting Essy to have a request for us.")
('Quatre', "Though really, she could've just told us in person...")
('Van', "Heh heh. Guessin' she just heard this is how we do<br/>things and rolled with it.")
('Van', "We'll have to go talk to her later.")
('Agnès', 'Agreed. We really owe it to her.')
('Kei', "A professor abusing their authority, you say...?<br/>That's a bit of a stretch to me, not gonna lie.")
('Kei', "I can say for certain that Professor Cronkite and<br/>Professor Tain would never do that! It can't be them.")
('Aaron', 'Oh? What makes you so sure of that?')
('Kei', "Well... So, Professor Cronkite's a man of few words,<br/>so he can come across as kinda scary...")
('Kei', "...but he means well, really! I mean, he's one of the<br/>greatest minds of our time—he lives and<br/>breathes science.")
('Kei', "And then, Professor Tain is just really friendly<br/>to everybody. He's always looking out for people.")
('Kei', "He's known the world over for his work in civil<br/>engineering and urban planning.")
('Risette', 'The Basel Institute of Science certainly earns<br/>its reputation.')
('Risette', 'Its faculty are all accomplished scientists and<br/>engineers in their own right.')
('Kei', 'Yup! Lotsa famous people come to study and<br/>lecture here.')
('Kei', "Professor Callaghan's a real celebrity, too.")
('Kei', "He's a real whiz when it comes to mechanical<br/>engineering. He's the brain behind the military's<br/>new weapons.")
('Kei', "Last I heard, though, his new big proposal got shot<br/>down in favor of someone else's.")
('Kei', "He didn't really take that very well...")
('Kei', "But he's bounced back, from what I can tell.<br/>He's really putting his all into his new project!")
('Kei', "I'm really humbled to get to work with so many<br/>hard-working and talented people.")
('Aaron', "'Hard-working and talented' people can still<br/>be assholes. Are they good PEOPLE, is what<br/>we're asking?")
('Agnès', 'Could you maybe have phrased that a little less<br/>aggressively...?')
('Van', "Well, thanks for takin' the time to talk to us.<br/>You were a big help.")
('Van', "All right. I think we've combed this area over pretty<br/>well now.")
('Van', "Let's go sit down somewhere and try piecin'<br/>things together.")
('Risette', 'I recommend that open space at the front of the<br/>institute grounds.')
('Risette', 'I saw some benches there that we could use.')
('Aaron', 'Sounds like a plan to me.')
('Librarian Venter', 'Huh? A power-tripping professor, you say? Hmm...')
('Librarian Venter', "Well, if it were anybody, I'd put my money<br/>on Cronkite.")
('Librarian Venter', "He's awfully quick to dismiss people. Haughty, in<br/>a word.")
('Librarian Venter', "'Kind' and 'helpful' aren't exactly synonymous<br/>with him...at least, from what I've seen<br/>and heard.")
('Risette', 'I see.')
('Risette', 'Have you heard anything about any of the other<br/>professors that might relate to these allegations?')
('Librarian Venter', 'Let me think now...')
('Librarian Venter', "Well, I can't see Professor Aurelie doing anything<br/>like that. She's just a bundle of sunshine—not a mean<br/>bone in her body.")
('Librarian Venter', 'Sometimes I even see her in here picking up research<br/>materials for her students.')
('Librarian Venter', "Then there's Professor Callaghan... He always made a<br/>point of helping out his assistants.")
('Librarian Venter', "He's certainly not a bad person in my view, but he's<br/>gotten a bit of a bad rap after his work went south.")
('Risette', 'Thank you for sharing your experience with us.<br/>We greatly appreciate it.')
('Van', "All right. I think we've combed this area over pretty<br/>well now.")
('Van', "Let's go sit down somewhere and try piecin'<br/>things together.")
('Risette', 'I recommend that open space at the front of the<br/>institute grounds.')
('Risette', 'I saw some benches there that we could use.')
('Aaron', 'Sounds like a plan to me.')
('Researcher Nadir', 'Workplace harassment? Goodness...')
('Researcher Nadir', "I've heard these bits and pieces, but I'm just... I'm a<br/>bit nervous to talk about it.")
('Agnès', "We won't tell anyone, don't worry. Anything helps.")
('Researcher Nadir', "I've heard loud shouting from one of the other<br/>labs, yes. It stunned me out of the work I was doing.")
('Researcher Nadir', "I heard stuff like... 'You idiots! Can't you do<br/>ANYTHING right?!' and, 'You're a disgrace to<br/>the institute! Get out!'")
('Researcher Nadir', "He's just lashing out at everything and<br/>everyone now. It's really disturbing...")
('Feri', 'Which professor was the one doing that?')
('Researcher Nadir', "Er... I just can't say it, sorry. If... If THEY find out it<br/>was me, I'd have hell to pay!")
('Researcher Nadir', "It's really gnawing at me. The abuse is only getting<br/>worse and worse, from what I'm told...")
('Researcher Nadir', "I've heard the works: fatigue, depression, exhaustion,<br/>even a couple researchers fainting on the job.")
('Researcher Nadir', 'That whole department looks visibly shaken<br/>these days—the stress is just too much for them.')
('Researcher Nadir', "I worry they'll all end up like Cindy...")
('Van', 'Cindy? What happened to her?')
('Researcher Nadir', "She's...at her breaking point, from what I hear.<br/>I hardly see her at the institute anymore.")
('Researcher Nadir', "We've all been trying to support her however we can,<br/>but...it's rough. It really is.")
('Aaron', "Damn. Yeah, that's not good. Who's the professor<br/>helping her, out of curiosity?")
('Researcher Nadir', "That would be Professor Esmeray. She's in the<br/>bioengineering department.")
('Researcher Nadir', "She's known the world over for her<br/>cutting-edge research. A real upstanding woman.")
('Researcher Nadir', "She's always up to her neck in her own work,<br/>though—she probably doesn't know the extent of the<br/>abuse at the other labs.")
('Van', "Yeah... Thanks for fillin' us in. This still helps us<br/>a lot.")
('Van', "All right. I think we've combed this area over pretty<br/>well now.")
('Van', "Let's go sit down somewhere and try piecin'<br/>things together.")
('Risette', 'I recommend that open space at the front of the<br/>institute grounds.')
('Risette', 'I saw some benches there that we could use.')
('Aaron', 'Sounds like a plan to me.')
('Van', "All right. We about ready to sit down and<br/>get crackin'?")
('Van', 'Well, that was pretty good. We got our hands on<br/>some nice info there.')
('Feri', "We learned a lot of professors' names, too!")
('Risette', "There's Professor Callaghan, the engineering science<br/>authority, Professor Aurelie in the<br/>chemistry department...")
('Risette', 'Professor Cronkite, a well-respected expert in physics<br/>and orbal engineering, and Professor Tain, an<br/>architectural researcher.')
('Aaron', 'And then one Professor Esmeray, over in bio.')
('Aaron', "They all sounded really capable, but of course, the stat<br/>sheets don't tell the whole story. They all sounded<br/>like oddballs in their own right.")
('Aaron', 'I think we can pretty safely narrow the perp down to<br/>one of those five.')
('Agnès', 'I agree. We have pretty strong evidence to<br/>suggest that.')
('Van', "All right. Let's take our evidence from the top, then.")
('Van', 'All the people we talked to, all the testimonies, they<br/>all had this one thing in common.')
('Risette', 'Ah... I see what you mean.')
('Van', "(Nah... It wasn't that they were tryin' to brush it off.<br/>They were pretty blunt about it.)")
('Van', "(It's that they didn't name the culprit. Some of 'em<br/>knew who it was, but they kept their mouths shut.)")
('Van', '(Nah, threats or blackmail never came up. They were<br/>pretty forthcoming about what happened...)')
('Van', '(...which makes it all the weirder that nobody<br/>mentioned the suspect by name.)')
('Van', "Not a single one named the culprit. Some of those<br/>guys knew who it was, but it kept soundin' like they<br/>were too scared to name 'em.")
('Van', "Would've made our job a hell of a lot easier if they<br/>just named the guy, but nope.")
('Feri', 'Yeah, now that you mention it, that IS kinda weird.')
('Feri', 'I can understand not wanting to be labeled a snitch...')
('Feri', '...but it felt like there was more to it than that.')
('Agnès', "They were afraid of the culprit, but you could tell they<br/>respected them, too—they didn't want to sully this<br/>professor's good name.")
('Aaron', "And some people said the guy wasn't always like that.<br/>Something changed them.")
('Aaron', 'Probably the conflict over that proposal we<br/>heard about. Something about hard feelings.')
('Aaron', 'That one guy said they had to crunch after the<br/>proposal fell through. Telltale sign of abuse to me.')
('Risette', "That does seem likely—though we can't say for<br/>certain what changed the professor's behavior, that<br/>would be a reasonable explanation.")
('Risette', 'That said, no circumstance justifies such an abuse of<br/>power and status. This professor is truly incorrigible.')
('Feri', "So, that's who you think the culprit is?")
('Van', "Yeah. You ask me, there's only one professor who fits<br/>the bill...")
('Van', "(Yeah, no, it can't be Aurelie. Nobody had anything<br/>bad to say about her.)")
('Van', "(It's gotta be somebody else.)")
('Van', "(Cronkite is... Nah, he's not our guy.)")
('Van', "(People said he was abrasive, but not<br/>actually malicious. He doesn't strike me as<br/>the abuser.)")
('Van', "(Nah, pretty sure it ain't Tain. He didn't really<br/>stand out.)")
('Van', "(It's gotta be somebody else.)")
('Van', "(Esmeray... No. Everybody was sayin' she was cool.)")
('Van', "(It's gotta be somebody else.)")
('Van', "Professor Callaghan's our guy.")
('Agnès', "He's one of the foremost authorities on engineering<br/>science—perhaps the smartest man in the whole field.")
('Agnès', "I've seen him in the papers plenty of times before.")
('Agnès', "He's always described as a savant—notably, he helped<br/>modernize the military's weapons and equipment.")
('Van', "But he's got revenge on the mind, sounds like.<br/>Some other professor one-upped him, and that's got<br/>him pissed.")
('Van', "I get it sucks, but you'd think a world-renowned<br/>scientist would be less...childish about it.")
('Aaron', "You'd know a thing or two about acting like a child,<br/>wouldn't you?")
('Van', 'I dunno, you usually call me a grandpa. Which is<br/>it, bud?')
('Risette', 'Is now the time?')
('Feri', 'So...what do we do now?')
('Feri', 'We have all the recordings of the people we talked to.')
('Feri', 'That all points to Professor Callaghan being<br/>the suspect.')
('Aaron', "So what's our next move?")
('Aaron', 'Do we hunt down our client next and give them<br/>the tapes?')
('Van', "Nah. I'm thinkin' we get Professor Callaghan's<br/>opinion on it without accusin' him directly.")
('Van', 'We nudge him in the right direction and he might<br/>just turn himself in.')
('Agnès', 'What do you mean?')
('Van', "Simple: we tell him about these abuse rumors goin'<br/>around, we talk about all these exhausted students,<br/>and he connects the dots on his own.")
('Van', "Failing that? Well, we already know it's him.")
('Van', "He's bound to figure out his reputation's on the line,<br/>the more he hears about this. If he's smart, he'll<br/>fess up.")
('Van', "So that's what we do: we give him a subtle li'l nudge,<br/>and he does all the work Elsaim wanted for us.<br/>Two birds with one stone right there.")
('Feri', "That sounds really...scheming. I'm not so sure we're<br/>the good guys all of a sudden...")
('Agnès', 'Well, haha...')
('Risette', 'It is a quintessentially spriggan-like way of solving<br/>our problem.')
('Aaron', "Fine by me. To the power-tripper's lab, then?")
('Aaron', "...Actually, where is it? I don't remember seeing it<br/>while we were taking our tour.")
('Risette', "I suspect it's in the special research building.<br/>We'd need some form of clearance to enter, of course.")
('Risette', "We passed by a door with a guard in front earlier.<br/>They won't let any ordinary civilian inside.")
('Risette', 'I suspect we would need an A-rank card, at the<br/>very least.')
('Feri', 'It was hard enough for us to get a C-rank card.<br/>I think getting an A-rank one is off the table...')
('Feri', 'What should we do, then? Maybe wait for him to<br/>leave the building and ambush him?')
('Van', "Nah. Ol' Van's the man with a plan.")
('Van', "All that matters is that we get inside the building—<br/>doesn't matter HOW we do it.")
('Van', "And bein' a spriggan, I've got a few tricks up<br/>my sleeve.")
('Agnès', "Umm, Van? You're kinda scaring me with that<br/>smile there...")
('Risette', "Heehee... We defer to you. What's your strategy,<br/>master spriggan?")
('Van', 'So first, we just roll on up to the building like<br/>anybody else would.')
('Van', "Once we get there, we convince the guard to let us in.<br/>Just act naturally and we're golden.")
('Van', 'Excuse me. Is this where we can find<br/>Professor Callaghan?')
('Van', "We're here to speak with him.")
('Security Guard', 'Right, yes. May I see your card, sir?')
('Van', 'Of course.')
('System', 'Van handed over his certification card.')
('Security Guard', "C-rank... I'm sorry, but I can't let you in without the<br/>proper security clearance.")
('Security Guard', "If you don't mind me asking, what business do you<br/>have with him to begin with?")
('Van', "Glad you asked. We're here on behalf of the<br/>Principality of Elsaim.")
('Van', "We figured there was an appointment for us, but we<br/>just now found out they didn't set anything up.<br/>Sorry for the inconvenience.")
('Van', "We wanted to inquire about Professor Callaghan's<br/>new research—it's caught our investors' interest.")
('Van', 'His findings have seismic implications—even the<br/>Xipha revolution would be small potatoes compared<br/>to this.')
('Van', 'So we looked into meeting with him and<br/>collaborating on his research...')
('Van', "...only to learn that Marduk was interested in the<br/>same thing. So now we've got ourselves a three-way<br/>partnership here.")
('Risette', "I am here on the Marduk Company's behalf—I'm a<br/>concierge in their employ.")
('Security Guard', "So...you're meeting with him to discuss a grant, is<br/>that right?")
('Security Guard', "I'm a bit surprised to hear both Elsaim and Marduk<br/>are collaborating on this, but, well...stranger things<br/>have happened, I guess.")
('Security Guard', 'I apologize for the inconvenience.')
('Security Guard', "That said, erm...who are these children with you?<br/>Surely they're not employees.")
('Agnès', 'Umm... Pardon?')
('Feri', "I-I'm not a kid, I'm just short!")
('Van', "Ahem. They're associates of an Elsaim VIP,<br/>pardon them.")
('Van', "They're here on Elsaim's behalf as well, so they were<br/>looking to sit in on our meeting.")
('Van', 'This is a little awkward, though. We came all the way<br/>from Elsaim just to get turned away at the door on<br/>a technicality.')
('Van', "I'm not sure what to tell them when we get<br/>back home...")
('Security Guard', "I really am sorry. There's clearly been some kind of a<br/>mix up here.")
('Security Guard', 'Your arrangement might have been lost in the shuffle<br/>with all the Aramis students visiting.')
('Security Guard', 'You must have been issued the same rank card as<br/>them by mistake.')
('Security Guard', "I'll go clear this up with Professor Callaghan.<br/>One minute, please...")
('Van', "Of course. We'll be waiting.")
('Aaron', "(You sure you're okay with him calling your bluff?)")
('Van', "(Of course. Who's he to turn down grant money?<br/>That ain't what we're REALLY here for, but he just<br/>has to take the bait.)")
('Security Guard', 'Thank you for your patience.')
('Security Guard', 'The professor would like to meet with you at once.<br/>Go right in.')
('Van', 'Thank you very much.')
('Professor Aurelie', "I thought you would want to take some more<br/>time off... You still look awfully tired. Are you sure<br/>you're all right?")
('Researcher Cindy', "I just don't want to cause everybody more trouble<br/>than I already have.")
('Researcher Cindy', 'I never expected Professor Callaghan to just disappear<br/>like that, either...')
('Professor Aurelie', 'Nor did I... I was just as shocked when I learned of it<br/>this morning. The police are investigating as<br/>we speak.')
('Researcher Cindy', 'It has to have been a kidnapping. He would never just<br/>vanish and leave his research on the table like that.')
('Researcher Cindy', "I just can't believe it. I didn't want this... I hate what<br/>he did to me, but I never wanted it to end up like<br/>this...!")
('Professor Aurelie', 'Cindy...')
('Van', "Hey there. Sorry to intrude, but you're Cindy, then?")
('Professor Aurelie', "Oh, are you...? Right, you're the spriggan<br/>investigating his disappearance. Now I remember.")
('Researcher Cindy', "Mhm... That's me, yeah. Do you need something<br/>from me?")
('Van', "We wanted to talk to you about a job we were<br/>workin' on. Can we talk in private for a sec?")
('Van', "So, your name was comin' up a lot when we were<br/>lookin' into these harassment allegations here at<br/>the institute.")
('Van', 'We got an anonymous tip to kick this whole thing<br/>off, so I just wanted to ask: were you<br/>the whistleblower?')
('Researcher Cindy', "Umm... I'm sorry, but no.")
('Feri', "Wait, it wasn't you?")
('Researcher Cindy', "Definitely not. This is the first time I've even heard<br/>about you.")
('Researcher Cindy', 'But...I admit, he was really starting to wear me down.')
('Researcher Cindy', 'I started feeling like I should just leave the<br/>institute entirely... Sometimes I wanted his research<br/>to crash and burn.')
('Researcher Cindy', 'Sometimes at night I would... I would just... *sniffle* I<br/>wished I would disappear.')
('Researcher Cindy', "But I just can't go public with this. He's such an<br/>incredible scientist—I couldn't bear to ruin his whole<br/>career over this.")
('Quatre', 'I see...')
('Agnès', 'I wonder who our client could have been, then?')
('Van', "Good question... We did get a couple hints from<br/>yesterday's questioning. Let's start with those.")
('Researcher Cindy', 'Umm... I may be barking up the wrong tree here, but<br/>have you met a man called Aster?')
('Researcher Cindy', "He's another one of my colleagues. I last saw him at<br/>this morning's meeting.")
('Researcher Cindy', 'He was mumbling to himself throughout<br/>the meeting... It made me kinda curious.')
('Researcher Cindy', "I think I heard him say, 'They took it. If they get the<br/>evidence, he's done.'")
('Van', "Huh. That's my first time hearin' his name.")
('Van', "'They took it' could very well mean us takin' his job<br/>off our bulletin board. You might be on to<br/>somethin' there.")
('Risette', 'Could you tell us where we might find him?')
('Researcher Cindy', 'He mentioned that he was doing his work on a sofa<br/>today since the lab is out of commission.')
('Researcher Cindy', "He's probably still somewhere in the institute, but I<br/>couldn't tell you where specifically.")
('Van', 'Got it. Thanks for the info.')
('Researcher Cindy', "Please, think nothing of it. I just... I hope the<br/>professor's okay. The harassment is one thing,<br/>but his disappearance has everyone shaken.")
('Researcher Cindy', "And I hope I can bounce back from all this... I know<br/>it's been tough on everybody while I was away.")
('Researcher Cindy', 'If you do find Aster, give him my regards.')
('Researcher Aster', "Hmm... This theory could greatly simplify the<br/>equations we're using. I'll have to test that out at<br/>the lab.")
('Researcher Aster', "...Or, wait, no. I forgot, it's a total mess right now.<br/>I have to wait until it's cleared up.")
('Researcher Aster', "I need to do the professor proud. I can't screw<br/>this up...")
('Van', "'Sup. You Aster? Cindy told us about you.")
('Researcher Aster', 'And who are you, if I may ask?')
('Van', "We're from Arkride Solutions. Guy put out a request<br/>on our bulletin board yesterday, and we're lookin' into<br/>their case.")
('Researcher Aster', "(It's them...!)")
('Researcher Aster', "I...wasn't expecting you to seek me out in person.")
('Researcher Aster', 'I did find out that you took the job, though...and that<br/>you talked to the professor directly.')
('Researcher Aster', 'I saw you leaving his room yesterday.')
('Van', "Well, that saves me the rundown. Sorry if that's not<br/>what you wanted us to do.")
('Van', "The way you wrote the request made it sound like you<br/>just wanted him to stop, instead of tryin' to bring<br/>legal action against him.")
('Researcher Aster', "That's right. Very perceptive of you, kudos.")
('Researcher Aster', 'Do you mind telling me what he said?')
('Van', 'Not at all.')
('System', 'Van provided Aster all the testimonies they had<br/>recorded the previous day.')
('System', 'They then summarized their conversation with<br/>Professor Callaghan.')
('Researcher Aster', "*sigh* Yeah, I had a feeling he'd do that.")
('Quatre', 'I completely agree, his behavior was reprehensible.<br/>We tried to explain that to him...')
('Quatre', "...but he just wouldn't listen. Nothing worked.")
('Quatre', "Of course, that's all on the back burner now...")
('Researcher Aster', "Yeah. One look at this lab and you can tell how<br/>oppressive it is. I'm really worried for him.")
('Researcher Aster', "It's gotten so bad that I actually considered going<br/>public with this. This is just too much to bear.")
('Researcher Aster', "But, well...not right now, I won't. His safety<br/>takes priority.")
('Agnès', "So it's not just revenge, is it? You sound as if there's<br/>more to it.")
('Researcher Aster', "Oh, absolutely. I've never met a more talented,<br/>passionate man than Professor Callaghan.")
('Researcher Aster', "Who he is as a person doesn't change who he is as a<br/>scientist—he's one of the greatest minds of<br/>our generation.")
('Researcher Aster', 'I still respect him...but all the same, I hate how he<br/>betrayed me.')
('Van', "That's what a lot of your... Wait, hold on, back up<br/>a bit. What do you mean, 'betrayed'?")
('Researcher Aster', 'Above this abuse, above all else, Callaghan betrayed<br/>my feelings. Every time I see the professor with<br/>HIM, it makes my blood boil...!')
('Researcher Aster', 'He does a bunch of work behind our backs, he goes<br/>scurrying out of town on a whim...')
('Researcher Aster', 'Just...why?! Am I not good enough for you,<br/>Professor...? Why would you just toss me to the<br/>wayside like that?')
('Researcher Aster', "I'm... I'm sorry. I'm ranting.")
('Quatre', "N-No, it's quite all right...")
('Quatre', '(It sounds like Aster had a much more complicated<br/>relationship with Professor Callaghan...)')
('Aaron', "(One guy yesterday said some of the professor's<br/>assistants were acting real weird lately—but he put<br/>that down to stress.)")
('Aaron', 'Well, this is definitely news to us.')
('Van', "We're workin' on another job, actually—they want us<br/>to try and find him.")
('Van', "If you know anything about where he might've gone,<br/>you mind sharin' with us?")
('Researcher Aster', "Oh, you're looking for him? Of course!")
('Researcher Aster', "I like to think I know him pretty well. I don't like<br/>letting him out of my sight for even a second.")
('Risette', 'Could you tell us about this individual he meets<br/>with, then?')
('Researcher Aster', "I don't know his name, but I know he's not from the<br/>institute—he doesn't dress like it, anyway. He's real<br/>cushy with the professor now.")
('Researcher Aster', "I've never gotten a good look at his face—I only ever<br/>see him at night.")
('Feri', 'You said he goes out of town a lot. Do you<br/>know where?')
('Researcher Aster', "Yeah. The old outdoor experiment complex.<br/>You're familiar with it, right, Quatre?")
('Quatre', 'Right, that building on the outskirts of the canyon.<br/>That does sound weird... What on earth was he doing<br/>out there?')
('Researcher Aster', 'I wish I knew. All I know is that he would head out<br/>there with that strange friend of his.')
('Researcher Aster', "I just don't understand why he's gallivanting off with<br/>some other man when he has me...?")
('Quatre', 'Er...')
('Van', "Well, thanks for the info. That's a really big help.")
('Researcher Aster', "I'm glad to hear that. Please bring him back safely<br/>for me.")
('System', 'Quest School of Hard Knocks completed!')
('System', 'Earned')
('System', 'Received')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'Oh! Hello, everyone.')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'I take it you saw our request?')
('Van', 'The one about gathering ingredients for<br/>that painkiller? Yeah, we got it.')
('Van', "I get why the request said 'we' now, too.")
('Quatre', 'Ah. Now that you mention it, it did.')
('Quatre', 'You two are working together on this, I take it?')
('Van', "Oh, we haven't had the chance, sorry.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "Oh, really? Well, we're glad you came, at any rate.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "We'd like you to help us gather materials for a new<br/>type of painkiller.")
('Van', "Got'cha. You're not workin' alone, from the looks<br/>of it?")
('Quatre', 'The two of you are working on it together?')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "That's right—I don't think you've met him before.<br/>Everyone, this is Ray!")
('Researcher Ray', "Pleased to meet you. I'm a researcher from ZCF over<br/>in Liberl.")
('Researcher Ray', 'Esmeray gave me a call asking for some help with this<br/>new project of hers, so here I am. I just flew in<br/>this morning.')
('Researcher Ray', 'I study biology—plants, specifically.')
('Researcher Ray', "My most notable work would be the acerbic tomato,<br/>if you've ever heard of that.")
('Researcher Ray', "I don't blame you if it's flown under your radar,<br/>though—it hasn't really caught on in Calvard yet.")
('Feri', "I don't remember anything like that...")
('Agnès', "I think I've seen it on occasion at some imported<br/>food stores. It's that really bitter tomato, isn't it?")
('Aaron', "I've had a few of those, I think. Acquired taste, to say<br/>the least.")
('Risette', "I hear they've spread from Liberl to Crossbell and<br/>Erebonia as well.")
('Van', "I've tried 'em once or twice, but they ain't really<br/>my thing.")
('Agnès', "Yeah, I'm not surprised. Acerbic tomatoes are about<br/>the exact opposite of sweet.")
('Quatre', 'I like them quite a bit, actually.')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "So do I. They're the perfect pick-me-up when I feel<br/>myself nodding off.")
('Researcher Ray', "Haha. Glad I've got two people in my camp, at least!")
('Researcher Ray', 'I ended up creating them by total accident in a<br/>greenhouse, if you could believe it.')
('Researcher Ray', "Imagine the shock and horror on my colleagues' faces<br/>when they unsuspectingly bit into one for the<br/>first time.")
('Researcher Ray', "Ohh, I'll treasure those memories forever.")
('Researcher Ray', 'That was the impetus for my biology research. I was<br/>just drifting along without a specific focus before<br/>then, but those tomatoes saved me.')
('Agnès', "(He seems a little...eccentric, doesn't he?)")
('Aaron', '(Thought that was how all lab coat types operate.)')
('Quatre', "(Well, to an extent, yes, but I'd say he makes the rest<br/>of us look normal.)")
('Feri', '(Wow... Are they really that bitter? I kinda wanna<br/>try one.)')
('Van', "Got it. So you're the botany guy, and then Esmeray's<br/>the bioengineering buff.")
('Van', 'What led you two to work on a painkiller<br/>together, then?')
('Risette', 'That does seem like a bit of a leap.')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "Heehee. You've got that look on your face, Quatre—<br/>you've worked it out, haven't you?")
('Quatre', 'Well, yes. Being your understudy clues me in to<br/>these things.')
('Quatre', "First, though, I think we should figure out whether or<br/>not we'll take this job before we dive into the details.")
('Quatre', "What's your call, Van?")
('Van', 'Hmm...')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'Ray and I would really appreciate your help.')
('Researcher Ray', 'That we would.')
('Van', "All right. We're on board.")
('Van', 'What do you need us to do?')
('Van', 'Sorry, but could we come back to this a bit later?<br/>Kinda busy at the moment.')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "Of course! That's on us for giving you such short<br/>notice, so no worries.")
('Researcher Ray', "If you do find the time to help, we'll be here waiting.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'Oh, thank you so much!')
('Researcher Ray', "Esmeray is the project lead on this, for reference—<br/>I'm just helping out here and there.")
('Researcher Ray', "She'll fill you in on all the details.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "Mhm! Let's go ahead and take it from the top.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "I'm working to develop bionic limbs for amputees,<br/>and these painkillers are an important step in<br/>the process.")
('Quatre', 'I had a hunch that was it.')
('Van', 'Bionic limbs, huh?')
('Agnès', 'Bioengineering indeed. That does sound up<br/>your alley.')
('Feri', 'I know a lot of jaegers use prosthetic arms and stuff.')
('Aaron', 'What does that have to do with painkillers, though?')
('Risette', "Would these artificial limbs link directly to the<br/>user's nerves?")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'Heehee. You know your stuff. Leave it to the Marduk<br/>representative to connect the dots!')
('Risette', "Oh, you flatter me. It's just a field I have a personal<br/>interest in.")
('Quatre', 'Traditional prosthetics rely on extrapolating<br/>movements from other muscles in the body.')
('Quatre', "It's very awkward and inexact, and that limits their<br/>uses for practical applications.")
('Quatre', "Bionic limbs don't have that problem, though.")
('Van', "Yeah, that makes sense. That'd be the best way to put<br/>one in, if you can figure out how.")
('Van', "You hook 'em up to the nerves and the brain can use<br/>'em just like real limbs.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'Right on the money!')
('Agnès', 'That sounds incredible!')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "Yup, yup! It's still mostly theoretical, though.<br/>Practical examples aren't really there yet.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "We still have a lot of issues to work out. That's one of<br/>the big focuses in my department right now.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'And chief among those problems is how painful it is<br/>to have work done on your nerves.')
('Feri', "So THAT'S what the painkiller is for!")
('Researcher Ray', 'Exactly. Nerve work is an extremely painful<br/>procedure, even after the attachment is finished.')
('Researcher Ray', "They're quite literally running a knife across your arm<br/>over and over again, all throughout the process.")
('Agnès', 'Ulgh... That sounds awful.')
('Aaron', "Can't you just use anesthetic like they do<br/>for surgeries?")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "Not really. Anesthesia isn't meant for regular use.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "Your body really wouldn't appreciate you knocking it<br/>out over and over.")
('Quatre', "And that's why you need a painkiller for daily use<br/>with minimal side effects.")
('Quatre', 'I do know that painkillers are often made from<br/>plant extracts...')
('Quatre', "...which is where Ray's research comes in, I assume?")
('Researcher Ray', 'Bingo.')
('Researcher Ray', 'We might have found just the thing for our<br/>new painkiller.')
('Researcher Ray', "It's a luminous plant called Zemuria Moss.<br/>The Septian Church uses it liberally for their<br/>own medicine.")
('Researcher Ray', "I'm told it goes by Soul Moss in the East.")
('Aaron', 'Huh... I think Longkai gave me some of that when<br/>he made that salve for me.')
('Aaron', 'Pretty rare stuff, if I recall.')
('Researcher Ray', "For sure. You don't see it in the usual channels<br/>very often.")
('Researcher Ray', 'I tried asking my colleagues to see if they had any, but<br/>I came up empty handed, unfortunately.')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "And that's what led us to you!")
('Van', 'Got it. Sounds pretty straightforward.')
('Van', "This ain't our home turf, though. I can't exactly call in<br/>any favors here—all my connections are back home.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "Oh, you don't need to worry about sourcing it.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "We've figured out that it grows naturally here!")
('Researcher Ray', 'Back in Liberl, you can find it in the Kaldia<br/>Limestone Cave underneath the city of Zeiss.')
('Researcher Ray', 'That cave has just the right humidity and proximity<br/>to the septium veins. We posited that it might grow<br/>in other caves that meet those criteria.')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'So we looked around here, and, bingo! We managed<br/>to find one.')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "It's in the deepest part of that metal mine Quatre<br/>went into yesterday.")
('Quatre', 'Really? I should be able to guide everyone there, then.')
('Quatre', "You'll find the entrance in that open area where you<br/>rescued me yesterday.")
('Aaron', "Well, that's convenient. Heh.")
('Van', 'That explains why you brought this to us and not<br/>the guild.')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "Right, here's the key. This'll let you in.")
('System', 'Esmeray handed Van a rusty old key.')
('Van', 'Perfect, thanks.')
('Quatre', "Let's get going, then.")
('Agnès', 'Be careful in there!')
('System', 'Esmeray handed Van a rusty old key.')
('System', 'Quest Rx Research started!')
('Van', "This is what you're lookin' for, right?")
('System', "Van handed over the Zemuria Moss he'd gathered.")
('Researcher Ray', 'Yep. This is the stuff.')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'Oh, thank you so much! Now our research can go<br/>forward as planned.')
('Researcher Ray', "We can't let ol' George do all the work, can we?")
('Agnès', 'Is he a colleague of yours at the institute?')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "Oh, no. He's all the way over in Erebonia, actually.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "He's a student of Professor Schmidt—another<br/>one of the three disciples—and he's researching<br/>artificial limbs, too.")
('Researcher Ray', "Bioengineering isn't his niche, but he's a whiz at just<br/>about anything he puts his mind to.")
('Researcher Ray', "A friend of his lost an arm a while back, and he's been<br/>working really hard on artificial limbs ever since—he's<br/>even published papers on them.")
('Quatre', 'Ah, yeah, I remember reading those papers.')
('Quatre', 'They were comprehensive, to say the least: not just<br/>the theory, but design limits, materials,<br/>budgeting, everything. Truly a brilliant man.')
('Risette', "You're quite well connected, I see—even outside your<br/>specific field.")
('Researcher Ray', 'I happened to meet him when he visited ZCF to<br/>study a while back.')
('Researcher Ray', 'We hit it off pretty well. Turns out we share a lot of<br/>friends ourselves.')
('Researcher Ray', "We plan to share this painkiller with him once we've<br/>finished developing it.")
('Researcher Ray', "We may come from different backgrounds, but we're<br/>both engineers working toward a common goal.<br/>That's the whole point of science, no?")
('Aaron', 'Aww. How sweet.')
('Feri', "That's kind of a thing among jaegers, too. At the end<br/>of the day, work's work.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'And having some friendly competition never hurts!')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "Well, we'll try not to take up any more of your time.<br/>Thank you so much for your help!")
('Van', 'Heh. Glad to be of service.')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'That goes for you as well, Quatre—but please do try<br/>and rest when you can.')
('Quatre', "Well, same to you, Essy! Thanks, though. I'm glad we<br/>could help.")
('System', 'Quest Rx Research completed!')
('System', 'Received')
('Van', "Ain't the time for turnin' tail. We gotta get inside.")
('Van', "The institute ain't gonna wait for us.")
('System', 'Where would you like to go?')
('System', 'The door is locked.')
('Van', 'Hmm... Nobody here, from the looks of it.')
('Agnès', "The door's locked!")
('Quatre', 'Someone must have locked it to keep the archaisms<br/>from coming inside.')
('Quatre', "We'll have to find another way around!")
('Van', "We should probably stay away from Professor<br/>Callaghan's lab for now.")
