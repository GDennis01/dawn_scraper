('Agnès', 'Th-That bus has been surrounded by monsters!')
('Feri', 'Wolves! I count six, seven...eight!')
('Van', "Bah. I hate workin' for free.")
('Agnès', "You can't say that! How can you stand by when there<br/>are people in danger?!")
('Van', "I know, I know. Watch yourself if you're gonna<br/>pitch in.")
('Van', 'You in or you out, Feri?')
('Feri', "What do you think? I'm in!")
('Agnès', 'What is that?')
('Feri', "It's a rifleblade used in our corps.")
('Feri', "I'll use it to keep both of you safe. Now may Arusha<br/>watch over us!")
('Van', "Okay, then. Let's do this!")
('Feri', 'That was the last of them.')
('Van', 'Heh. Not bad.')
('Agnès', "I already know how good Van is, but I'm amazed at<br/>how fast you are, Feri!")
('Agnès', 'Are all Warriors of Kruga like that?')
('Feri', "N-No way! I'm still a rookie! Most of them are much<br/>better than me.")
('Feri', 'And your arts were awesome, Agnès! So is your staff!')
('Agnès', "Aww, thank you. It's called an orbal staff, and...")
('Van', 'Come on, now.')
('Van', '(Wish I knew what was up with those monsters.<br/>It was almost like—)')
('Driver Roger', 'Hellooo! You three over there!')
('Driver Roger', 'Are you okay? We really owe you one!')
('Driver Roger', 'We had to pull over because of engine trouble, and<br/>the next thing we knew, we were surrounded!')
(40301, "I have to say, you've got some incredible<br/>combat skills!")
(40302, 'What are you, bracers?')
('Van', 'Nah. Just ordinary passersby.')
('Van', 'You work for West Calvard Transport, right?<br/>Lemme give you my card.')
('Driver Roger', 'Arkride Solutions?')
('Van', "I'm just a guy who helps people with their problems.<br/>Not affiliated with the Bracer Guild.")
('Van', "Even open to fightin' monsters and stuff like I did<br/>just there—for a price.")
('Driver Roger', 'Wait...')
('Agnès', 'Umm... Van...')
('Van', "Hate to come across like this, but you would've been<br/>screwed without us, right?")
('Van', "So if you could let your company know that and have<br/>them foot the bill, that'd be great.")
('Driver Roger', 'What?! But the police or the guild would never—')
('Van', "Well, we ain't cops or bracers. And you can't keep the<br/>lights on with a thank-you.")
('Van', "Not tryin' to scam you here—I just want a fair price<br/>for our services. We'll even escort you to town to<br/>finish the job.")
('Van', "Wouldn't imagine you're in a rush to get attacked<br/>AGAIN on the road, are you?")
('Driver Roger', 'Hmm... You got me there.')
('Agnès', '*sigh* This is so inappropriate...')
('Feri', "I can see where you're coming from, but I don't think<br/>it's inappropriate at all.")
('Feri', "Whether it's the water we drink or the security to see<br/>we're safe from harm, nothing in life is free.")
('Agnès', 'I...suppose so.<br/>(I wonder if everyone from the Central East has such<br/>a practical mindset.)')
('Driver Roger', "All right, then. We'll hire you to take us down<br/>to Creil.")
('Driver Roger', "And as soon as we arrive, I'll phone my boss.")
('Van', "Sounds like a plan. Now c'mon, you two—back in<br/>the truck.")
('Feri', 'Okay!')
('Agnès', 'Oh, all right...')
('Traveler Melchior', "Hmm... I wasn't expecting that to be how this ended.")
('Traveler Melchior', "That young man's most certainly caught<br/>my attention...")
('Agnès', 'This road is surrounded by so much natural beauty...<br/>and the air is so crisp and fresh.')
('Agnès', "It's too bad the monsters here and there are spoiling<br/>such lovely scenery.")
('Feri', "On the plus side, they don't seem as riled up as they<br/>did when they attacked that bus.")
('Feri', "As long as we don't go out of our way to provoke<br/>them, I don't think they'll be a problem.")
('Van', 'I agree—just be aware that could change at<br/>any moment.')
('Van', "I don't think enough time's passed since the bus<br/>incident for us to let our guards down here. Stay alert.")
('Agnès', 'We will!')
('Feri', "Do you think this is that man's stolen bicycle?")
('Van', "That's what I'd put my money on. It sure wasn't here<br/>when we passed in the truck.")
('Agnès', 'It looks to be partially damaged, unfortunately...')
('Agnès', '...but at least we can recover it for him.')
('Agnès', "Now I'm just curious what happened to the man who<br/>stole it.")
('Feri', "Yeah. The owner told us the thief said he mentioned<br/>needing to run away from something, didn't he?")
('Feri', 'Then why would he just discard it here?')
('Van', "I'm guessin' something happened that they weren't<br/>counting on.")
('Van', "This might be a peaceful area, but there's still<br/>monsters around. It ain't hard to guess what<br/>could've happened.")
('Agnès', 'That sounded like a wolf howling!')
('Feri', 'I can sense a bunch of monsters around a single point<br/>a little ways away!')
('Agnès', 'Do you think the bicycle thief is under attack?!')
('Van', "Could well be. Let's get a move on in the direction<br/>we heard that howl from.")
('Van', 'Think we need to speak with the thief before we can<br/>call this case closed.')
('Feri', "Let's hurry!")
(40501, 'Grr...')
(61960, 'Ruff! Ruff!')
('Van', 'Well, this is some mess.')
('Feri', "It looks like they're fighting over who gets to eat him.")
('Nathan', 'Wha—?! Who are you?!')
('Nathan', 'Oh, like I care who you are! Just help me, please!')
('Nathan', "They just came at me all of a sudden! They're gonna<br/>have me for—")
('Agnès', "Keep your voice down! You'll just provoke them!")
('Nathan', 'Eeek!')
('Feri', 'Are you okay?!')
('Van', 'Not more wolves...')
('Van', "(There's somethin' off about 'em...)")
('Agnès', 'Oh! Half of the wolves just ran away!')
(61960, 'Grr... Ruff! Ruff!')
('Feri', "It looks like the other half aren't going to back down<br/>so easily, though. Something's really got them in<br/>a frenzy.")
('Agnès', "And just look at how red their eyes are! I want to<br/>know what's happened to make them this way, but<br/>they aren't going to wait for us to find out.")
('Van', "At least we don't have to deal with as many of 'em as<br/>I thought. Let's do this!")
('Feri', 'Whew... That takes care of them.')
('Agnès', "Umm... I apologize if I'm wrong, but did you recently<br/>steal a bicycle?")
('Agnès', "If you did, we'd like to ask you a few questions.")
('Nathan', "Y-Yeah, that's me... Go ahead. I'm not gonna try and<br/>fight you.")
('Van', '(...What was that?)')
('Van', "(Between the wolves that attacked that bus and the<br/>ones we just had to fight, something's definitely not<br/>right here.)")
('Van', "(It's like they're being controlled by fear somehow...<br/>Bah. I just can't put my finger on it.)")
('Agnès', 'Are you all right, Van?')
('Agnès', "We still haven't questioned our suspect.")
('Van', 'Oh, right.')
('Van', "We're Arkride Solutions. We're here on behalf of a<br/>guy who had his bike stolen.")
('Van', "We managed to recover it, but I don't think just<br/>gettin' that back is gonna satisfy our client.")
('Van', "Why'd you steal it at all? C'mon, fess up.")
('Nathan', "Wha—?! Don't play dumb with me! There's no way<br/>you're here on behalf of that guy!")
('Nathan', "You came to Creil to shake some mira outta me,<br/>didn't you?!")
('Feri', '...What are you talking about?')
('Agnès', 'Do you know him, Van?')
('Van', 'Nope. I know he was on that bus, but I never met<br/>him before that.')
('Van', "What's goin' on?")
('Van', "Nope. Never even met him before. What's goin' on?")
('Nathan', "What?! Th-That's what I want to know!")
('Nathan', "Then you're not a debt collector from the companies I<br/>owe money to? Really?")
('Van', "Nope. We're Arkride Solutions, like I just said.")
('Van', "I'm not gonna say we never do debt collection work,<br/>but we haven't been asked to come for you, that's<br/>for sure.")
('Nathan', '*sigh* Oh, Aidios... What a relief. I did all that<br/>for nothing...')
('Agnès', 'So the reason you stole that bicycle was because you<br/>assumed Van was a debt collector and wanted to run<br/>away from him?')
('Nathan', "Yeah. I've borrowed a lot of money from a bunch of<br/>different places over the years. It's gotten to the point<br/>where I'm too deep in to get out...")
('Nathan', "So I figured my only hope was to flee abroad.<br/>That's how I ended up on that bus.")
('Nathan', 'But I saw you as soon as we arrived in Creil—and I<br/>could tell you were a pro.')
('Nathan', "I was convinced you HAD to be someone who'd<br/>come to collect my debts.")
('Nathan', 'After that, I was just looking for an opportunity to<br/>flee as far away as possible.')
('Van', "And when that opportunity presented itself, you<br/>stole some guy's bike and rode off—only to get<br/>surrounded by monsters immediately after.")
('Feri', "Well, I'm glad we were able to clear up that<br/>misunderstanding between us.")
('Agnès', 'How about we go back to the village for now, then?')
('Agnès', "There's no guarantee that more monsters won't come<br/>for us—and we need to return that bicycle to<br/>its owner.")
('Van', "I think that's a good idea. Don't try and run away<br/>from us again, you hear?")
('Nathan', "I won't. I doubt I could escape from you guys even if I<br/>wanted to.")
('Feri', 'Then off we go!')
('Kyle', 'Hey! Is everyone all right?!')
('Agnès', "Kyle! I didn't expect you to leave the village.")
('Van', "You really were sweatin' over that bike, huh?")
('Van', "Though I'd be the same if it was my truck, so I can't<br/>say I don't get how you feel.")
('Agnès', 'I think that about sums up all that happened.')
('Agnès', 'Your bicycle is now officially back in your hands—<br/>even if it is a little worse for wear.')
('Kyle', "Whew... Thank you so much. I'm just happy to have<br/>it back!")
('Feri', "I'm glad we were able to help you!")
('Kyle', 'Oh, right. I need to ask about how much you charge.')
('Kyle', "I hope I've got enough to cover your costs... If it'll<br/>cost more than about 20,000 mira, I might need to<br/>pay in installments.")
('Van', "We don't charge anywhere near that. We're not here<br/>to rip you off, y'know.")
('Van', "We're a little more expensive than the Bracer Guild,<br/>but we only charge for time spent and<br/>necessary expenses.")
('Kyle', "R-Really?! What a relief! You're clearly really good at<br/>what you do, so I thought you'd charge an arm and<br/>a leg.")
('Kyle', "I'll make sure to wire you your money later, then.")
('Van', "Right. Then it's time to talk about what to do about<br/>our friend here.")
('Van', "How do you want us to handle this? If you've got any<br/>requests, we're all ears.")
('Nathan', 'I-I really am sorry for stealing it! It was all just a<br/>stupid misunderstanding on my part.')
('Nathan', 'I know! How about I pay these guys in your place?<br/>It might take me a while to gather the<br/>money, though...')
('Nathan', 'So please, give a guy a break!')
('Kyle', 'Hmm... Well, if he means what he says, my heart says<br/>to forgive him.')
('Kyle', "It feels like he shouldn't get off almost completely<br/>scot-free after stealing someone's property, though...")
('Kyle', "Hmm... You don't have any good ideas on what to do<br/>in a situation like this, do you?")
('Nathan', 'Oh, no...')
('Feri', "Hmm... I can't think of anything off the top of<br/>my head. I know how we'd handle it as warriors, but I<br/>know it's not the same here.")
('Agnès', "How about we have him sign some kind of legally<br/>binding document? I suspect there's an even better<br/>way of handling this, though...")
('Van', "(We're dealin' with a guy who's already on the run<br/>from his debts. If we go soft on him, he's not gonna<br/>take this seriously.)")
('Van', '(One option is just to hand him in to the authorities<br/>and do this by the book.)')
('Van', "(Kinda bugs me to leave the client's bike<br/>damaged, too. That's not fair on him at all.)")
('Van', '(Maybe we could have the thief work here in town to<br/>raise the money to repair it?)')
('Van', "I'm thinkin' we should do this by the book and let the<br/>law handle it.")
('Van', 'In other words, hand him in to the police station here<br/>in Creil.')
('Van', 'We managed to recover the bike already, but he still<br/>committed a crime. He needs to answer for it.')
('Kyle', 'You make a good point...')
('Nathan', 'Wh-What?!')
('Van', 'Unfortunately for him, this is gonna make it a lot<br/>harder to run from those debt collectors if they do<br/>show up.')
('Van', "But that's better than being kicked outta the village<br/>and eaten by monsters.")
('Nathan', "Urgh... I mean, you're right, but...")
('Nathan', '*sigh* I guess it is time to pay the piper.')
('Kyle', "I'll go along with him and explain what happened to<br/>the officer in charge.")
('Van', 'Thanks.')
('Agnès', 'We should make our way back to the village<br/>now, then.')
('Van', "Normally, I'd say we should hand him over to<br/>the authorities...")
('Van', "...but how does makin' him pay for the bike's repairs<br/>sound to you?")
('Nathan', "Y-You know I don't have that kind of mira, right?<br/>Or any at all, for that matter!")
('Van', "Sure. That's why you'll be working in the village to<br/>earn it.")
('Nathan', 'Wha—?!')
('Kyle', "That DOES sound good. That way, he'll have time to<br/>reflect on what he did, and I won't have to shell out<br/>mira for repairs.")
('Kyle', "But I feel like I'll be causing trouble for the people<br/>here with this solution...")
('Van', "I'll help smooth things over with 'em, don't worry.")
('Van', "Oh, and don't even think of using this as a chance to<br/>escape, buddy.")
('Van', "If you try that, I'll contact the cops or those debt<br/>collectors you got and you'll never be able to go out in<br/>public again.")
('Nathan', 'Gah...')
('Nathan', '*sigh* I guess this is how things gotta be. Man, I<br/>never should have stolen that bike...')
('Agnès', 'We should make our way back to the village<br/>now, then.')
