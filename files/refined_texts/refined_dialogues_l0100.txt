('Ashen', "I'm impressed you managed to book a hotel without<br/>us noticing.")
('Van', "Havin' eyes on me all the time ain't really my style.")
('Van', 'So, where to?')
('Ashen', "The Eastern Quarter is only a short drive from here,<br/>so why don't we take the scenic route?")
('Ashen', "This car's comfy, so I figure we can just chat here.")
('Van', "Now you're speakin' my language.")
('Feri', "We're being followed.")
('Ashen', "Don't mind them. Bàbà's just overprotective.")
('Van', "Given why we're here, I can't really blame him.")
('Ashen', "It's annoying, but you're right. I'm more than ready to<br/>be rid of Almata.")
('Agnès', 'Would you mind telling us more about the situation?')
('Ashen', 'Sure.')
('Ashen', "Langport is Heiyue's turf, but we'll allow just about<br/>anyone to do business here.")
('Ashen', 'For example, folks from Edith and the Central East<br/>often set up shop around town.')
('Van', "Makes sense. Lotsa money to be made in the<br/>country's second biggest city.")
('Van', 'And Almata wanted a piece of the pie.')
('Ashen', 'Last month, they made their move.')
('Ashen', "A new business in New Town called the 'Messeldam<br/>Trading Company.'")
('Ashen', 'Before we knew it, there were suspicious people all<br/>over the city.')
('Ashen', "But there's more to it...")
('Ashen', "Almata's not even packing the streets with their<br/>own members.")
('Ashen', 'They hired thugs part time from all over to come in<br/>and start fights.')
('Ashen', "So far, they've mostly targeted stores and young<br/>people in the Eastern Quarter, but nowhere is<br/>truly safe.")
('Agnès', "That's awful.")
('Van', 'Sending out hired grunts to do their dirty work, eh?')
('Van', "That's weird. Never shied away from throwin' their<br/>people to the wolves before.")
('Ashen', "I suspect they're saving their members for when the<br/>real conflict begins.")
('Feri', "Until then, they'll continue attacking Heiyue.")
('Feri', "It's a war of attrition...")
('Ashen', "At the end of the day, they're just a bunch of<br/>wannabes buzzing around like flies.")
('Ashen', "Heiyue's in no real danger, so we've been letting them<br/>struggle in vain.")
('Ashen', 'Unfortunately, not everyone is happy with<br/>that mindset.')
('Agnès', 'Your childhood friend?')
('Van', "Lay it on me: what's this guy's deal?")
('Ashen', "His name is Aaron Wei. He's nineteen years old and<br/>was born and raised here in Langport.")
('Ashen', "He's a proficient martial artist of the Gekka style, one<br/>of the East's three big schools, specializing in<br/>swordsmanship and hand-to-hand combat.")
('Ashen', 'One time he even took down a rowdy group of sailors<br/>all on his own.')
('Feri', "Whoa! That's awesome!")
('Ashen', "People have taken to giving him silly nicknames like<br/>'the prodigy of Langport' and 'the Crimson Khan.'")
('Ashen', 'For as free of a spirit as he is, he really does care about<br/>the community.')
('Ashen', "Honestly, it's no wonder why everyone in the Eastern<br/>Quarter loves him.")
('Agnès', 'He sounds very charismatic.')
('Ashen', "You're telling me. I just wish he'd learn to rein it in<br/>every now and then.")
('Ashen', 'Still, Bàbà and the others think he could make a<br/>name for himself in Heiyue if he decides to join.')
('Ashen', "If he doesn't get himself killed first, that is. As you<br/>can imagine, he hasn't taken kindly to outsiders<br/>roughing up his people.")
('Ashen', "The other day, he and his friends attacked a large<br/>gang of Almata's grunts all by themselves.")
('Van', 'They retaliate yet?')
('Ashen', "Strangely enough, no. They haven't launched a single<br/>attack since then—let alone tried to get revenge.")
('Ashen', "We have no way of knowing what they're scheming.")
('Ashen', 'To make matters worse, Aaron sees this as an<br/>opportunity to finally drive Almata out of town<br/>for good.')
('Ashen', "But I can't imagine they're going to go quietly...")
('Agnès', "If he's as hot-blooded as you say, you're right<br/>to worry.")
('Feri', 'I want to see his skills in action.')
('Ashen', 'Heehee. Well, if we hurry, you may get to see<br/>something special.')
('Ashen', "Let's head over to the Eastern Quarter.")
