('Melise', 'What? There was another incident?! Oh, my...')
('Melise', "The president said he's going to wrap up the<br/>inspection early, so I guess this trip's drawing to<br/>a close.")
('Melise', 'Wait. How on earth am I gonna pack all my<br/>theater merch? I...may have bought one too<br/>many things.')
('Melise', "Ahaha... I might've gotten just a teensy bit carried<br/>away yesterday. So sorry!")
(15290, "Ugh... You went on and on about 'the Eastern<br/>Theater' this and 'the Eastern Theater' that while we<br/>were out drinking.")
(15291, "I'm getting a hangover just thinking about it...")
(15291, "I know I said we should enjoy ourselves to the fullest,<br/>but everyone's on edge after last night's incident.<br/>Let's not get carried away again.")
('Melise', "Fiiiiiine... Guess I can show a little restraint. I'll just<br/>stick to rummaging through the theater's gift shop.")
(15290, "(...I think she's developing an obsession with<br/>that place.)")
(15290, 'I-I suppose now may not be the best time to sightsee.')
(15291, "Don't think we should wander around<br/>aimlessly, either. It's too scary around here...")
('Melise', "I'd LOVE to watch another performance and cheer<br/>my heart out, but I'll just stick to shopping<br/>their wares.")
(15290, "(...I'm becoming mildly concerned about her.)")
('Melise', '*squeal* The Eastern Theater is INCREDIBLE!')
('Melise', 'The Eastern charm, the stunning choreography, and<br/>those dashing performers...')
('Melise', "All right, boys. Back in we go! I can't WAIT to see<br/>the next performance!")
(15290, 'G-Get a hold of yourself, Melise!')
(15291, "We've been watching these nonstop for five hours!<br/>Don't make us watch another! Please!")
('Melise', "Theater is the greatest thing in the world! I'm<br/>totally hooked!")
('Melise', "They're putting on a different performance for this<br/>next showing, and I HAVE to see it!")
(15290, 'All right. It is time for us to indulge in the greatest<br/>part of onsite inspections: partying! Wahahaha!')
(15291, "Of course, Mr. President! Let's all enjoy ourselves to<br/>the fullest from sun up to sun down!")
(15290, "I hear the Eastern Quarter's night market is<br/>quite something. I'm excited to see what it has<br/>to offer!")
(15290, 'Hmm? Is something troubling you, Melise? Sorry to<br/>make you tag along, but we needed to, erm, liven up<br/>this inspection trip. You understand, I hope.')
('Melise', "Oh, umm, yes, I understand what you mean perfectly.<br/>I'm...honored you invited me on this trip.")
('Melise', "(Ugh. Like HELL I am! This is sexual harassment!<br/>I'm sick of sucking up to these sleezy pigs in suits!)")
(15290, "Now, then. I think it's time we begin our<br/>sightseeing—err...onsite inspection!")
('Melise', "(I've gotta get away from these two bastards. Maybe I<br/>can slip away into the crowd midway through...)")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "I guess it's possible I was just seeing things...")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Wait a minute... Isn't Molujia Archipelago just across<br/>the sea? There's a rumor about pirates being there.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Maybe I WAS right all along! If there really is a ghost<br/>ship around, that'd be one heck of a scoop!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Now where did Maxim run off to?')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "I thought I saw him earlier, but I think it might've<br/>just been a lookalike. This might be tougher than<br/>I thought...")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "But I'm not giving up! If there's a story to tell about<br/>him, then darn it, I'm gonna tell it!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "I'll do whatever it takes to bridge the gap between me<br/>and Dingo!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Now where did Maxim run off to? I'll get the dirt on<br/>him if it's the last thing I do!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "...Ugh. Now I'm starting to sound like some<br/>third-rate gossip columnist.")

('Sei', 'Aaron kicked so much ass in that fight. Wish I was<br/>half as good a fighter as he is.')
('Sei', "Probably best not to compare myself to him, though.<br/>It's not gonna do my self-esteem any good.")
('Sei', "Least I got a good nose on me, though. Serves me<br/>well when I'm on lookout!")
('Sei', "Can't wait to hear Aaron's stories tonight!")
('Sei', "I also like gatherin' info while on guide duty, but he's<br/>waaay better at that than me.")
('Sei', 'He always pairs up with the best people and has the<br/>juiciest stories to tell. How does he do it?!')
('Sei', "Oh, hello there! I've never seen you around this place.<br/>Are you tourists?")
('Sei', "I'd be more than happy to guide you around the city.<br/>The name's Sei, and I'll show you all the best sights<br/>Langport has to off—ow!")
('Sei', "Damn it. My freakin' arms hurt like hell...")
('Agnès', "Are you injured? I'm so sorry...")
('Sei', "Ack! N-No, I'm okay, promise. I just, umm, ran into<br/>a bit of trouble, is all. We got someone who has our<br/>backs, so I'll be all right.")
('Sei', 'Sometimes, outsider goons come here to stir up<br/>trouble, and we have a duty to protect our home from<br/>the likes of them!')
('Van', '(Outsiders?)')
('Van', "(Ah, I think I know what he's talkin' about...)")
('Sei', 'We got into a little bit of a scuffle with some outsider<br/>goons recently, and we dragged them over the coals.')
('Sei', "Don't you worry about a thing. My friends and I will<br/>protect you all from the likes of them.")
('Sei', "So, how about that tour? Want me to show you<br/>the theater? My buddy performs there, and<br/>he's amazing!")
('Huang', "Yo, what's up, Aaron? What'cha doin' with that<br/>handyman bastard?")
('Huang', "We were all just talkin' about grabbing a bite to eat.<br/>Wanna ditch this loser and hang with us?")
('Aaron', "Pass. I wanna keep an eye on the old fart while he's<br/>doing his 'job.'")
('Aaron', 'Might learn a thing or two.')
('Sei', "I get'cha, I get'cha. Recon's important and all.<br/>I'll keep that in mind while I'm guidin'<br/>people around.")
('Syd', 'Well, good luck with your mission, Aaron. Catch<br/>ya later.')
('Syd', "Wish you could've joined us, though.")
('Aaron', "Tell you what. The old fart's probably gonna wrap up<br/>soon, so I'll join up with you guys after that.")
('Aaron', "I think an all-out celebration's in order after we<br/>kick the crap outta those outsiders. When I get<br/>there, let's call over some hot chicks and chill.")
('Van', "You better stop callin' me old fart, you little bastard.")
('Huang', "Hell yeah! Tonight's gonna be wild!")
('Sei', "I'm excited to hear all the funny stories about<br/>the handyman!")
('Huang', "Our man Aaron scared the freakin' daylights outta<br/>those outsiders. Serves them right!")
('Huang', "Won't be long now till we send those losers packin'.")
('Huang', 'I say we throw a party to celebrate our inevitable win.<br/>Someone call Aaron right now!')
('Huang', "Haven't seen those outsiders around here lately.<br/>I think they really might be gone for good!")
('Huang', "Time to celebrate! We'll get started with the party<br/>once you're done with your thing, Aaron.")
('Huang', "Let me know when you're ready!")
('Huang', "All right. I ain't feelin' the pain no more, so I'm<br/>getting back into action.")
('Huang', "Aaron was right. Doc's a miracle worker. Didn't take<br/>long at all for that wound to heal.")
('Huang', "I'm ready to throw myself at those damn<br/>outsiders again. As long as we got Aaron by our side,<br/>I've got nothin' to fear.")
('La-Kau', "That caterpillar skewer really was scrumptious.<br/>You don't know what you're missing.")
('La-Kau', "Well, if you change your mind, I'm always here!")
('La-Kau', "I just finished making a delivery to Doctor<br/>Longkai's place.")
('La-Kau', 'And now to focus on my usual business...')
('La-Kau', "...is what I'd like to say, but I find myself distracted<br/>with worry over the mist from yesterday. It's clouded<br/>my thoughts.")
('La-Kau', 'I heard those kids died horrible deaths...')
('La-Kau', "Those punks often gave me a hard time, but I never<br/>would have wished this upon them or anyone. It's<br/>too cruel.")
('La-Kau', "I feel bad about what happened last night, but now's<br/>not the time to close up shop.")
('La-Kau', 'Doctor Longkai placed a rush order for medicine, so I<br/>have to get that done as soon as I can.')
('La-Kau', "Either a lot of folks were injured in yesterday's<br/>incident, or, like me, he's still thinking about<br/>the past...")
('La-Kau', "No, I must be overthinking things. Regardless, I'll be<br/>keeping an extra eye out for trouble.")
('La-Kau', 'Hello there, Van. Doing the rounds with Aaron,<br/>I see.')
('La-Kau', "Fair warning: you're going to need quite a bit of<br/>energy to keep pace with him.")
('La-Kau', 'How about I sell you this tonic powder? It always<br/>gives the elderly a spring in their step!')
('Aaron', 'Damn. Called out.')
('La-Kau', 'Hello there, Van. I assume the young ladies have<br/>retired for the evening?')
('La-Kau', "Now that I think about it, you haven't visited us at<br/>night, have you?")
('La-Kau', "Why don't you try this tonic powder? It's sure to add<br/>a spring in your step. Works wonders for me and<br/>my wife.")
('Van', "I'll consider it.")
('Van', "Though that thing looks a bit sketch, to be honest.<br/>You're gonna tank your brand if you try to sell<br/>that crap.")
('La-Kau', "'Sketch?' 'Crap?!' You wound me, dear sir. I'll have<br/>you know my medicine is the finest in all<br/>of Langport.")
('La-Kau', 'The clinic buys my herbal medicine at<br/>wholesale prices.')
('Van', "Huh. So why're you sellin' food and<br/>ingredients, then? Aren't you leavin' a lot of money<br/>on the table by not goin' all in on medicine?")
('La-Kau', "Sure, but I enjoy selling food as well. Seeing the looks<br/>on unsuspecting customers' faces when they first try<br/>out my stuff is a daily delight.")
('La-Kau', 'I live for the moments when young women complain<br/>about my food being bitter—then end up getting<br/>hooked anyway.')
('Van', "...Oookay, then. Won't question your weirdo kinks.<br/>Out loud.")
('La-Kau', "Do you find yourself exhausted at night, but don't<br/>want to go to sleep? Well, do I have the stuff for you.")
('La-Kau', 'In particular, this stuff works quite well on folks<br/>who...well, you know.')
('La-Kau', 'Welcome! We sell all sorts of classic Eastern cuisine:<br/>dried snakes, frog meat, boiled grasshoppers,<br/>and more.')
('La-Kau', "Oh, and if those don't look particularly appetizing,<br/>we've got medicinal porridges as well.")
('La-Kau', 'How about it, young lady! Any interest?<br/>The nutritional values of these meals are off the charts.')
('Feri', 'Umm... Is it just me, or are there some survival foods<br/>mixed in here...?')
('Feri', "This isn't exactly what I imagine when I think 'classic<br/>Eastern cuisine.'")
('Van', "That's because it isn't. Long time no see, La-Kau.")
('Van', "Sellin' your weird-ass food in Langport now, huh?<br/>How in the hell are you still in business?")
('La-Kau', "Well, well. If it isn't Van. It's certainly been a while,<br/>hasn't it?")
('La-Kau', "I don't recognize the young ones, though.")
('Van', "These two are my part-timers. They're new.")
('Van', "Anyway, don't pay him any mind, girls. He's a jerk<br/>who sells disgusting crap—and tries to pass it off as<br/>medicinal cuisine.")
('La-Kau', "Hmph. Your taste buds didn't develop past the age of<br/>six, so I'm afraid your opinion on this holds<br/>little weight.")
('La-Kau', 'Trust me, young ladies. Adult delicacies can be found<br/>in the most surprising of places.')
('La-Kau', 'Would you like to try some beginner-level<br/>frog porridge?')
('Agnès', "I-I'm okay. Thank you.")
('La-Kau', "I enjoy this line of work, but there are some<br/>folks with unrefined palates who don't get it at all.")
('La-Kau', 'Last week, some riffraff from outside came and<br/>obstructed my business.')
('La-Kau', 'Thankfully, some of the locals ran them out over the<br/>last few days, so now I can conduct my business<br/>as usual.')
('La-Kau', "There isn't a single food in the world that can be<br/>universally loved. That's why I don't go for<br/>mass appeal. I just make food I think is good.")
('La-Kau', 'And as the old saying goes, good medicine always<br/>tastes bitter. The same applies to food.')
('La-Kau', 'If you wish to refine your palate into that of a culinary<br/>connoisseur, stop by my store. My grilled rat dish will<br/>whip you into shape.')
('Caroline', 'This place serves noodles, right?')
('Caroline', 'Is it just me, or do these noodles have a weird shape?')
('Miren', "I prefer the word 'unique.' They're also the best<br/>knife-cut noodles you'll ever find!")
('Miren', 'This dish lets you enjoy classic Eastern flavors while<br/>basking in the skills of the master who cut them.')
('Miren', "If you haven't had them before, you should definitely<br/>try them once.")
('Miren', "It'd be a waste to let life pass you by without ever<br/>having tried knife-cut noodles.")
('Miren', "It'll make for a great conversation topic, too!<br/>Definitely try it out!")
('Miren', "Aaron, I'm...so sorry about Sei and Huang...")
('Miren', 'They were some of the nicest guys I knew.<br/>They enjoyed my noodles so much...')
('Aaron', "I know they did. And don't worry, I'll make damn<br/>sure they're avenged.")
('Miren', "Got'cha. In that case, I'll whip up the best noodles<br/>you'll ever eat and cheer you on.")
('Miren', "Go get 'em, Aaron! Teach those assholes a lesson!")
('Miren', 'Time to dig into your noodles, everyone!')
('Miren', "They're smooth, easy to eat, and great for<br/>revitalizing stamina. Perfect for a time like this.")
('Miren', 'When life gets tough, eat noodles! Like the noodle,<br/>the path to the future is long and winding, so just<br/>take it one step—or slurp—at a time!')
('Miren', 'Master and I are in a funk because of what happened<br/>last night. Today, he messed up the noodle prep for<br/>the first time in ten years.')
('Miren', "We've gotta get it together. People's spirits are at an<br/>all-time low, so we need to do our best to lift them.")
('Miren', 'Easterners are like chewy noodles. Flexible and<br/>strong—but also easy to cut.')
('Miren', "We're going to put smiles back on people's faces with<br/>our noodles. We'll get through this together!")
('Miren', "Welcome! Would you care for some<br/>knife-cut noodles? We also serve ramen if that's more<br/>to your liking.")
('Miren', 'Noodles are a staple of Eastern cuisine.')
('Miren', 'Though I do hear there are places around the world<br/>that use special flour instead of wheat to make soba.')
('Miren', "Heya, Aaron! What's up?")
('Miren', "If you haven't had any dinner yet, I'd be happy to<br/>serve you up some noodles. I'll even give you a<br/>nice discount.")
('Aaron', 'Sweet. I might just take you up on your offer later.')
('Aaron', "Might wanna be careful about who you're being<br/>generous with, though.")
('Aaron', 'I might just eat you up along with your noodles.')
('Miren', '*sigh* That line again?')
('Miren', "Listen, it's not that I don't like you, but you've already<br/>got you-know-who.")
('Miren', "She's a great catch. If you don't ask her out soon,<br/>someone else might snatch her up.")
('Aaron', 'They can have her. She and I are just friends.')
('Miren', 'I love the way you eat your noodles, Aaron!')
('Miren', "When you've been in the biz as long as I have, you<br/>can tell who's a big shot and who isn't based on how<br/>they eat noodles.")
('Miren', "And since you look so darn cool—and hot—when<br/>you slurp 'em up, I can tell you're the real deal!")
('Miren', "Welcome! Would you like to try this knife-cut<br/>noodle bowl? It's an Eastern specialty!")
('Miren', 'Master makes them in the back with his blade.')
('Miren', "I'd love to show you all how the sausage is made, but<br/>he doesn't like people being back there. He's a bit<br/>fussy about sanitation these days.")
('Miren', "But I promise you that his noodles are first rate.<br/>Give it a try—you won't regret it!")
('Miren', 'There are all kinds of Eastern noodles, but knife-cut<br/>noodles are the best of them all.')
('Miren', "It's also fun to see how they get made. Back in the<br/>day, we used to show off the process as a show.")
('Lanfa', 'My daughter told me she got goosebumps before the<br/>mist came out...')
('Lanfa', "I've also noticed Pao's been lending an ear to my<br/>daughter for a little while now.")
('Lanfa', 'Pao seemed especially on edge this morning—a rarity<br/>for her. Something strange is going on. I just know it.')
('Lanfa', "What happened yesterday? There was all that mist,<br/>and apparently, there was an incident outside...<br/>I'm glad we were in the house.")
('Lanfa', "But I'm concerned about Linlin. She was in a daze<br/>last night—saying she could feel something<br/>was wrong.")
('Lanfa', "And she said this before the mist appeared... I need to<br/>sit down with her and try to figure out what's<br/>going on.")
('Lanfa', 'Shopping takes so much longer when the market is<br/>this crowded. I just need to get some food<br/>for dinner...')
('Lanfa', "I've noticed that tourists tend to buy up a lot of the<br/>stores' inventories. Sometimes on weekends, there<br/>isn't much left to buy.")
('Linlin', "I'm getting goosebumps again... It's just<br/>like yesterday.")
('Linlin', "I talked to Pao about it, but she didn't know what was<br/>going on, either.")
('Linlin', "I don't know what to do. What would the fortune<br/>teller lady say?")
('Linlin', 'When the scary mist came out, I got goosebumps.')
('Linlin', 'I also felt like someone was watching me...')
('Linlin', "Even Pao was looking scared... What's going on?")
('Linlin', 'I got to talk with a traveling fortune teller lady a<br/>while ago.')
('Linlin', "She said, 'I can see into the unknown,' and then she<br/>predicted things that actually happened the next day.<br/>She was SO cool!")
('Linlin', 'She also said I had the potential...')
('Linlin', '...but I, uh, have no idea what that means.')
('Jiafei', "Tell you what. I'll cut you a sweet deal.")
('Jiafei', "If you buy this within the next sixty seconds, I'll<br/>throw in this stuffed animal and make it half price.<br/>Whaddaya say?!")
('Caroline', "Wow! That's cheap!")
('Van', "Don't fall for it.")
('Jiafei', "I've still got my sights set on those gullible Imperials...")
('Jiafei', '...but with Heiyue on edge, I prooobably oughta<br/>pump the brakes.')
('Jiafei', "I might be better off settin' up shop in the Empire or<br/>Crossbell at this rate.")
('Jiafei', "Maybe I'll lean on my connections in the capital a<br/>little, too.")
('Jiafei', 'Thanks to that Imperial moron from yesterday, I<br/>made a killing for the first time in ages.')
('Jiafei', "I'm not really feeling the luck today, though.<br/>Everyone's kinda on edge after last night.")
('Jiafei', "I considered using that to my advantage, but when I<br/>heard there were casualties, I thought I'd better not.")
('Jiafei', "Guess I'll just cooperate with Heiyue for the<br/>time being.")
('Jiafei', 'Heeheehee. Imperials are total suckers.')
('Jiafei', "...Oh, I mean, they're my bestest customers!<br/>They don't go raisin' a stink about faults in<br/>my merchandise.")
('Jiafei', "The herbal medicine is TOTALLY safe, and the<br/>Moshy brand's completely legit. Any resemblance to<br/>other characters is purely coincidental!")
('Jiafei', "If I hear 'Moshy is a Mishy ripoff' one more damn<br/>time, I'm gonna lose it.")
('Jiafei', "This one has a long nose, and the eyes are higher up.<br/>They look nothing alike! Moshy's not a knockoff!")
('Jiafei', 'Look at my face. Would this face lie to you?')
('Jiafei', "Heehee. Hey there, young man. Interested in buyin'<br/>some souvenirs?")
('Jiafei', "Got some mega-cheap medicinal herbs, affordable<br/>fortune vases, and other stuff that's exclusive to<br/>my shop!")
('Jiafei', "We've even got Moshy merch in stock! It's all the<br/>rage with the ladies.")
('Jiafei', "Oh, and don't listen to those morons who say he's a<br/>ripoff of some mascot from Crossbell. They're just<br/>tryin' to drag Moshy's good name!")
('Agnès', "(So these things aren't Mishy? But they look<br/>so alike...)")
('Agnès', '(Though I suppose it would be strange for a shop<br/>here to be selling Crossbell theme park goods...)')
('Van', "(Nearly fooled you, didn't he? If he kept his mouth<br/>shut, he might've gotten a sale.)")
('Van', '(Well, you can buy his stuff if you want, but just<br/>know he only sells knockoff goods. Could still be<br/>useful, though.)')
('Jiafei', 'Oooh, I smell an Imperial tourist over there.')
('Jiafei', "Imperials aren't used to Eastern culture, so they make<br/>for good targets—err... I mean, good customers!")
('Heydrich', "As I understand it, there was an incident out here<br/>while I was at the inn. I might've underestimated<br/>yesterday's phenomenon.")
('Heydrich', 'Perhaps I should be getting back home.')
('Heydrich', "It's not like I can do much else here, anyway.<br/>Other than, well, spend money.")
('Heydrich', "I've fallen in love with Eastern culture all over again.<br/>I'm definitely going to come back, and I'll probably<br/>bring a friend with me, too.")
('Heydrich', 'Things got a little strange last night with the mist.<br/>Is this one of the mystical wonders of the East? Is it a<br/>common occurrence here?')
('Heydrich', "Regardless, it was quite the sight. I would have taken<br/>some pictures, but my camera suddenly broke on me.<br/>It's too bad, really.")
('Heydrich', "Oh, well. I've got a treasure trove of stories to tell<br/>when I get home, and that's good enough for me.")
('Heydrich', "I've been spending most of my night talking with this<br/>kind merchant here.")
('Heydrich', "He's been teaching me all about Eastern culture.")
('Heydrich', "And thanks to him, I'm loaded up on medicinal<br/>herbs, and I bought a holy vase for an absurdly<br/>cheap price.")
('Heydrich', 'This Moshy character is awesome! I really hit the<br/>jackpot today!')
('Heydrich', "I feel like I've seen the character before, but the<br/>merchant says it's a hundred percent original. And a<br/>merchant never lies, so it must be true!")
('Heydrich', 'Finally! The Eastern Quarter at last!')
('Heydrich', "This place is beautiful and exotic in all the right ways.<br/>It's a far cry from any town or city in the Empire—<br/>but in a good way!")
('Heydrich', "Though it is a little different from what I expected.<br/>I'd heard the people here had pet pandas.")
('Heydrich', 'I also heard about a festival where folks dressed up<br/>like dragons and danced till sundown.')
('Van', '(Who in the hell fed him that bullcrap?)')
('Heydrich', "Still, my first impression is positive overall. I'm stoked<br/>to finally be here in the flesh!")
('Heydrich', "Now, where can I find a guide? Oh, and I'd love to<br/>visit a souvenir shop, too.")
('Heydrich', "I'd heard that the tour guides were<br/>kimono-wearing women. I've got to find them!")
('Caroline', 'Why are these vegetables soaked in this red...stuff.<br/>What IS this?')
('Caroline', 'Well, whatever this dish is, it certainly<br/>looks appetizing!')
('Qintao', 'Good eye, miss. This is a traditional Eastern<br/>fermented food plate.')
('Qintao', "It's quite the rarity here, so if you're curious, I<br/>definitely recommend buying some.")
('Caroline', "Hmm... It's certainly tempting.")
('Caroline', 'But I might have to pass. The smell is a tad<br/>overbearing for a to-go meal.')
('Van', "Yeah, it's a package deal: weird smell but good taste.")
('Qintao', "I heard there was an incident at the port. That's<br/>not good.")
('Qintao', 'Back-to–back crises will lead to a drop in tourists...')
('Qintao', 'That would be devastating for merchants like me.<br/>We get most of our sales from them.')
('Qintao', "It's hard to believe that some of our own were<br/>murdered on this very street...")
('Qintao', "I even knew the boys who were killed.<br/>Everyone's shaken, including myself.")
('Qintao', "I'll just try to focus on my work. All I can do to help<br/>is make food that will hopefully cheer people up.")
('Qintao', 'Spicy fermented food does especially well during the<br/>evening hours. It pairs well with alcohol.')
('Qintao', "The same can be said of dried fish, which is also on<br/>the menu. Why don't you give it a try?")
('Qintao', 'Welcome, friends!')
('Qintao', 'Were you drawn in by the tantalizing scent of our<br/>fresh Eastern ingredients? One can hardly blame you.')
('Qintao', "I've got this fermented food that's normally only<br/>available in a few regions of the East.")
('Qintao', "It might have an odd smell, but don't let that<br/>fool you. I promise you it's quite addicting.")
('Qintao', 'We handle all sorts of Eastern foods here. If you have<br/>any questions, fire away.')
('Qintao', 'Oh, and if you wish to taste test our dishes before<br/>committing, you are more than welcome to do so!')
('Fuling', 'Last night, an older customer told me a little known<br/>fact, and I think I should share it with you.')
('Fuling', "Everything that's transpired in the last two days has<br/>been eerily similar to the commotion in the Eastern<br/>Quarter forty years ago.")
('Fuling', "Apparently, Heiyue is going to 'handle it,' but I don't<br/>know how. This is all so confusing.")
('Fuling', "Ugh. I'm too scared to go out, but not having a grasp<br/>of the situation is frightening in its own right.")
('Fuling', 'The strange mist left me completely unsettled...<br/>Grandpa never told me about this.')
('Fuling', "In times like these, I normally lock myself in my room<br/>and read a book to calm my nerves, but I think I'll<br/>seek some wisdom from someone older.")
('Fuling', "I thought I was the smartest person in the room, but<br/>the fact that I didn't listen to the words of others<br/>shows that I was the ignorant one...")
('Fuling', "Nighttime here is unbelievably chaotic. Why can't<br/>tourists flock to other towns? Langport isn't the only<br/>place that's representative of the East.")
('Fuling', "For instance, there's Longlai, a village on the eastern<br/>border that is very much like the Far East. The nights<br/>there are evidently quite serene.")
('Fuling', 'Eastern culture is wide and varied. If you believe<br/>Langport encapsulates the East in its entirety, then<br/>your perspective is as shallow as a puddle.')
('Fuling', 'Even a child can be a tourist.')
('Fuling', 'If someone truly has interest in Eastern culture, they<br/>would be better off reading a book if they wish to fill<br/>in their knowledge gaps.')
('Fuling', "Hmph. You're a new face. If any of my books catch<br/>your fancy, feel free to buy them up.")
('Fuling', "The vast majority of the books I inherited from<br/>Grandpa are one of a kind. You won't find them<br/>anywhere else in the world.")
('Fuling', "I've absorbed all the knowledge they have to share.<br/>It's why I'm a great deal more intelligent than anyone<br/>else my age.")
('Fuling', 'If you have any inquiries about Eastern culture, I am<br/>more than happy—and perfectly qualified—to answer<br/>every one of your questions.')
('Antique Seller Jigen', 'Hey, miss. Anything catch your eye?')
('Caroline', "As it so happens, yes! There are all kinds of antiques<br/>here I've never seen in Oración.")
('Feri', 'Oooh, these are really nice! I might grab one or two<br/>of them myself.')
('Antique Seller Jigen', "Glad to hear it. We've got everything from basic<br/>souvenirs to proper antiques.")
('Antique Seller Jigen', "It's all used, but I've put a lot of elbow grease into<br/>restoring 'em all. Let me know if you want any.")
('Antique Seller Jigen', "We'll ship the larger antiques right to your doorstep.")
('Antique Seller Jigen', "That's the least we can do for tourists like you.")
('Antique Seller Jigen', "I couldn't find any info about the mist, but I did learn<br/>an interesting tidbit about something unrelated.")
('Antique Seller Jigen', "Apparently, Heiyue did some covert antiquities<br/>trading recently—utilizing a trade route they don't<br/>normally use.")
('Antique Seller Jigen', "I don't wanna stick my head into their business any<br/>further, but it's eyebrow-raising for sure, especially<br/>after the Harbor District incident.")
('Van', "So Almata wasn't the only one lookin' into antiques...<br/>What the hell is Heiyue up to?")
('Van', 'Thanks for the tip, Jigen. Might be best to steer clear<br/>of this whole affair from here, though.')
('Antique Seller Jigen', "You don't have to tell me twice. I'm not about to go<br/>poking the bear.")
('Antique Seller Jigen', "I love takin' risks, but not when my neck is on<br/>the line.")
('Antique Seller Jigen', "I don't know all the details, but Almata wasn't the<br/>only one looking into the antiques. Heiyue was, too.")
('Antique Seller Jigen', "What in the world could they be plotting? I've got a<br/>bad feeling about this...")
('Antique Seller Jigen', 'Last night was rough. Always hard to hear about<br/>young ones passing on so soon.')
('Antique Seller Jigen', "Not sure what was going on with the mist. I asked the<br/>older folks about it, but they were as silent as<br/>the grave. It's like they know something...")
('Antique Seller Jigen', "Wouldn't surprise me if this is all connected to a<br/>past incident. I'll do some digging.")
('Antique Seller Jigen', 'An antique merchant got beaten to hell and back by<br/>some gangsters at the port.')
('Antique Seller Jigen', "He might just pull out of the biz. Normally, I'd be<br/>fine with less competition, but this just isn't right.")
('Antique Seller Jigen', "Also, if they're targeting antique dealers, I could<br/>be next. I'll have to start sleepin' with one eye open.")
('Antique Seller Jigen', "I'm always dealin' with distributors, and a lot of them<br/>are talkers. Pays to be a good listener.")
('Antique Seller Jigen', "A lot of the info I feed you comes straight from them.<br/>Hopefully it's been of use.")
('Antique Seller Jigen', "Though I haven't been able to kick back and listen<br/>as much. I'm a little under the gun 'cause of those<br/>damn mafia goons.")
('Antique Seller Jigen', "They're putting a lot of pressure on some of us.<br/>Hasn't been fun.")
('Antique Seller Jigen', "Hmph. I'm jealous of you 'free as a bird' types. Wish I<br/>could fly the coop, but if I tried, the old ball and<br/>chain would throw a fit.")
('Antique Seller Jigen', "Speaking of, don't you have family, too? Should you<br/>really be leavin' your kids to fend for themselves?")
('Filenkov', "Oh, I'm not worried about them one bit.<br/>They're perfectly independent.")
('Filenkov', "I think they'd be more annoyed if I wasn't out<br/>and about. They get a kick out of the fun stories and<br/>rare stuff I bring back from my travels.")
('Filenkov', "I'm sure you'd be disappointed if I hung my hat and<br/>rested on my laurels, too. Don't you love hearing<br/>about my adventures?")
('Antique Seller Jigen', "I mean, sure, but what you're doing is still dangerous.")
('Antique Seller Jigen', "And word of advice: you should carve out some more<br/>time for your kids. They're gonna get sick of your<br/>antics eventually.")
('Filenkov', 'Hahaha. You may very well be right.')
('Van', '(I remember seeing this guy at the inn...)')
('Van', "(So he's pals with Jigen, huh?)")
('Tau', 'Where are you guys off to in such a hurry?')
('Tau', "Oh. You're leaving, aren't you? To fight for the city...<br/>and for the people who are gone now...")
('Tau', 'You better come back to us.')
('Tau', "There's still so many things I need you to teach<br/>me, Aaron.")
('Aaron', "Heh. Who the hell do you think I am? I'm not gonna<br/>kick the bucket, so don't worry.")
('Aaron', "I'll be back in a jiff. Once the bad men and women<br/>are toast, you and I can do some training.")
('Tau', "Okay. I'll hold you to that!")
('Tau', 'When I think about what happened yesterday, I get<br/>worried about more people dying...')
('Tau', "But I know you won't lose, Aaron. I believe in you!")
('Tau', "Now go beat up those bad guys! Show them that you<br/>don't mess with us!")
('Tau', "I can't believe it. Huang and the other guys<br/>are...gone? It can't be!")
('Tau', "They were so strong. This just doesn't feel real...")
('Tau', "But that's all the more reason why I have to train.<br/>Someone has to protect this town...and Xin.")
('Tau', "I won't stop pushing myself until I'm on the same<br/>level as Aaron!")
('Tau', "Oh, hi, Aaron! I heard about what went down in the<br/>Harbor District. I wish I got to see you kick those<br/>guys' butts!")
('Aaron', "You didn't miss much. I pulverized them in no time<br/>at all.")
('Aaron', "Even you could've beat them with one hand tied<br/>behind your back.")
('Tau', "I-I don't know about that. I'm sure you could pull<br/>that off, but I'm nowhere near as tough as you.")
('Tau', "But I want to be someday. That's why, umm...I'd like<br/>to train with you again—when you're not busy,<br/>of course!")
('Aaron', "Sure thing. Got some stuff to take care of, but after<br/>that, I'm down to spar.")
('Aaron', 'Until then, you can just review the notes you took<br/>when you were watching me do my fancy moves.')
('Van', '(He did what now? Man, this kid practically worships<br/>the ground he walks on...)')
('Tau', 'I should ask Aaron for some pointers. He knows<br/>martial arts, and everyone looks up to him.')
('Tau', "I'm going to become just as strong as him one day.<br/>Then I'll definitely be able to protect the city<br/>with Xin.")
('Tau', 'Maybe Aaron would be willing to train with<br/>me again...')
('Tau', "Aaron and I go to the same Gekka school, so I've<br/>been able to see him in action.")
('Tau', "He's mainly a swordsman, but he's a master of<br/>unarmed martial arts, too. He's also a great teacher!")
('Tau', "Hmm... My dojo instructor told me that while I'm on<br/>the right track, I need to take another step forward on<br/>my own.")
('Tau', "I've got to search within myself and find the path only<br/>I can take.")
('Tau', "If I want to support Xin, I have to become a Gekka<br/>school martial artist. He's been hitting the books<br/>abroad, so I'll have to work hard, too.")
('Feri', "(He's studying Gekka? Wow. It's cool to see that<br/>Calvardians are studying Eastern martial arts.)")
('Van', "(He mentioned the name Xin, didn't he?)")
('Van', '(Probably talking about the kid from the Lu Family.<br/>Interesting.)')
('Tau', "Xin's around the same age as me, but he's already got<br/>his path figured out. He knows he's going to be the<br/>future elder.")
('Tau', "I heard he used to be a snot-nosed brat, but he's<br/>grown up since then.")
('Tau', "Can't wait for him to get back from his study trip!")
('Pao', "You and Aaron are the most dependable youngsters<br/>I've seen in a very long time.")
('Pao', "Don't let the sins of the past hang over you. Just look<br/>forward and do what you must to protect our city.")
('Pao', 'I hope you take that to heart, Aaron. Stay calm and<br/>face that which lies ahead.')
('Pao', 'I believe you can overcome this without<br/>losing yourself.')
('Pao', "I-I can't believe it... I never thought I'd live to see this<br/>all happen again...")
('Van', "Uhh. You okay, Pao? It's pretty rare to see you freak<br/>out like this.")
('Pao', "I-I'm all right. I was just caught up thinking about<br/>the past. That's all.")
('Pao', "I've seen that mist a long time ago—during a very<br/>dark chapter in my life.")
('Van', 'That why you and the older people around here are<br/>all out of it? Did something happen back then?')
('Pao', "I... Well, you see...it's not my place to tell you,<br/>I'm afraid. Please forgive me.")
('Van', "(The hell? Why's she bein' so tight-lipped<br/>about this?)")
('Pao', "Now that I think about it, though, he's...very<br/>much like...")
('Pao', "No, I must be wrong. I'm letting my anxieties get the<br/>best of me.")
('Pao', 'Sorry, I think reminiscing about that time in my life<br/>is giving rise to some irrational thoughts.')
('Pao', "I can't believe I doubted that child for even<br/>a moment. It's utterly shameful.")
('Pao', 'I must go to the temple and meditate. Perhaps that<br/>will ease my troubled heart.')
('Pao', "I know you're intimately familiar with the<br/>Eastern Quarter...")
('Pao', '...but its storied history holds many secrets.')
('Pao', "Secrets that even the citizens aren't privy to.")
('Pao', 'It may behoove you to look to its past someday.<br/>I think you will find some points of interest.')
('Pao', "Well, if it isn't Aaron. I didn't know you were friends<br/>with Van.")
('Pao', "Though I shouldn't be surprised. You get along with<br/>just about everyone.")
('Aaron', "Nah, you got it wrong. I'm just following him around<br/>to see what kinda stupid crap he gets into.")
('Aaron', "Anyway, shouldn't you be heading on inside?<br/>It's getting kinda late.")
('Aaron', "I know you're just looking after the town and its<br/>people, but my bros and I have got that covered.")
('Pao', "You boys are certainly dependable. We didn't have<br/>people like you back when I was running the inn, so I<br/>had to watch over the town by myself.")
('Pao', "I'll take your advice, though, since things have been<br/>getting rather dangerous as of late. The town is in<br/>safe hands with you on the prowl.")
('Pao', "Be a good friend to Aaron, Van. I've been watching<br/>him since he was a child, and despite the trouble he<br/>causes, he's a kind boy at heart.")
('Van', "I'll take your word for it.")
('Van', "And hey, I'd love to get along with him if I could.")
('Aaron', 'Yeah, not happening.')
('Pao', "I've been watching Aaron since he was a small child.<br/>He's always been a rebel, but he's very kind and has<br/>many friends supporting him.")
('Pao', 'He also had a mother who truly loved him...')
('Pao', 'I know he can look after himself, but I still worry<br/>about him sometimes. Everyone needs a guiding hand<br/>in their lives.')
('Pao', 'Van? Is that really you?')
('Pao', "Oh, it's been much too long! Have you gotten taller?<br/>You have, haven't you?")
('Van', "I, uh, don't think so. It wasn't that long ago since I<br/>last dropped by.")
('Agnès', "Who's this nice lady, Van?")
('Van', 'This is Pao. She helped me big time when I was just<br/>starting out.')
('Van', "She ran an inn back in the day, but she closed it down.<br/>How's retirement treatin' you?")
('Pao', "Quite well, in fact. It's nice to take things easy<br/>for once.")
('Pao', 'Though I still lend an ear to those in need. I rather<br/>enjoy helping the young ones along their journey.')
('Feri', "You sound just like someone I know. There's a wise<br/>old lady in a village near mine.")
('Feri', "Heehee. Makes me feel warm and fuzzy knowing<br/>there's other people just like her.")
('Pao', 'I appreciate you bringing the case to a swift end.<br/>Thank you for all your help.')
('Pao', "Sounds like your fixer business is panning out nicely.<br/>Here's hoping you have many bright years ahead<br/>of you!")
('Pao', "If you're on the case, then Neil's got nothing to fear.")
('Pao', 'I appreciate you for looking out for him.')
('Pao', 'Have you had a chance to check the bulletin board?')
('Pao', "There's something I'd like to talk to you about...")
('Van', "What's up? You have a request for me?")
('Van', "I actually haven't checked it yet, sorry. Let me do that<br/>real quick.")
('Pao', "I ran an inn for fifty years, so I've met people of all<br/>walks of life.")
('Pao', 'Many immigrants from the East came to my humble<br/>establishment back then. They felt alone and isolated,<br/>which is why I helped guide them along.')
('Pao', 'Hopefully my presence in their lives was a small<br/>comfort to them.')
('Neil', "*sigh* I'm so dead...")
('Neil', "I can't believe I'm being hunted by Heiyue.<br/>Where did my life go so wrong?")
('Neil', 'You guys are my only hope. Please save me!')
('Haifeng', "I assume you're looking into last night's incident?")
('Aaron', "Damn right I am. I'm not waiting for Heiyue's slow<br/>ass to move.")
('Aaron', "I'm gonna go out there and settle this whether you<br/>guys act or not.")
('Haifeng', 'I thought as much.')
('Haifeng', "Well, I haven't received any orders to stop you, so I<br/>won't stand in your way.")
('Haifeng', 'However, I will issue a warning.')
('Haifeng', "Heiyue never stays its hand without reason. If they<br/>aren't making any moves, it's because the elders<br/>already have a play in mind.")
('Aaron', '...Thanks for the heads up.')
('Aaron', "But I don't give a shit about what they're up to.<br/>It's got nothing to do with my plan to avenge<br/>my bros.")
('Haifeng', 'Understood. I respect your resolve.')
('Haifeng', 'Then do what you must, Aaron.')
('Van', '(Why would the elders not want to act? We should<br/>get to the bottom of this.)')
('Haifeng', "I'm merely an escort, so my opinion doesn't count<br/>for much.")
('Haifeng', "But I don't care for the way the current elders deal<br/>with Aaron. It's worrying.")
('Haifeng', 'At least Fan expects good things from him.')
('Haifeng', "It pains my heart to hear about what happened to<br/>Aaron's friends...")
('Haifeng', "I can't provide any specifics, but according to<br/>Heiyue's investigation, they suffered<br/>unnatural deaths.")
('Haifeng', "We're currently strengthening our security in light of<br/>this event.")
('Haifeng', 'After last night, Heiyue decided to strengthen<br/>its security.')
('Haifeng', 'I will do everything I can to protect the Lu family.')
('Haifeng', "I've heard Aaron is looking to get revenge...<br/>I understand how he's feeling, but I fear he will act<br/>recklessly, should he walk this path.")
('Haifeng', 'Looks like Fan has come home for once.')
('Haifeng', "If you have anything to discuss with him, now's<br/>the time.")
('Haifeng', 'Good evening, Aaron. I heard about your recent<br/>exploits at the port.')
('Haifeng', 'Everyone in Heiyue is impressed with your natural<br/>talents and leadership abilities. I hope you will<br/>consider joining us in the future.')
('Aaron', "Hard pass. Being tied down to an organization isn't<br/>really my thing.")
('Aaron', 'And just when the elders finally stop pushing the<br/>invites down my throat...')
('Haifeng', '...I apologize for speaking out of turn.')
('Haifeng', 'Well, you do have plenty of time to change<br/>your mind.')
('Haifeng', 'The elders expect great things from you.')
('Haifeng', "We're all expecting great things from you, Aaron.")
('Haifeng', "But if you wish to follow your own path, I'll respect<br/>that decision.")
('Haifeng', "Greetings. You're Arkride Solutions, yes? I've heard<br/>much about you from Fan.")
('Haifeng', "This is the Lu family's mansion. What brings you<br/>here today?")
('Van', "Oh, nothing in particular. Just wanderin' around.")
('Haifeng', "Is that so? Well, if there's anything I can help you<br/>with, please let me know.")
('Haifeng', "Fan is rarely at home, so if you have a message for<br/>him, I'd be happy to deliver it for you.")
('Haifeng', 'By the way, I apologize for tailing you earlier.')
('Haifeng', "We had to ensure Lady Ashen's safety. Fan's orders.")
('Haifeng', "Those measures may seem drastic, but they're<br/>absolutely necessary. I will do what I must to<br/>protect her.")
('Fan', 'Aaron may be reluctant to join Heiyue, but I truly<br/>believe that when the time comes, he shall step up to<br/>the plate and lead us.')
('Fan', 'I have faith that he will one day look inward and<br/>realize his true calling.')
('Fan', 'Just like my son did.')
('Fan', "Well, well. If it isn't Arkride. I heard from my<br/>daughter that you met Aaron.")
('Fan', 'We apologize that your encounter with him was<br/>so...combative.')
('Ashen', 'Aaron can be quite intemperate sometimes, not to<br/>mention stubborn.')
('Van', 'Yeah, I got that much from our fight.')
('Van', 'His strength is the real deal, though. I can see why<br/>you guys struggle to rein him in.')
('Ashen', "I promise you that he's not a bad guy at all. Just a<br/>little rough around the edges.")
('Ashen', "He's always looking after his friends, and—while he'll<br/>never admit it to your face—he is very kind to the<br/>children and the elderly.")
('Fan', "It's just as she says. Were it not for those qualities, we<br/>wouldn't put so much faith in him.")
('Fan', 'He also has a vast array of knowledge and possesses<br/>great leadership skills—which will serve him well<br/>should he become an elder of Heiyue.')
('Fan', 'My eldest son wishes to climb the ladder of Heiyue,<br/>so he desires those attributes. That is why he is<br/>studying abroad as we speak.')
('Van', "Got'cha. Well, don't worry about Aaron and me.<br/>I never judge a book by its cover.")
('Van', 'Gotta at least make it to the midpoint before I make<br/>a call.')
('Van', "And it looks like I'll have a chance to get a good, long<br/>look at him and his actions soon.")
('Fan', "Haha. It's just as I heard. You may seem brash on the<br/>surface, but you're actually very observant.")
('Fan', 'Well, then. I shall leave this matter in your<br/>capable hands.')
('Ashen', "Heiyue hasn't caught wind of where the attackers<br/>from last night are lurking. At least, not as far as<br/>I know.")
('Ashen', "Personally, I'm willing to bet the elders have figured<br/>something out.")
('Ashen', "But in case I'm wrong, I'm going to lay out all the<br/>information I have on hand and try to come to the<br/>conclusion myself.")
('Ashen', 'If you guys find them before us, then be careful,<br/>all right?')
('Ashen', 'If you would, please watch over Aaron in my stead.<br/>Also, while this is just my opinion...')
('Ashen', "...I get the feeling that if you and Aaron work<br/>together on something, you'll get along quite well.")
('Syd', '...')
('Aaron', "(Syd... I promise I'll get revenge for you...and the rest<br/>of the bros.)")
('Aaron', '(So hurry and wake up already...please. I wanna be<br/>able to tell you about how I beat their asses down.)')
('Syd', '...')
('Eastern Medicine Dr. Longkai', 'I promise to keep him alive until we can get him to<br/>the hospital. Heiyue has already contacted them.')
('Eastern Medicine Dr. Longkai', 'In return, I only ask that you keep Aaron company.')
('Syd', 'Man, that was refreshing as hell!')
('Syd', "We really showed those gangsters and outsiders that<br/>we mean business. Aaron must've had them quaking<br/>in their boots!")
('Syd', 'Shame that blonde chick had to ruin it all.<br/>Things were just about to get interesting.')
('Syd', "We're gonna wait around and kill time.")
('Syd', "Aaron's never done us wrong. Following that guy<br/>always leads to some interesting shit.")
('Syd', "Damn those punks. They think they can get one over<br/>us with surprise ambushes? Well, I'll show them!")
('Syd', "I'm gonna catch their asses and wipe those stupid<br/>grins off their faces! I'mma make Aaron proud!")
('Syd', "I gotta handle this on my own—or I'll never be able<br/>to look him in the eye again.")
('Ouran', 'The strange mist last night reminded me of the<br/>darkest days of my life...')
('Ouran', 'The most awful memories will stalk you wherever you<br/>go...and they will only give up the chase once you<br/>enter the grave.')
('Ouran', "I remember that mist all too well...and it's reared its<br/>ugly head into our lives once more...")
('Ouran', 'When it appeared back then, many of us lost so many<br/>things we held dear...')
('Ouran', 'Will history repeat itself? Has it come to take even<br/>more from us? When will it ever be satisfied?')
('Ouran', 'I had no trouble finding work after quitting the<br/>mining job.')
('Ouran', 'Trade and finance were on the rise at the time, so<br/>there were all sorts of carrier jobs available.')
('Ouran', 'It replaced the mining business here, and thus the<br/>mine was drowned in the ever-changing tide of<br/>the economy.')
('Ouran', 'That place held a great many memories, so perhaps<br/>that is why I was saddled with regrets...')
('Aaron', "You still out here being all melancholic, Ouran?<br/>That's not gonna put a smile on your old lady's<br/>face, y'know.")
('Ouran', "Blunt as ever, aren't you, Aaron? Still, your words<br/>ring true.")
('Ouran', "The fact that I'm chained down by the past must be<br/>filling her with sorrow, but I want her to look down<br/>on me with pride.")
('Ouran', 'Perhaps if I had that endless vitality of yours, I could<br/>rid myself of these shackles and be free once more.')
('Aaron', "You're waxing poetic more than usual, which means<br/>something's troubling you. What's on your mind?")
('Ouran', "Hmph. Can't hide a thing from you, can I?")
('Ouran', "I've been consumed with worry—over things like<br/>losing everything that's ever been important to me...<br/>once again.")
('Aaron', "C'mon, not this again. You need to kick back, relax,<br/>and enjoy the years you got left. Leave the worrying<br/>to my generation.")
('Aaron', "If hell breaks loose in this town, we'll be the ones to<br/>shut its gates.")
('Aaron', "I've got no idea about what went down with you and<br/>your job back in the day, but I say let it go and do<br/>whatever the hell you want now.")
('Ouran', "Heh. You've got a lot of nerve.")
('Ouran', "You're absolutely right, though. I can't let the<br/>memories of the past tie me down.")
('Ouran', "Aaron's words are sharper than any blade, but I<br/>respect his willingness to lay into us older folks.")
('Ouran', 'We may whine about it from time to time, but<br/>sometimes, we need a dose of bitter truth to make the<br/>pain go away.')
('Ouran', 'He may be immature, but we know he means well.')
('Ouran', "*sigh* The salty breeze reminds me of that mine...<br/>I think I'm the only one left who remembers it.")
('Ouran', "Looking back, my job there was tough as nails, but I<br/>wouldn't've met my wife had it not been for<br/>that place.")
('Ouran', "I'll never forget about it, no matter how many decades<br/>pass me by. It's where I spent much of my youth.")
('Agnès', "(I didn't know Langport had a mine. I thought it was<br/>just a trading city.)")
('Van', '(Well, there used to be a mine here way back when.)')
('Van', '(But it was shut down and sealed away. No clue why<br/>that happened.)')
('Ouran', 'Back when the mine was still around, I was young<br/>and filled with hopes and dreams.')
('Ouran', 'I worked there so I could earn and save money. I was<br/>hoping I could make a name for myself one day.')
('Ouran', 'In the end, however, I lost everything...')
('Ferryman Shou', "We're holding off on reopening tours for a<br/>while longer.")
('Ferryman Shou', "After hearing about the incident at the port, I decided<br/>it'd be best to prioritize the people's safety, even if we<br/>lose money in the short run.")
('Ferryman Shou', "But I don't have any issues with renting a boat to<br/>you guys. Just say the word, and the keys are yours.")
('Ferryman Shou', "Plans to jumpstart the tour business again<br/>were halted. We've got a mountain of issues to deal<br/>with because of last night.")
('Ferryman Shou', 'Heiyue put me in charge of tourist safety, so how we<br/>proceed with the rental business is up to me...')
('Ferryman Shou', "How's it going, Aaron? It's rare to see you doing the<br/>night rounds with an outsider.")
('Aaron', "I'm just curious about how this guy runs his business.")
('Aaron', "Kinda surprised to see you here so late at night.<br/>When'd you become such a hard worker?")
('Ferryman Shou', 'When Heiyue put me in charge, of course.')
('Ferryman Shou', "That said, the Eroded Cave is dangerous at night, so<br/>there won't be any more tours today.")
('Ferryman Shou', "Unless you want to take a trip there. I'll always make<br/>an exception for a tough guy like you.")
('Aaron', 'Cool. When I get some free time, I might head over<br/>there to train.')
('Ferryman Shou', 'A long time ago, I took Aaron to the Eroded Cave<br/>because he wanted to test his abilities...')
('Ferryman Shou', '...and I was captivated by the way he fought.')
('Ferryman Shou', "Heiyue's never happy when an incident occurs in the<br/>Eroded Cave. Hurts their bottom line.")
('Ferryman Shou', "Things get dangerous there at night, so for my sake,<br/>don't even think about going there right now.")
('Ferryman Shou', "Oh, you guys the problem solvers I've heard about?")
('Ferryman Shou', 'You look tough. I get why Heiyue has their eye<br/>on you.')
('Agnès', "Wait, you're a part of Heiyue?")
('Ferryman Shou', "Not exactly. I'm just a simple ferryman.")
('Ferryman Shou', "But us guides don't want tourists wandering off in the<br/>wrong places and causing trouble—and neither<br/>do they.")
('Ferryman Shou', "So we work together to some degree. It's a mutually<br/>beneficial arrangement.")
('Van', "Draw a distinction all you like, but the way I see it,<br/>you're a Heiyue member through and through.")
('Van', "Your job's to look out for spies disguised as tourists<br/>and serve as a liaison between Heiyue and people who<br/>wanna contact them.")
('Ferryman Shou', "You're well informed. Still, I do this work in part to<br/>prevent tourist trouble on the ocean—of which there<br/>is plenty.")
('Ferryman Shou', 'And I usually end up involved with any requests on<br/>that end.')
('Caroline', 'Now, this is a fine boat. Are we able to rent it?')
('Ferryman Shou', 'You can, yeah.')
('Ferryman Shou', 'Tourists like you typically use it to see the<br/>Eroded Cave.')
('Ferryman Shou', "Unfortunately, there's been a little bit of trouble<br/>there, so tours to that place are on pause.")
('Caroline', 'Aww... What a shame.')
('Feri', '(He has to be talking about his request.)')
('Van', "(It's gonna be a while till the monsters withdraw from<br/>the cave.)")
('Van', "(Don't think we have time to handle it, though.)")
('Feri', "(He's talking about his request, right?)")
('Van', "(Yeah. If we have time, let's help out later.)")
('Feri', '(What kind of trouble is he talking about?)')
('Van', "(Pretty curious myself, to be honest. When we finish<br/>this request, let's try asking him.)")
('Ferryman Shou', 'Sorry, but the Eroded Cave tours are currently<br/>on hold.')
('Ferryman Shou', 'Tours around this area are fair game, though.')
('Ferryman Shou', 'There are many interesting sights to see in Langport,<br/>such as the Eroded Cave.')
('Ferryman Shou', "It's my job to guide people who want to go to<br/>those places...")
('Ferryman Shou', "...as well as veer them away from areas they<br/>shouldn't enter.")
('Houseman', "Your vehicle's in the best of hands, I assure you.")
('Houseman', "I've been doing this job since before you youngins<br/>were in diapers.")
('Houseman', "I'll leave her better than you found her.")
('Manager Hairen', "...The members of the theater are in mourning after<br/>last night's incident.")
('Manager Hairen', "We're putting together a performance of<br/>remembrance in honor of those boys.")
('Manager Hairen', "It's said that the spring lily grows deep within the<br/>Eroded Cave.")
('Manager Hairen', 'If you all end up going there, please look for it.')
('Manager Hairen', "...Although, I suppose there's little reason for anyone<br/>to head there under these circumstances.")
('Manager Hairen', "We managed to conclude this morning's<br/>performances without incident...")
('Manager Hairen', "I'm glad people were able to enjoy them as usual.")
('Manager Hairen', "There's no need for you to be concerned with<br/>us, Aaron. Do what you need to do.")
('Aaron', "I wasn't worried about you in the first place.")
('Aaron', "You guys aren't the types to lose heart so easily.")
('Manager Hairen', 'Heh. True enough, I suppose.')
('Manager Hairen', 'We all want to see you on the stage again soon...')
('Manager Hairen', "...so promise me you'll make it back safely.")
('Aaron', "Sure thing. I'm already itching to make my<br/>grand return.")
('Manager Hairen', 'I know you have things to take care of...')
('Manager Hairen', "...but we believe that when you finish your business,<br/>you'll come back to the stage and take the world by<br/>storm once more!")
('Manager Hairen', "I'm still in shock over what happened to<br/>Aaron's friends...")
('Manager Hairen', 'Those boys used to come by this place all the time...')
('Manager Hairen', "I considered canceling our performances for today,<br/>but...I don't believe they would want that. They loved<br/>our theater more than anyone.")
('Manager Hairen', 'We will do our utmost to put on the greatest shows<br/>this theater has ever seen. That is the best way we can<br/>honor their memory.')
('Manager Hairen', 'You did an exceptional job this afternoon, Aaron.<br/>Although, I would appreciate it if you shared the<br/>spotlight with your peers next time.')
('Aaron', "Sorry, but that isn't how I roll. We've been over this.")
('Aaron', 'My presence gets asses into seats, and my acting<br/>makes the crowd go wild. What more do you want?')
('Manager Hairen', "*sigh* You've got me there, I suppose.")
('Manager Hairen', "You're equally as talented as your mother, yet your<br/>skillset differs greatly from hers. That's part of what<br/>makes you so fascinating.")
('Manager Hairen', 'The final performance of the day is coming up.<br/>Our actors will likely be playing to a full house.')
('Manager Hairen', 'Many of our guests have been from out of town as<br/>of late.')
('Manager Hairen', 'Having our culture and traditions accepted and<br/>embraced by others is truly a joyous thing.')
('Manager Hairen', "I hope you enjoyed today's show. Everyone always<br/>comes away with big smiles whenever Aaron is part of<br/>the cast.")
('Manager Hairen', 'He is an understudy for that particular role, but his<br/>popularity exceeds that of the main actor.')
('Manager Hairen', "While I don't particularly care for his excessive ad<br/>libs, I can't deny he is an excellent performer.")
('Manager Hairen', 'His appearances are sparse, however, so anyone who<br/>gets to see him on stage should count<br/>themselves lucky.')
('Manager Hairen', 'Eastern theater may be a cultural tradition with a<br/>storied history, but its dazzling choreography and<br/>vibrant performances give it a modern feel.')
('Manager Hairen', "I believe that's why it's so popular among young<br/>people today.")
('Manager Hairen', 'Aaron is a shining star amidst his generation.<br/>Actors like him are hard to come by.')
('Lince', 'All the young members of the troupe were able to<br/>give it their all earlier.')
('Lince', 'Even in the midst of a tragedy, we still have to<br/>entertain our audience—to give them a reprieve from<br/>the harshness of reality.')
('Lince', "That's why I'm so proud of everyone here.")
('Lince', "...If you're worried about us, Aaron, don't be.<br/>Just come back to us safely, all right?")
('Lince', "I just can't believe those kids are gone now...<br/>They used to come here quite a lot...")
('Lince', "I hope Aaron's okay. He loved them all like family...")
('Lince', "Fancy seeing you here, Aaron. I can't remember the<br/>last time I saw you show up twice in one day.")
('Aaron', "Well, I'm not here to perform, so sorry if I got your<br/>hopes up. I found some other entertainment for<br/>the night.")
('Aaron', "But if the mood strikes me, I'll drop by and take the<br/>stage again.")
('Lince', "Oh, right. I forgot that you are normally 'busy'<br/>at night. Or rather, 'occupied' might be the more<br/>accurate term.")
('Lince', 'Either way, you should consider stopping by if<br/>you can. The last time you performed at night, the<br/>crowd was in love with you.')
('Lince', 'You were especially popular with middle-aged men.')
('Aaron', "Wait, for real? I mean...of course I was! I'm loved by<br/>all types.")
('Lince', "All that's left is today's final show. We'll end it all<br/>with a bang.")
('Lince', 'Our theater is usually packed with older guests late at<br/>night, so the content of the production is more<br/>mature to match.')
('Lince', 'Being able to adjust your performance to suit the<br/>tastes and preferences of your present audience is the<br/>mark of a true professional.')
('Lince', "Aaron was as impressive as ever. It might've even<br/>been his best performance yet.")
('Lince', "I've been in this industry for over ten years, but when<br/>he first came here and showed his stuff, even I<br/>became self-conscious.")
('Lince', 'His movements were precise and graceful, and his<br/>acting ability would put most professionals to shame.')
('Lince', 'If he became a full-fledged member and polished his<br/>skills further, he would soar to greater heights than<br/>we could ever imagine.')
('Lince', 'Male performers playing female characters is a<br/>practice that has existed for many, many years.')
('Lince', "Aaron likes doing it—and he's become quite popular<br/>as a result.")
('Kan', 'People were raving about my sword dance.')
('Kan', 'I just tried following my instincts this time, and I<br/>ended up performing better than usual.')
('Kan', "I'm finally ready to challenge you, Aaron. So don't go<br/>and get yourself hurt out there!")
('Aaron', "...All right, tough guy. You're on.")
('Aaron', "Till then, keep practicing. You'll need to if you wanna<br/>beat me.")
('Kan', "I've finally found my own way of sword dancing.")
('Kan', "That's why I wanna challenge Aaron again—and this<br/>time, I'll win!")
('Kan', "We're all down—but we're not out. I'm gonna<br/>perform my heart out because that's what those guys<br/>would've wanted me to do.")
('Kan', "I'm not sure if Aaron's ever going to perform again<br/>after what happened last night...")
('Kan', "...so I'm going to sword dance in his stead. This is<br/>where us pros have to show our stuff!")
('Kan', 'I heard about the fight at the dock.')
('Kan', "Glad to see you didn't get injured. I bet that Gekka<br/>style came in handy.")
('Kan', 'Speaking of which, is your sword dancing based on<br/>your swordsmanship?')
('Aaron', "That's random.")
('Aaron', 'Well, I guess I never really thought about it. I just<br/>follow my instincts when I dance.')
('Aaron', "I haven't been to the Gekka dojo in ages, so if my<br/>moves are influenced by it, then it's all ingrained.")
('Kan', 'Ugh. Your natural talent is on another level.')
('Kan', "But that's all the more reason why I need to polish my<br/>skills as much as possible.")
('Kan', "I'm gonna surpass you one of these days. Just<br/>you wait!")
('Aaron', 'Heh. Good luck with that, bud.')
('Kan', 'I heard Aaron took care of a bunch of<br/>good-for-nothings again.')
('Kan', 'He must have downed them all with his Gekka style.')
('Kan', '...Wait, is that where he learned his sword<br/>dancing techniques? If I learned swordsmanship,<br/>would I be able to dance as well as him?')
('Kan', 'I should ask him about that later, but for now, I gotta<br/>focus on the performance ahead of me.')
('Kan', "I hate to admit it, but Aaron's talent is the real deal.")
('Kan', "He isn't even an official member of the troupe, and<br/>he's already left me in the dust. Guess that means I'm<br/>not pushing myself hard enough...")
('Kan', "But I'll show him up one of these days! I'm gonna<br/>watch him even closer than before so I can absorb all<br/>his skills!")
('Receptionist Fuuka', 'U-Umm... E-Excuse me, Aaron!')
('Receptionist Fuuka', "A-About your friends... I'm... I-I'm...")
('Aaron', "Still freezing up, eh? Well, I know what you're trying<br/>to say. Thanks.")
('Aaron', "And don't worry about me, all right? I'm gonna be<br/>gone for a bit, but I'll be back. That's a promise.")
('Aaron', "...Although, I dunno if I'll be able to take the stage<br/>the same way I used to.")
('Receptionist Fuuka', 'A-Aaron...')
('Receptionist Fuuka', '...')
('Receptionist Fuuka', 'Aaron! I-I, umm... I believe in you!')
('Aaron', 'Hah. Finally managed to get the words out.')
('Aaron', "That's one less thing for me to worry about.")
('Receptionist Fuuka', "I don't know what you're leaving for—and it's<br/>certainly not my place to ask.")
('Receptionist Fuuka', "But I'll hold you to your promise. Please come back to<br/>us safe and sound!")
('Receptionist Fuuka', 'The performers are working extra hard to cheer up<br/>the locals.')
('Receptionist Fuuka', "And Amalia's been thinking about starting up her fan<br/>club so she can share some positivity.")
('Receptionist Fuuka', "They're all so amazing—unlike me. I'm just so<br/>worried about Aaron, I can't think of anything else...")
('Receptionist Fuuka', 'Welcome! How ma—A-A-Aaron?!')
('Receptionist Fuuka', 'Ah, umm... Uhh...')
('Van', "Well, that's one way to greet your guests. Last time I<br/>was here, you were a bit more chill.")
('Aaron', "This girl's one of my many fans, but she's a cut above<br/>the rest. Took things to the next level by getting a<br/>job here.")
('Aaron', "I don't talk with her much, but when I do, it's pretty<br/>damn entertaining.")
('Receptionist Fuuka', 'A-Ah... C-Can I help y-you, sir?')
('Receptionist Fuuka', 'D-Do you want to talk to the manager or something?')
('Receptionist Fuuka', "I'll d-do anything for you, A-Aaron!")
('Receptionist Fuuka', "Today's final performance is about to begin.<br/>Our night shows are usually packed.")
('Receptionist Fuuka', "That's partially because we have many regulars like<br/>Amalia who see multiple shows a day.")
('Receptionist Fuuka', "She's planning to start up a fan club on the orbal net<br/>to create an online community for our theater.")
('Receptionist Fuuka', "It's an ingenious idea! Amalia is so inventive.")
('Receptionist Fuuka', "Welcome! The last show was incredible, wasn't it?")
('Receptionist Fuuka', "I've been working on staff for a year now, but I'm still<br/>SO excited to be here! I've loved each and every<br/>production this theater has put on!")
('Receptionist Fuuka', 'When I was just a fan, the thought of seeing the<br/>performers backstage was just an idle pipe dream—<br/>but now I get to do it every day!')
('Receptionist Fuuka', 'And sometimes I even get a peek at Aaron!<br/>Every time I see his gorgeous face, my heart skips<br/>a beat! *swoon*')
('Agnès', "(Aww... She has a crush on Aaron. That's so sweet!)")
('Van', "(That guy's every bit the ladykiller I've heard...)")
('Receptionist Fuuka', '*cough* A-Anyway, I love Eastern theater from the<br/>bottom of my heart, which is why I work here.')
('Receptionist Fuuka', "I want the whole world to know about it—and that's<br/>why I'd be delighted if you purchased some of our<br/>anniversary goods.")
('Receptionist Fuuka', 'Buy some for your friends and spread the love.')
('Amalia', "The performers went all out for this morning's show.<br/>They poured their hearts and souls into it.")
('Amalia', 'I could feel their impassioned spirits...as well as their<br/>desire to share their radiant energy with everyone in<br/>the Eastern Quarter.')
('Amalia', "We—the audience—and they—the performers—<br/>truly became one, and that's a sensation you can only<br/>get in the theater.")
('Amalia', "The performers are all thinking of ways to raise<br/>people's spirits after last night...")
('Amalia', "They really have an amazing strength of spirit.<br/>That might be why they're always able to put on such<br/>spectacular performances.")
('Amalia', "Maybe it's insensitive for me to think about the fan<br/>club idea now, but...I really want to spread those<br/>positive vibes to the people that need them.")
('Amalia', "I can't wait for the show tonight. It's always a treat to<br/>see the more provocative productions this place<br/>puts on.")
('Amalia', "I'm lucky that I can come here whenever I want.<br/>People who live outside of Langport don't have<br/>that privilege.")
('Amalia', 'If only there was some way they could be part of the<br/>experience, too...')
('Amalia', "Wait, I know! I'll make a fan club on the orbal net.<br/>We can create a nice, wholesome community of fans<br/>all over the continent.")
('Amalia', 'Phew... Another breathtaking show!')
('Amalia', "One of the reasons I love theater is that I get to share<br/>the same space with the performers. It's like I become<br/>a part of their world.")
('Amalia', "Fuuka gets me there. We're both theater geeks, so<br/>after every show, I drop by to share my impressions<br/>with her.")
('Wuhan', "After last night, I realized I gotta protect what's<br/>precious to me—and that's this store.")
('Wuhan', "The Eastern Quarter's been through some tough<br/>times, but my predecessors always pulled through and<br/>kept the store up and runnin'.")
('Wuhan', "And they passed the torch to me, so I'm gonna make<br/>darn sure I carry it to the end! I'll make sure this place<br/>never closes down!")
('Wuhan', '*sigh* I got all nervous again when I was asked to<br/>chase people away this morning.')
('Wuhan', "How the heck did those assassins sneak in here<br/>without me knowin'?")
('Wuhan', "I'm always gonna be thankful to Heiyue for lookin'<br/>out for this old place...")
('Wuhan', "...but I won't lie. It felt like my heart stopped for a sec<br/>when I caught a glimpse of Master Gien pretending<br/>to be a servant.")
('Wuhan', "Whew. Sorry for bein' all anxious earlier<br/>this afternoon. Just a bout of the jitters, that's all.")
('Wuhan', "So what's the word? You takin' a nighttime stroll<br/>through town?")
('Wuhan', "Don't blame ya. It gets nice and lively at night.<br/>Plenty of ways to have some fun.")
('Wuhan', "Be sure to stay away from those outsider punks,<br/>though, y'hear? They've been poppin' up here<br/>more lately.")
('Wuhan', "Things've gotten mighty dangerous 'round<br/>these parts. You better watch your back out there.")
('Wuhan', "Oh, you got Aaron with ya? Never mind, then.<br/>You're as safe as a baby in a crib.")
('Wuhan', "That boy'll beat the snot outta any scumbag who<br/>wishes you ill will.")
('Wuhan', "No one's gonna harm a hair on your head with him<br/>by your side. He's a tough lad.")
('Aaron', "That's right. Praise me more.")
('Aaron', "As long as I'm in town, you guys have nothing to<br/>worry about.")
('Wuhan', "Things've gotten dangerous lately, but if Aaron's with<br/>you, you'll be as safe as a bird in a cage.")
('Wuhan', 'I heard he chased those outsider punks right<br/>outta town.')
('Wuhan', "And good riddance to 'em!")
('Wuhan', 'O-Oh, you heading out?')
('Wuhan', 'Take care, then.')
('Wuhan', 'I-If you have any questions, just...lemme know.')
('Van', '(He seems weirdly on edge.)')
('Van', "(Or maybe he's just havin' a bout of the jitters.<br/>Happens.)")
('Wuhan', 'T-Take care out there.')
('Wuhan', 'O-Oh! You want t-takeout?')
('Haimin', "Phew. I'm relieved to see my husband's<br/>finally motivated. Guess my scolding did the trick.")
('Haimin', "By the way, I heard that Heiyue is on the move.<br/>Let's hope they get to the bottom of this.")
('Haimin', "In the meantime, my husband and I are going to do<br/>our best to live up to Heiyue's expectations and<br/>ensure this business continues.")
('Haimin', "My husband may seem a bit aloof at times, but he's<br/>the type who always gets the job done.")
('Haimin', "That's part of why Guihua Fandian is<br/>still flourishing.")
('Haimin', "...I'm still in shock over the horrible incident from<br/>last night.")
('Haimin', "Stay safe, you all. It's a dangerous world out there.")
('Haimin', 'Have you had dinner yet? There are plenty of good<br/>places to eat around here.')
('Haimin', "If you want my personal recommendation...well, I'd<br/>suggest staying here and having our food! Not biased<br/>at all.")
('Haimin', 'Our Guihua Fandian dish—which is named after<br/>our fine establishment—has been beloved by people<br/>here for half a century.')
('Haimin', 'I apologize on behalf of my husband. His behavior<br/>right now is unacceptable.')
('Haimin', 'I really wish he would get his act together. He should<br/>be used to this by now...')
('Haimin', "Oh, look at me prattling on. I shouldn't be bothering<br/>you with my problems.")
('Haimin', 'Feel free to order anything you want. Maybe my<br/>husband will snap out of his funk if he can focus on<br/>his work.')
('Filenkov', "Well, it's been fun, but I must be off now. I think<br/>I'll hop on tonight's ship and head for the<br/>Central East.")
('Filenkov', "Elsaim sounds like a lovely place to start. Perhaps<br/>after that, I'll challenge myself with a trek to<br/>northern Valis.")
('Filenkov', "Both spots are a tad unstable, so they're not<br/>popular tourist destinations. Meaning, they're<br/>likely chock-full of discoveries to be made.")
('Filenkov', 'It was a surprise to see people being cleared out<br/>so early in the morning.')
('Filenkov', 'Maybe I should hole up in my room today and plan<br/>my next trip.')
('Filenkov', "After all, I'd rather not do anything that would<br/>make me come off as suspicious.")
('Filenkov', "Over my travels, I've learned to keep to myself when<br/>trouble starts a-brewing.")
('Filenkov', 'Unlike me, Jigen has firmly planted his feet into the<br/>ground and spread his roots.')
('Filenkov', "That approach has its perks, I'll admit. Having a<br/>consistent clientele must be nice.")
('Filenkov', "I can't blame him for wanting stability, but me?<br/>I like my freedom too much to change course.")
('Filenkov', 'Hello, there. Do you have an interest in rare goods<br/>and esoteric knick-knacks from all over the world?')
('Filenkov', "Well, you're in luck, because I run a used<br/>goods business. I have all sorts of obscure gems.")
('Filenkov', "From strange machinery to priceless antiques.<br/>You name it, I've got it.")
('Filenkov', "I'm still mid-journey, but I'll let you take a look at<br/>what I have on me.")
('Filenkov', 'When it comes to the Republic, the Eastern Quarter<br/>is the place to be. It really feels like home for me.')
('Filenkov', "I've been to all kinds of places: small nations in the<br/>Central East, North Ambrian slums, and more old<br/>cities in the East than I could name.")
('Filenkov', "But there's still so much more to see.")
('Filenkov', "One of these days, I'd like to make my way into<br/>uncharted territory. That's my dream.")
('Vicar Hou-Seng', 'The preparations for the funeral are complete. It will<br/>be held tomorrow.')
('Vicar Hou-Seng', 'I hope that this ceremony will give the people some<br/>much-needed comfort.')
('Aaron', 'Yeah... Give my bros a good send off. I want them to<br/>go on their journey in peace.')
('Aaron', 'I plan on settling the score before then.')
('Vicar Hou-Seng', 'Very well. Just leave things here to me.')
('Vicar Hou-Seng', "It's our job to put the people at ease and provide<br/>guidance for lost souls.")
('Vicar Hou-Seng', "...By the way, am I the only one who felt like the<br/>older civilians were familiar with last night's<br/>strange phenomena?")
('Vicar Hou-Seng', 'Now that I think on it, I believe my predecessor<br/>mentioned something about a taboo...')
('Vicar Hou-Seng', "I've finished the funeral arrangements and greeted the<br/>families of the deceased. Tomorrow, we will be<br/>sending them on their final journey...")
('Vicar Hou-Seng', 'It will be an open casket funeral, and there will be<br/>time for you to come up and say your goodbyes.')
('Vicar Hou-Seng', 'Please come back safely, Aaron. Your friends would<br/>want you to be here to see them off.')
('Vicar Hou-Seng', 'What happened to Sei, Huang, and the other victims<br/>fills me with great sorrow. I truly hope their souls<br/>can rest in peace.')
('Vicar Hou-Seng', 'We will perform our duty and send them to the<br/>heavens above. That is the best way we can honor<br/>their courage and their memories.')
('Vicar Hou-Seng', "In accordance with the wishes of the surviving<br/>families, we've arranged to collect their bodies<br/>once Heiyue has finished performing the autopsies.")
('Vicar Hou-Seng', "I will make arrangements for the funeral while caring<br/>for the citizens' mental states.")
('Vicar Hou-Seng', "Tourists often ask me about the temple's place in the<br/>Eastern Quarter's history.")
('Vicar Hou-Seng', 'Long before the Calvardian Revolution, this place was<br/>a humble trading town.')
('Vicar Hou-Seng', 'But about a century ago, many immigrants flocked<br/>here due to the chaos in the East, and those<br/>people founded this temple.')
('Vicar Hou-Seng', 'I heard you got into yet another fight, Aaron.')
('Vicar Hou-Seng', "I understand that you're driven to protect the people<br/>here, but if you resort to violence every time, then<br/>you're stooping to their level.")
('Vicar Hou-Seng', "I'm worried that you will one day be consumed by<br/>anger and hatred—and lose control of yourself in<br/>the process.")
('Aaron', "I'll keep that in mind. Your word is gospel, after all.")
('Aaron', "Don't worry, though. I won't get the temple wrapped<br/>up in any of this.")
('Aaron', "If it'll make you feel better, I can start going easy on<br/>those weaklings from now on.")
('Vicar Hou-Seng', 'Back in the day, I used to teach Aaron and his friends<br/>at Sunday School.')
('Vicar Hou-Seng', "He was just as unpredictable then as he is now.<br/>Honestly, it worries me that that hasn't changed.")
('Vicar Hou-Seng', "Welcome to the Langport temple. I'm guessing you<br/>all are tourists, yes?")
('Vicar Hou-Seng', "Our customs may differ from the churches you're<br/>accustomed to, but we make sure to teach them to<br/>any and all who visit.")
('Agnès', 'You must be used to dealing with tourists.')
('Vicar Hou-Seng', 'Indeed. While this temple primarily exists to support<br/>Easterners, we still get many visitors from the western<br/>side of the continent.')
('Vicar Hou-Seng', 'Personally, I see it as an excellent opportunity to help<br/>others understand the values of the East.')
('Vicar Hou-Seng', 'Nothing makes me happier than seeing people<br/>become interested in Eastern history and culture.')
('Vicar Hou-Seng', 'In the East, the Goddess of the Sky is referred to as<br/>the Heavenly Mother.')
('Vicar Hou-Seng', 'Many of the teachings and events recorded in<br/>scripture have taken on different forms in<br/>other places...')
('Vicar Hou-Seng', '...but I believe the Goddess of the Sky and the<br/>Heavenly Mother are one and the same.')
('Priest Sei-Lan', 'The older people in town have confused expressions<br/>on their faces.')
('Priest Sei-Lan', "They are troubled over something from the past,<br/>apparently, but they haven't let me in on their secret.")
('Priest Sei-Lan', "Regardless, I'll do my best to calm their nerves.")
('Priest Sei-Lan', "I... I just can't believe it... My former students<br/>are...dead?")
('Priest Sei-Lan', "And Aaron's run off to get revenge...")
('Priest Sei-Lan', "I'm barely keeping it together. This is just too cruel...")
('Priest Sei-Lan', 'Oh, Heavenly Mother, please watch over Aaron, as<br/>well as my remaining students...')
('Priest Sei-Lan', 'I heard Aaron got into yet another fight.')
('Priest Sei-Lan', 'He was one of my former students. Quite the<br/>troublemaker, that one.')
('Priest Sei-Lan', 'I know he cares deeply for his friends—as well as this<br/>town—but he still worries me.')
('Priest Sei-Lan', 'May the blessings of the Heavenly Mother be with<br/>him and his friends.')
('Priest Sei-Lan', "Oh? It's not often I see you with outsiders, Aaron.")
('Priest Sei-Lan', "Normally, you're with Huang and Syd around this<br/>time of night.")
('Aaron', 'Hey, even I gotta switch things up every now<br/>and then.')
('Aaron', "I'll probably join up with them later. Once I'm bored<br/>with this guy, I'll ditch his ass.")
('Van', "Swearin' in a church, huh? Damn. You got no class.")
('Priest Sei-Lan', 'But you just... *sigh* Never mind.')
('Priest Sei-Lan', 'Anyway, I trust you, Aaron, but please ease up on<br/>the violence. Remember that you and your friends are<br/>sacred children of our Heavenly Mother.')
('Priest Sei-Lan', 'I only taught Aaron for one year at Sunday School,<br/>but he certainly made an impression.')
('Priest Sei-Lan', "He was a mischievous child...and now he's a<br/>mischievous teenager. It worries me that he<br/>hasn't changed.")
('Priest Sei-Lan', "But I'm glad his desire to protect his friends and the<br/>town still burns bright. I always feel safe when<br/>he's around.")
('Priest Sei-Lan', 'Welcome. This is where we revere our<br/>Heavenly Mother. Are you here to pray?')
('Priest Sei-Lan', 'Oh? Is something the matter?')
('Feri', "Umm... I kinda feel out of my element. I thought this<br/>place would be like the churches back home, but it's<br/>totally different.")
('Priest Sei-Lan', "Heehee. I understand. Well, don't be shy.")
('Priest Sei-Lan', 'We may call her the Heavenly Mother, but She is<br/>undoubtedly the same Goddess you worship.')
('Priest Sei-Lan', 'Regardless of race or borders, we all share the same<br/>belief in the Goddess.')
('Van', "The air about this place is definitely different from a<br/>Central Eastern temple, but it's the same at its core.")

('Mouton', 'Please save meeeeee!')
('Mouton', "After a full day of non-stop prayer, I finally decided<br/>to go back to the inn and rest...buuut I'm too stressed<br/>to sleep.")

('Assistant Shenli', "As Doctor Longkai explained, it's made from a<br/>combination of dragon bone, Soul Moss, and<br/>Divine Powder.")
('Assistant Shenli', "When it's applied, it hits all of the vital points of the<br/>body—and injects an abundance of energy into them.<br/>The backlash is immense.")
('Assistant Shenli', 'Are you SURE you want to use this?')
('Aaron', 'Damn right I am. Compared to the pain my bros<br/>went through, this is nothing.')
('Aaron', "I'm gonna put those bastards through hell. If two<br/>weeks of rehab is what it takes to do that, then that's<br/>a price I'm just gonna have to pay!")

('Assistant Shenli', "What's going to happen to Langport now?")
('Assistant Shenli', "Well, no matter what happens, I plan to stay by<br/>Doctor Longkai's side and walk the path of medicine<br/>with him.")
('Assistant Shenli', "What're you doing here, Aaron? I thought you didn't<br/>get hurt in that fight.")
('Assistant Shenli', "Or did you go and get yourself poisoned by all that<br/>white powder you use when you're crossdressing?")
('Aaron', "Nah. I'm just tagging along with this guy. Don't even<br/>know why he came here.")
('Aaron', "And for the record, I can't get mercury poisoning<br/>from that stuff—because there's no mercury in it in<br/>the first place.")
('Assistant Shenli', 'I know, I know. Just pulling your leg.')
('Assistant Shenli', 'Anyway, I know you like to rough those outsiders up,<br/>but try not to get yourself injured in the process,<br/>all right?')
('Aaron', 'Okay, Mom.')
('Aaron', 'You can pump the brakes on the nagging any<br/>day now.')
('Assistant Shenli', 'For some reason, the air smells...different tonight.')
('Assistant Shenli', "Normally, I wouldn't think anything of it. Since we're<br/>seaside, changes in the wind are to be expected.")
('Assistant Shenli', "But...I don't know. My gut's telling me<br/>something's off.")
('Assistant Shenli', "Well, there's a face I haven't seen in a while. How are<br/>you doing, Van? It's been a while.")
('Assistant Shenli', 'What brings you to Langport? Wait, let me guess.<br/>You got a job from Heiyue?')
('Van', 'Your guesses are on point as ever.')
('Van', "Still working as Doc's assistant? I thought you<br/>would've been long gone by now.")
('Assistant Shenli', "I've got a couple reasons for sticking around. For one,<br/>I still have so much I can learn from him.")
('Assistant Shenli', "As for the other... Well, I'm pretty sure you can figure<br/>that one out on your own.")
('Van', 'Yeah, I can piece it together in my head.')
('Van', "Always good to pay off your debts—and you're<br/>returning the favor for your whole family by yourself.<br/>Mad respect.")
('Assistant Shenli', 'Heh. Thanks, man.')
('Assistant Shenli', "Anyway, if you need medicine or a basic examination,<br/>I'll be happy to help in the doctor's stead.")
('Assistant Shenli', "Things have been really busy around here lately.<br/>That's why he placed me in charge of prescriptions.")

('Poisson', "Anyway, if you need a drink, I'd be happy to fill<br/>your cup.")
('Poisson', "This pub is nothing like the other gambling joints<br/>under Heiyue's watch.")

('Van', "It sure ain't gonna be a cakewalk—especially with<br/>Heiyue in the picture.")
('Van', 'Wish I had your nerves of steel right about now.')
('Poisson', "Haha. I promise it's not an innate ability. Mine were<br/>forged over years of witnessing Jack and his plights.")
('Poisson', "Though I don't intend to pry into yours. After all, this<br/>place is a neutral zone.")
('Van', 'Glad some things in the universe are constant.')
('Van', "I'll be sure to leave my troubles at the door when I<br/>drop by. Might pop in every now and then to trade<br/>info with Jack.")
('Poisson', "Of course. You're more than welcome to do<br/>business here.")

('Caroline', "I'll definitely be back!")
('Poisson', "I've known Jack for many years, and I owe him a<br/>fair deal.")
('Poisson', "It's only due to his efforts that this place remains<br/>neutral ground.")
('Poisson', "Though lately, there's been some trouble brewing.")
('Jack', "Normally, I'd say hedging your bets and folding<br/>would be the best play here.")
('Jack', "Though now that Aaron's being honest with himself,<br/>I think it's time we go all in.")
('Jack', "Sometimes, you can't take a step forward unless<br/>you're willing to shoot for the moon.")
('Jack', "That's why I'm with you guys till the end.")
('Jack', "You're not the only ones who are worried<br/>about Aaron.")
('Jack', "I'll touch base with my sources and see if I can get any<br/>inside info.")
('Jack', "Might also get some leads on Heiyue and A—which<br/>is a whole other minefield. If those two go to war, this<br/>safe haven won't be safe anymore.")
('Jack', "I should've known better than to keep secrets<br/>from you.")
('Jack', "Well, we're all in this together now, so we might as<br/>well help each other out.")
('Jack', "You take care of Aaron, and I'll gather information.<br/>Fair deal?")
('Jack', "I'm betting Aaron's got a bone to pick with<br/>those assholes.")
('Jack', 'Might be a handy partner for this case.')
('Jack', "I have some serious beef with A, but that's neither<br/>here nor there.")
('Jack', "Anyway, I've got plenty of info to sell, so if you're<br/>interested in buyin', you know where to find me.")
('Jack', "Can't blame ya for makin' a career change.")
('Jack', "The tourism industry ain't as cutthroat as the<br/>fixer trade.")
('Jack', 'Best to leave that old life behind and pursue a<br/>respectable job—or you may end up a sad,<br/>lonely drunkard.')
('Van', "You do realize that's a self-own, right?")
('Jack', "When you've been in Langport for as long as I have,<br/>you tend to hear a lot about Aaron Wei.")
('Jack', "That kid has made a hell of a name for himself, and<br/>he's been the talk of the town for the last few years.")
('Jack', "I've also been hearin' a lot about A lately. That whole<br/>situation sounds like a mess.")
('Jack', 'You guys watch yourselves out there, all right?')
('Halle', 'I overheard your conversation. So you know that I<br/>lost, then?')
('Van', 'Well, yeah.')
('Halle', "*sigh* This is so humiliating. I'm Jack's partner, so I<br/>can't lose face like this.")
('Halle', "I swear I'll get them next time. I won't go down<br/>without a fight!")
('Van', "Yeah, I know you'll kick their asses into next week.<br/>You've got this.")
('Halle', 'Heehee. Thanks.')
('Halle', 'Though I know I may not get the chance.')
('Halle', "Earlier, Jack said, 'I'm gonna take off soon so I can<br/>drink the night away,' but I'm guessing he's going out<br/>to confront them with you, right?")
('Van', "Since A's involved, you gotta understand where he's<br/>coming from.")
('Halle', "Sure, but he doesn't have to be such a worrywart.<br/>He should know I can take care of myself.")
('Halle', "But fine. I won't be selfish.")
('Halle', 'Sorry for getting you wrapped up in my mess.')
('Van', "Hey, don't apologize. You didn't do nothin'.")
('Halle', "Aaron's finally made his decision, so I wanted to<br/>be useful. I wish I could've done more, though...")
('Halle', 'But it sounds like you guys are on the cusp of<br/>cracking the case.')
('Halle', 'This is just my intuition speaking, but I think we<br/>might be better off looking at this from a<br/>different perspective.')
('Halle', "And Aaron's might be the ace in the hole we're<br/>looking for.")
('Halle', "I understand how he feels. I'm fuming, too.")
('Halle', "Jack's handling it a little better, but yeah, it's a tough<br/>day for everyone.")
('Halle', "Don't worry about us, though. For now, you need to<br/>focus on finding Aaron and tracking those<br/>murderers down.")
('Halle', "I'm sorry we don't have much information to offer.<br/>We'll try to gather some while you're doing<br/>your thing.")
('Halle', 'Do what you can to help Aaron.')
('Halle', "In the meantime, Jack and I will keep looking into A.<br/>Hopefully we'll have a breakthrough soon.")
('Halle', 'If you two figure anything out about A, let us know.')
('Halle', 'Jack and I will do anything we can to help.')
('Halle', "It's nice that Jack's worried about me, but he should<br/>know I can take care of myself.")
('Halle', "But fine. I won't be selfish.")
('Halle', "Let me know if there's anything I can do.")
('Halle', 'Oh, are your assistants not with you?')
('Halle', "I'm sure you don't need me to tell you this, but<br/>Langport can be very dangerous at night.")
('Halle', 'You better watch yourself out there, all right?')
('Van', 'I know, I know. Jack said the same thing.')
('Halle', "Oh, did he? That's funny.")
('Halle', "Well, I know you're busy with work, but if you get<br/>some free time, drop by for a drink.")
('Halle', "If you do, I'll make you some special sweets to go<br/>with it.")
('Halle', "I know you're busy with work, but if you get some<br/>free time, drop by for a drink.")
('Halle', "If you do, I'll make you some special sweets to go<br/>with it.")
('Halle', "I can't remember the last time I got to teach someone<br/>how to gamble. We don't often see fresh faces<br/>in here.")
('Halle', "I don't recommend coming here at night, but feel free<br/>to hang out during the day!")
('Halle', "A lot's happened over the years, but I've finally found<br/>the place where I belong.")
('Halle', 'Let me know if you want to order a drink or if you<br/>need me to deal your cards.')
('Halle', "Oh, and if you need someone to lay into Jack, I'm<br/>your gal.")
('Halle', "Oh, hi there, Aaron! You're with Van?")
('Jack', "I didn't expect you two to become such fast friends.")
('Aaron', "You've got the wrong idea. I'm just tagging along so I<br/>can see what his fixer business is all about.")
('Aaron', "And now I've learned who two of his sources are.")
('Halle', "Cat's out of the bag.")
('Jack', "Well, I guess it can't hurt to shadow him.")
('Jack', "But if you're planning to surpass him, forget it.<br/>Van's the best in his trade.")
('Aaron', "Don't worry. Becoming a fixer is at the bottom of my<br/>list of career choices. Though if I did, I'd run circles<br/>around the old fart.")
('Van', "First off, no, you wouldn't. Secondly, I'm not an<br/>old man. Cut that shit out.")
('Halle', '(Heehee. These two make for a fun pair.)')
('Jack', "(For sure. They're a comedy duo in the making.)")
('Shitao', "What? There's been an incident at the harbor?<br/>Well, guess I better get off my ass and check it out.")
('Shitao', "Ugh... Why'd the world have to go to shit on the two<br/>days I took off? I've got some rotten luck.")
('Shitao', "I ain't never forgiving those A bastards...")
('Shitao', '*hic*')
('Shitao', "Agh! How can I be drinkin' aftah lasht night...")
('Shitao', "I was gonna challenge Aaron's friendsh to<br/>some gamblin'... *sob*")
('Shitao', 'Damn it! I lost AGAIN! AAAAAAGH!')
('Shitao', 'How the HELL did Jack get so good?')
('Shitao', 'The guy was as red as a tomato. He practically drank<br/>himself under the table—and he still kicked my ass!')
('Shitao', "He's got the devil's own luck, I tell ya!")
('Shitao', "I can tell you've got the chops to be a gambling pro.")
('Shitao', "Here's some advice from an expert: go big or<br/>go home. That's the best way to enjoy a good gamble!")
('Shitao', "Of course, you're always livin' on the knife edge of<br/>bankruptcy, but that's the life we lead! Wahahaha!")
('Shitao', 'Hahaha. We sailors gotta make the most of our time<br/>on land.')
('Shitao', 'When we hop aboard our ships, we leave behind the<br/>booze, the women, and the gambling lifestyle.')
('Shitao', "So I'm gonna cut loose and gamble till I drop!<br/>Ya better watch yourself, Jack! I'll have my<br/>revenge yet!")
('Gomez', 'As I understand it, Heiyue leaves this bar alone.')
('Gomez', "That means it's not under their protection.")
('Gomez', 'Thankfully, Poisson and Jack are strong enough on<br/>their own.')
('Gomez', 'Even if Heiyue and A go to war, I think this place<br/>will survive.')
('Gomez', '*sigh* I hate this kinda stuff. I hope those mafia<br/>goons rot in hell.')
('Gomez', 'I wish there was more I could do to help. Maybe I<br/>could lend Poisson a hand.')
('Gomez', "As far as dealing with those rat bastards...I'll just have<br/>to pin my hopes on Jack and that red-haired kid.")
('Gomez', "Can't rely on Heiyue, it seems. This would be a lot<br/>easier if they'd step in...")
('Gomez', "Well, I tried my luck in a game with Jack. I'm sure<br/>you can guess how that went.")
('Gomez', "I thought he hadn't changed at all, but I see now I<br/>was dead wrong.")
('Gomez', "Even when plastered, he's as sharp as a tack.")
('Gomez', "Honestly, I think he's amazing.")
('Gomez', 'Not often we see tourists in this place.')
('Gomez', "Normally, I'm not fond of people wandering in here<br/>out of idle curiosity.")
('Gomez', "However, if you understand what makes this place so<br/>special, then you're already one of us, as far as<br/>I'm concerned.")
('Gomez', "This pub is the same as ever. Jack hasn't<br/>changed, either.")
('Gomez', "Not that I care, mind you. I'm always happy to eat<br/>and drink here, especially when Halle is the<br/>one serving.")
('Gomez', "Though I probably shouldn't be coming here at this<br/>time of day. This place is always swarming with<br/>drunkards early in the morning.")
('Gomez', "I'd like to gamble more, but I have to be careful.<br/>A truck driver's salary has too few zeroes, I'm afraid.")
('Gomez', "I think I'll just sit back and play spectator.")
('Bracer Xiaoling', "Man, this is awful. I can't believe locals were<br/>murdered in cold blood...")

('Bracer Hornet', 'At the onsite inspection, Detective Dart and I saw<br/>the traces of the murder weapons.')
('Bracer Hornet', 'We managed to get Heiyue to open up about the<br/>autopsies of the victims, and we hit the bullseye.')
('Bracer Hornet', "Turns out, the weapons used by Almata's ringleaders<br/>are even more dangerous than we imagined.")
('Bracer Hornet', "They were acquired via a special route.<br/>Detective Dart's hunch was right on the money.")
('Bracer Hornet', 'I thought Heiyue would be coy when answering our<br/>questions, but they were surprisingly forthright.')
('Bracer Hornet', "Although, it wouldn't be out of character for them to<br/>have merely been testing us.")
('Bracer Hornet', "Regardless, we'll take all the info we can get.<br/>We must ensure the safety of the citizenry by any<br/>means necessary.")
('Caroline', 'I had a wonderful time. You have my gratitude!')

('Cao', "(...Ah, so that's their move.)")
('Cao', '(Now, then, who shall I have handle this in<br/>my absence?)')
('Aaron', 'Hahaha! Even the dudes were falling for me by the<br/>end there.')
('Aaron', "Not that I'm surprised—this is ME we're<br/>talking about.")
(40301, 'Wonderful work as always, Aaron, but must you rile<br/>up the crowd like that?')
('Aaron', 'My fans deserve special treatment. If that bugs you so<br/>much, fire me.')
(40301, "*sigh* You know we can't afford to do that...")

('Van', "So that's how it is, huh?")
('Ashen', 'You noticed?')
('Van', "Yeah. He's got all mannerisms down pat, but the way<br/>he uses his muscles is just a bit different.")

('Ashen', 'Bàbà likes Aaron, too—enough for the subject of<br/>marriage to come up.')
('Feri', 'Oh, my!')
('Agnès', 'Are you engaged?!')
('Ashen', "My younger brother's the one stuck carrying the<br/>family name—I'm free to live my own life.")
('Ashen', 'Besides, I prefer men like Cao, anyway.')
('Feri', 'Wait... Really?!')
('Van', '(Girl needs to get her eyes checked.)')
('Agnès', "(Shh... You're being rude!)")
('Ashen', "I just can't see Aaron that way. He's more like a<br/>brother, if anything.")
('Ashen', "But honestly, Van's not half bad looking, either.")
('Van', "Heh. 'Preciate it.")
('Agnès', '(What was that about her eyes?)')
('Van', '(Erk...)')
('Feri', "(I'm confused. Does she need glasses or not?)")
('Ashen', 'On to the next order of business. Would you like me<br/>to show you around town?')
('Van', 'Nah, we can handle the snooping ourselves.')
('Ashen', "Really? Then, I suppose I'll be taking my leave.")
('Ashen', "Call me if you need anything. I'm counting on your<br/>help with Aaron!")
('Van', "Will do. We'll deal with your pain-in-the-ass friend<br/>one way or another.")
('Van', "That was more of a detour than I was expectin'.")
('Van', "Let's check in at the hotel and grab some grub.")
('System', 'A short drive later, Van, Agnès, and Feri arrived at<br/>their hotel.')

('Van', 'Sure is.')
('Houseman', "She's a beaut, son, but she's in trouble if you don't<br/>treat her right.")
('Houseman', 'See, the ocean air blows through this city.')
('Feri', 'How would the wind hurt a car?')
('Agnès', 'Oh. You mean the salt in the air will corrode<br/>the paint.')
('Houseman', 'What do you say I wax her down to protect her from<br/>the elements, hm?')

('Feri', 'There are so many people here!')
('Agnès', 'It was like this when I visited as well.')
('Agnès', "I'm surprised, though, Van. You knew exactly where<br/>to find the hotel.")
('Van', 'What can I say?')
('Van', "I spent a couple of months here back when I was<br/>starting out, and I've been back a few times for work.")
('Van', 'But all my info is out of date. What we need now is<br/>fresh leads.')
('Agnès', "Right. Information concerning Almata's<br/>dummy company.")
('Feri', 'And anything we can find out about Aaron.')
('Van', "Don't forget the Geneses. The one Agnès has must've<br/>been reacting to somethin'.")
('Van', 'For all we know, everything could be<br/>connected, anyway.')
('Van', "Oughta be clear once we get to work, so let's mosey.")
('Feri', 'Roger that!')

('Van', "Hey, man. How's it hangin'?")
('Antique Seller Jigen', "Van! What's it been, four years?")

('Antique Seller Jigen', "Not that the wife really sees a difference in when I'm<br/>doin' it. Hahaha.")
('Van', 'Well, least you got that going for you.')
('Antique Seller Jigen', "My old girl's all well and good, but what about you?<br/>Struttin' around town with a doll on each arm.")
('Van', "Asshat. You know that ain't how it is.")
('Agnès', 'Uh, hello...')
('Feri', 'Good afternoon.')
('Van', "Anyways, we're here to ask you about something.")

('Agnès', "(It won't always be safe to show people the<br/>real thing.)")
('Antique Seller Jigen', "Hmm... Can't say I have.")
('Antique Seller Jigen', "It's clearly quite old and of superb<br/>craftsmanship, though. Is it a pocket watch?")
('Van', "Nah, it's an orbment.")
('Van', 'No rumors about any like this floating around?<br/>Anything helps.')
('Antique Seller Jigen', 'Hmm...')
('Antique Seller Jigen', 'It was way back, but there was some rumor about a<br/>fancy orbal watch being sold off.')
('Antique Seller Jigen', "Then, there's a long stretch of no news at all...")
('Antique Seller Jigen', '...until just recently. I heard of something matching<br/>that description being sold down by the docks.')
('Van', 'Any idea who sold it in the first place?')
('Antique Seller Jigen', "Couldn't tell ya.")
('Antique Seller Jigen', "But maybe the fact that even I don't know oughta tell<br/>you something.")
('Van', 'No kidding.')
('Van', 'If an expert like you is totally in the dark, something<br/>must be going on here...')

(40301, 'Well, well. Look what the cat dragged in.')
(40302, 'You should know better than to come to a place<br/>like this.')
('Agnès', 'Umm...')
(40303, "Heeeya, girlies... *hic* How 'bout weez buys youse<br/>twos a drink?")

(40304, 'Aaagh! Aidios above, yer gonna break it!')

('Halle', 'Seriously? Again with this?')
('Halle', 'How many times do I have to tell you two not to<br/>bother folks?')
(40303, "Aww, c'mon, Halle! We were just tryin' to spook 'em.")
(40304, "The li'l one nearly took ma' arm clean off!")

(40305, "She's right, y'know!")
(40301, 'What kind of a loser almost gets their arm broken by<br/>a kid?')
(40302, 'That guy!')
(40301, 'Bwahaha!')
('Van', 'Times may change, but the drunks here stay<br/>the same.')
('Halle', "I'm so sorry about them. The sailors all come to get<br/>rowdy during their breaks.")
('Halle', "They're a bunch only a mother could love, but try to<br/>forgive them, okay?")
('Agnès', 'O-Of course...')
('Feri', "It reminds me of the grown-ups back home who<br/>couldn't handle their drinks.")
('Van', 'Heh. Nice seeing you, Halle.')
('Halle', "Good to see you, too. I hear you've landed a real<br/>toughie of a job this time.")
('Agnès', 'Oh, you two know each other?')
('Van', 'Yup.')
('Halle', 'Let me show you to your table.')
('Halle', "My name's Halle. When I'm not serving drinks, I'm<br/>dealing cards around these parts.")
('Agnès', "It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Agnès Claudel.")
('Agnès', "I work for Van's company part time to...<br/>Well, actually, it's kind of complicated.")
('Feri', 'And my name is Ferida Al-Fayed.')
('Feri', "I'm here to train and pay back Van for his help.")
('Halle', "The pleasure's all mine.<br/>When did you become such a mama duck?")
('Van', "Life's been real weird to me lately, okay?")
('Van', 'So, your partner hanging around here somewhere?<br/>Or did he finally kick the bucket?')
('Halle', "Nope. Just hanging out on Gehenna's doorstep<br/>like usual.")
('Jack', "You better not be talking about me. This<br/>hangover's nothin'.")
('Jack', 'It really been two years already?')
('Van', 'Since last meeting in person, yeah.')
('Jack', "Times really are changing, huh? The lone wolf's got<br/>himself some pups.")
('Van', 'Shut it.')
('Jack', "Name's Jack. Jack Trevor.")
('Jack', "Ain't a gambler out there who doesn't know<br/>my name.")
('Agnès', "I-It's nice to meet you, sir.")
('Feri', 'Wow. You must be quite skilled.')
('Van', "I know it's hard to believe, but he's tellin' the truth.")
('Van', 'These two have a real reputation as a gambling duo.')
('Feri', "Ooh! That's exciting.")
('Jack', "Call it a duo, but it's more like I'm on a leash here...")
('Halle', 'Got a problem with that?')
('Agnès', 'Haha...')
('Van', 'They travel around to casinos all over the place.')
('Van', "Which lets 'em trade all the info they pick up along<br/>the way.")
('Jack', 'Being an informant is just a side gig.')
('Halle', "Then, what's your real job? 'Alcohol Enthusiast'?")
('Jack', "Gambling's a real job...")
('Halle', 'Suuure. Anyway, what did you want to ask<br/>about, Van?')
('Van', "Two years back, I started hearin' about some guy, but<br/>apparently he's a real local celebrity these days.")
('Van', "The name 'Aaron Wei' ring any bells?")
('Jack', "Ever the lucky sleuth, aren'tcha?")
('Jack', 'As it happens, this bar is one of his usual haunts.')
('Feri', 'Really?!')
('Agnès', 'Can you tell us about him? According to Ashen, he<br/>sounds like quite the character.')
('Halle', "He's always one bad fight away from ending up<br/>injured, but that never-say-die attitude is part of<br/>his charm.")
('Halle', "You'll be hard-pressed to find anyone talking poorly<br/>about him around here.")
('Jack', "He's a hot-blooded guy, for sure.")
('Jack', "It'd be easy to brand him as a no-good gang leader...")
('Jack', '...but, honestly, those kids would be way worse off<br/>without him.')
('Jack', "Even old folks give him kudos for keepin' things<br/>in line.")
('Van', "Ain't that somethin'.")
('Jack', "Pretty good gambler, too. Sometimes he'll challenge<br/>me and Halle to a game.")
('Jack', 'Believe it or not, he wins a third of the time.')
('Van', "You're kidding!")
('Jack', "Don't talk like you haven't given me a run for my<br/>mira, too.")
('Agnès', 'The more I hear about Aaron, the more he reminds<br/>me of Van.')
('Jack', "Difference is Aaron's actually got looks. Heheh.")
('Halle', "Now that I think about it, Van's what you'd get if you<br/>combined Jack and Aaron.")
('Jack', "The hell's that supposed to mean?")
('Van', "...Let's talk about what's really wrong here.")
('Halle', "Jack's face?")
('Van', 'Fair, but I mean something important.')
('Jack', "C'mon!")
('Van', 'Bet you guys know the Messeldam Trading<br/>Company, right?')
('Van', "Tell me, what're the odds Aaron gives up on running<br/>them outta town?")
('Halle', 'Zero.')
('Jack', "Way I see it, you've got two options.")
('Jack', 'One: Take care of business before the kid goes and<br/>does something crazy.')
('Jack', 'Two: Make him compromise with you.')
('Agnès', 'Both sound rather difficult...')
('Van', "And how's A doing?")
('Jack', "They're more unhinged than Aaron, that's for sure.")
('Jack', "Word is the thugs they're hiring are the worst of<br/>the worst.")
('Halle', "They haven't shown their faces in the Eastern<br/>Quarter since Aaron whooped their butts.")
('Halle', "It's hard to rest easy, though. With them still hanging<br/>around the other districts, they're clearly<br/>planning SOMETHING.")
('Halle', "I know the guild's got their eyes peeled, but I'm not<br/>sure there's much they can do.")
('Jack', "Speakin' of which, I hear you've been getting<br/>buddy-buddy with the bracers lately.")
('Jack', "What's up with that? You gonna visit the branch<br/>in town?")
('Van', "Bermotti must've told you, huh? I'm just pickin' up<br/>some slack for them, that's all.")
('Jack', 'Whatever you say.')
('Jack', "With all this going on, I've gotta wonder what<br/>Heiyue is thinking.")
('Jack', "We're more or less safe since this bar's a neutral zone,<br/>but otherwise, Heiyue runs the show around here.")
('Jack', 'And let me tell you, some of their elders are real<br/>monsters—not to mention Cao Lee.')
('Halle', "Yeah, we can't get too comfortable around that guy.")
('Halle', "I'd say it's good that he's in Crossbell right now, but<br/>he's probably there to call up Yin.")
('Van', 'Figures...')
('Agnès', 'Yin?')
('Feri', "I feel like I've heard that name before...")
('Halle', 'The legendary xiongshou—an assassin of sorts.<br/>Some call Yin the demon of the Eastern Quarter.')
('Halle', 'Supposedly they moved over to Crossbell a few<br/>years back.')
('Halle', "They haven't been nearly as active, but Yin's name<br/>always pops up when something big is going down.")
('Agnès', 'Huh...')
('Feri', 'I wonder if my people have fought with them before.')
('Van', "Were I a betting man, I'd say the demon ain't the<br/>only ace up their sleeve, either.")
('Van', "Assumin' the rumors I've heard are true, course.")
('Jack', "Ugh. Don't make me think about all that creepy shit.")
('Jack', "All I know is this: this town's on a collision course<br/>with bloodshed.")
('Halle', "*sigh* Unless something's done, at least.")
('Van', 'Lemme know if you hear anything, all right?')
('Jack', "Will do. You're stayin' at Guihua Fandian, yeah?")
('Jack', "Shame we couldn't squeeze in a game or two.")
('Van', "Gotta save that for off-hours. Don't wanna corrupt<br/>the kiddos, y'know.")
('Halle', "Please visit again sometime. I'll make sure you get a<br/>warm welcome next time.")
('Agnès', 'Thank you! We will.')
('Feri', 'I wanna hear lots of old stories about Van.')
('Halle', "Oh, I've got some real juicy ones.")
('Van', 'Better keep those to yourself, ya hear?')
('System', 'It was still early, but feeling tired from their first day<br/>of work, the group chose to return to the hotel.')
('Van', '...Yeah. Not a problem.')
('Van', 'Be there in a sec.')
('Jack', 'A flush. Looks like I win this one.')
('Van', "Bah. Was feelin' lucky tonight, too.")
('Jack', "You mighta had a shot if you hadn't gone all in at the<br/>end there.")
('Jack', "A win's a win, though. You're paying double for your<br/>info this time.")
('Van', 'Yeah, whatever. Your booze fund was looking pretty<br/>dry anyway.')
('Jack', "By the way, I heard Elaine's in town.")
('Van', 'Oh, right—forgot you knew her. Yeah, just got here<br/>this evening.')
('Jack', 'Heh heh.')
('Van', "What's with the creepy laugh?")
('Jack', "Ain't it tough bein' so popular? Everywhere ya turn<br/>there's another girl vying for your attention.")
('Van', 'You have too much to drink, bud?')
('Van', "Like you've got any right to talk when we all know<br/>your 'old pal' is—")
('Jack', "Nope! We're done talkin' about this!")
('Halle', 'Talking about what?')
('Jack', "It's guy stuff. Way too dirty for the likes of you.<br/>Now, shoo.")
('Halle', 'Ugh. Why are men like this?')
('Halle', 'Asshole!')
('Jack', "Anyway, what I've got for you is way heavier than the<br/>stuff you were workin' on this afternoon.")
('Jack', 'Doubt blondie and the kid are ready for it, to<br/>be honest.')
('Van', 'Why do you think I came alone?')
('Van', "(Con artists working with A, huh? Yeah, that's a<br/>mess, all right.)")
('Van', 'Well, see ya around.')
('Jack', "You're goin' alone?")
('Van', "That's the plan.")
('Jack', "I know you're tough and all, but wanderin' around<br/>this town late at night by your lonesome ain't the<br/>brightest idea.")
('Jack', "Now—don't bite my head off—why not ask Elaine to<br/>come along?")
('Van', "Like I've got any right to do that...")
('Van', "I can handle this myself. I've got the best nose in the<br/>biz, y'know.")
('Jack', "Don't work that sniffer too hard, ya hear?")
('Halle', "Jack, what's going on?!")
('Jack', "Dunno, but I don't like it. Go hide out in the bar!")
('Ashen', "We shouldn't be getting sea fog at this time of year...")
('Fan', "Even if it's a freak off-season incident, it shouldn't be<br/>this dense.")
('Fan', 'Contact the other families! I need men stationed at<br/>every district!')
(40401, 'Yes, sir!')
('Houseman', "To think it'd return after forty long years...")
('Ashen', 'Yéye?')
('Fan', 'Are you saying this has happened before?')
('Houseman', "I'm not surprised you have forgotten. You were only a<br/>child when this fog last descended upon us.")
('Houseman', 'Assemble the xiongshou. We must fortify our<br/>defenses at once.')
('Huang', 'Hurry back to your homes!')
('Sei', "Stay in and don't come out! It's too<br/>dangerous outside!")
('Syd', "Hey! Do you know where Aaron is? I can't find<br/>him anywhere!")
('Huang', 'He went to go keep an eye on that outsider<br/>Heiyue hired.')
('Syd', "Wh-What about this fog? I've never seen<br/>anything lik—GUH!")
('Sei', 'Syd! Hang in there! Say something!')
('Huang', 'You bastards!')
(40352, "Well, lookie here! The whole bunch of 'em in<br/>one place.")
(40351, "Our job of paintin' these streets red just got a<br/>lot easier!")
(40351, 'Hahaha!')
('Aaron', 'Sei! Huang!')
('Aaron', 'Damn it all!')
('Van', 'Oh, great...')
('Elaine', "I'll take point!")
('Agnès', 'Wow!')
('Feri', "They're perfectly in sync!")
('Van', 'Look alive!')
('Elaine', "It's not over yet.")
('Agnès', 'What are they doing here...?')
('Feri', "Let's go!")
('Aaron', 'Outta my way!')
('Aaron', 'Argh. Go to hell!')
('Aaron', "Hang on, guys! I'm coming!")
('Aaron', '...Huh?')
('Feri', 'The enemy has been routed!')
('Agnès', '*pant*...*pant*... What if there are more hiding in<br/>the mist?')
('Van', "Don't think so—the fog's clearing.")
('Elaine', 'Did you hear that?')
('Feri', 'About ten people just fled the combat zone!')
('Van', 'We need to hurry!')
('Agnès', 'Oh, Aidios...')
('Feri', "This isn't even a battlefield...")
('Van', 'Stay back, both of you.')
('Elaine', "...Let's go make sure.")
('Van', "I...don't like these odds.")
('Ashen', 'Aaron...')
('Aaron', 'Those bastards...')
('Aaron', "...Even if it's the last thing I do...they're gonna—")
('Aaron', 'RAAAAAAH!')
('Aaron', "THEY'LL PAY! I'LL MAKE THEM<br/>ALL PAY!")
(500, 'The next morning...')

('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', 'Allow me to formally introduce myself. My name is<br/>Gien Lu.')
('Agnès', "'Lu'? Then, that makes you...")
('Van', "I figured there was more going on with you, but I<br/>wouldn't have guessed you were THAT important.")
('Van', "Can't believe an elder from Heiyue waxed my ride.")
('Feri', 'Wait... Oh, it IS the same guy!')
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', 'Heheh. You still have much to learn, young Van.')
('Van', "Weird hearing that from you, but I take it you didn't<br/>invite us just for that big reveal.")
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', "Of course. Naturally, we must discuss last<br/>night's events.")
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', "Allow me to inform you of the elders' decision.")
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', 'Heiyue will remain on standby until further notice.')
('Van', 'Even after that bloodbath?')
('Fan', 'Father, are you sure this is the most prudent course?')
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', 'Today, we must bide our time and prepare our forces.<br/>In the interim, no one must mount an attack.')
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', 'On the morrow, Cao will return, and we as an<br/>organization will resolve this matter in one fell swoop.')
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', 'Whether Yin chooses to help us is no longer relevant.')
('Ashen', 'How can you expect us to sit idly by and<br/>accept that?!')
('Ashen', 'Never mind the people of Langport! What<br/>about Aaron?')
('Ashen', "He's been missing ever since the incident. I know<br/>him—he's not about to sit on his hands and wait!")
('Ashen', 'Are you both really just going to let him go it alone?!')
('Fan', "Of course we don't want to abandon him.<br/>However, it's plain to see this situation is balanced on<br/>a knife's edge.")
('Fan', 'Our foes will expect retribution, so we only have one<br/>chance to get this right.')
('Ashen', '...')
('Van', 'I get what you mean.')
('Agnès', 'They must have an idea of what that retribution will<br/>look like—and a way to counter it.')
('Feri', "Yeah, I've seen traps like these before.")
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', "I see there's no need for me to explain further.")
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', 'However, I must append one note—a warning: leave<br/>this city by dawn tomorrow.')
('Van', "So that's when you're settin' loose your shadow<br/>warriors, huh?")
('Van', "I hear you didn't even send 'em out when you were<br/>beefing with the Red Constellation.")
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', "You are remarkably well informed. That altercation<br/>was simply a consequence of another family's<br/>poor decisions.")
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', 'Had Cao failed to quell the incursion, our shadows<br/>would have been released without a second thought.')
('Van', 'Lucky for everyone that jaegers have more sense than<br/>Almata, I guess.')
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', 'I am beginning to understand what Cao sees in you.<br/>Perhaps I will enlist your services again one day.')
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', 'With that, I bid you farewell. Fair travels on your<br/>return to the capital.')
('Agnès', '...?!')
('Feri', '...!')
('Ashen', "Wh-Why didn't you warn us they were here?!")
('Van', '...Got one last question for you, old man.')
('Van', "What's with the cold shoulder to the kid? He's been<br/>sulkin' about it.")
('Ashen', '...')
('Fan', '...')
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', 'Hmph.')
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', 'Simply put, Heiyue is a complex organization.')
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', 'This crisis presents an opportunity to let external<br/>woes reveal internal wounds.')
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', 'Perhaps you will understand this, too, in due time.')
('Fan', "Well, if the elders say we aren't acting today, then<br/>that's that.")
('Fan', "I'll leave it up to you to decide how and to what<br/>degree you investigate last night's tragedy.")
('Fan', 'My only request is that you look out for Aaron as<br/>much as possible.')
('Ashen', 'I feel the same. His friends were like family to him.')
('Ashen', "He'll be willing to pay any price to avenge them.")
('Feri', 'That makes sense. He was overtaken with<br/>rage before.')
('Agnès', "I'm worried about him being out there on his own.")
('Van', "Speakin' of worried, I'm gettin' worried about you<br/>gettin' back to Edith on time.")
('Van', "If you don't make it back in time, a certain bracer's<br/>gonna bite my head off.")
('Agnès', 'Sorry, but please let me stay until the end of the day.')
('Agnès', "There's something on my mind that I need to<br/>see through.")
('Van', "Figures. All right, you've got till the last train tonight.<br/>No more extensions.")
('Agnès', 'I understand.')
('Fan', "Do be careful, everyone. If you need support, we'll do<br/>what we can.")
('Fan', "I'm counting on you, Mr. Arkride.")
('Ashen', "Aaron's in your hands now.")
('Van', "So long as it's the kinda work a spriggan like me can<br/>do, I'll see this through.")
('Van', 'All right. Bet you already know the game plan for<br/>today, right?')
('Agnès', 'First, we need to investigate what happened last<br/>night—in particular, where that strange fog<br/>came from.')
('Agnès', "It's possible there is a Genesis involved.")
('Feri', 'We need to track down Aaron, too.')
('Feri', "For all we know, he's already charged headfirst into<br/>the enemy base.")
('Feri', 'That enemy likely being Almata.')
('Van', 'Not bad. You got all the big stuff.')
('Van', "While we work on the information gatherin', we'll<br/>knock out any other small tasks that come our way.")
('Van', "I wanna check in with Jack, too. And we may as well<br/>hit up the cops and the guild while we're at it.")
('Van', "Long story short, we've gotta roll with the punches.")
('Feri', 'Right!')
('Van', 'Hey, Jack. You got a sec?')
('Jack', 'Well, look who decided to drop by.')
('Van', "Been a little busy, as you might imagine. Let's get<br/>straight to it.")
('Van', 'A big warehouse was rented out the same day the<br/>Messeldam Trading Company moved in across town.')
('Van', 'I wanna know where it is, and who the renter is.')
('Jack', "Had a feelin' this might happen.")
('Van', 'What?')
('Jack', 'Aaron asked us the exact same thing this morning.')
('Halle', "He told us not to mention his visit, but since you<br/>know so much, there's no point hiding it now.")
('Feri', 'He was here?!')
('Agnès', "We've finally found his trail!")
('Jack', "As for the place, I started payin' attention when the<br/>realtor went belly up under suspicious circumstances.")
('Jack', 'That was about three weeks ago—around the end<br/>of August.')
('Jack', "Keepin' track of these kinda things is a side business<br/>of mine, so I kept my ears open and got a list of the<br/>realtor's other properties.")
('Halle', "Imagine my shock noticin' the guy croaked the same<br/>day Messeldam Trading Company moved in.")
('Halle', "The place was rented out by another realtor, so I<br/>didn't put the pieces together until our red-headed<br/>friend came knocking.")
('Feri', "So Aaron's been following the same line of logic as<br/>we have.")
('Agnès', 'And the realtor did end up being silenced after all...')
('Van', "So c'mon. Where is it? And who rented it?")
('Jack', "Startin' with question two, it was rented by the<br/>'Tharbad Transportation Company.'")
('Feri', 'Tharbad? As in the city in southeast Calvard?')
('Agnès', "That's right. Some call it the gate to the Central East.<br/>It makes sense that you're familiar with it.")
('Van', "Another generic company name, huh? Bet this one's a<br/>dummy, too.")
('Halle', 'Probably. When I looked into it, there were no records<br/>of a company registered with that name.')
('Halle', 'I never did figure out why they picked Tharbad of all<br/>places, though.')
('Jack', 'Coulda chose with a map and a dartboard for all<br/>we know. Anyway, back to question one.')
('Jack', 'Lemme send the location to your Xipha.')
('Van', "Heh. Ain't you prepared.")
('Van', "Hold on. It's at the wharf right next to<br/>New Town!")
('Feri', 'Really?!')
('Agnès', "Hmm. We haven't been there today...")
('Agnès', "...but I don't remember seeing anything strange the<br/>last time we were there.")
('Van', "All right. Let's get a move on.")
('Feri', 'Aye, aye!')
('Agnès', 'Thank you both for your help!')
('Jack', "I hesitated about tellin' you guys, to be honest.")
('Halle', "Aaron moved like a man possessed when he was here.<br/>Given what happened, I can't really blame him.")
('Halle', 'Please help him through all this if you can.')
('Van', "That's the plan. The Lu family already requested the<br/>same thing.")
('Agnès', 'We want to help him, too, of course.')
('Feri', 'You can count on us!')
(500, 'September 21st, 3:05PM')
('Feri', "I hope Aaron's going to be all right...")
('Agnès', "The doctor said his life isn't in danger, at least.")
('Agnès', "He's going to need to stay off his feet for a<br/>while, though.")
('Ashen', 'Thank you for bringing him back.')
('Van', 'Wish he was a little less battered and bruised.')
('Ashen', "What's important is that he's still alive.")
('Ashen', "Left to his own devices, he would've just kept fighting<br/>even if it cost him his life.")
('Jack', "*sigh* I knew he was a firebrand, but maybe he's just<br/>plain reckless.")
('Halle', "If the circumstances were any different, I think he'd<br/>have been more levelheaded.")
('Ashen', 'Yeah. This just goes to show how important his<br/>friends were to him...')
('Van', 'Either way, looks like an all-out war between Heiyue<br/>and Almata is inevitable now.')
('Van', 'And both sides are ready to throw down!')
('Feri', 'Those people we fought in the warehouse were<br/>strong, but do they really stand a chance<br/>against Heiyue?')
('Agnès', "I still can't believe they'd do...that to their<br/>own people...")
('Van', "Normally, I'd say hell no. Heiyue's got too much of<br/>an upper hand on their home turf.")
('Van', "Meaning A's gotta have an ace up their sleeve.")
('Van', "Something that's got them believin' they can take<br/>down Heiyue even with Yin in the fray.")
('Jack', "What're you thinkin'? That weird fog? Or is it<br/>somethin' else?")
('Van', 'Who knows.')
('Ashen', "Either way, we can't drag you into this any further.")
('Ashen', 'Once the fighting begins, Heiyue will hunt Almata to<br/>their last without a shred of mercy.')
('Ashen', 'Neither the police nor the guild will be able to<br/>intervene—and unfortunately, there will be casualties.')
('Feri', 'I see...')
('Agnès', '...')
('Jack', "At the very least, I'd wager Fan'll be thinkin' about<br/>the common folk. Can't say the same about<br/>Gien, though.")
('Jack', "The cops and the guild will be on the case, so I'd say<br/>your role in all this is over.")
('Jack', 'Why not call it a trip and head on home?')
('Halle', 'Jack...')
('Van', "You've got a point, I guess. Outta work reasons<br/>for stayin'.")
('Van', "Our other business 'round here can wait till this mess<br/>blows over.")
('Van', "Though, it'll just have to be me and Feri.")
('Agnès', 'Ah. I suppose so...')
('Feri', 'Agnès...')
('Aaron', 'Then how about I give you a reason to stick around?')
('Aaron', "I've got a job for you, spriggan!")
('Ashen', 'Aaron?!')
('Halle', "You shouldn't be out of bed yet—your wounds<br/>may reopen!")
('Aaron', "I don't have time to sit around and feel sorry<br/>for myself.")
('Aaron', "Almata and Heiyue are up to some shit.<br/>My friends are dead 'cause of it.")
('Aaron', "I couldn't avenge them on my own.")
('Aaron', 'All I have to show for my efforts are some new scars.')
('Aaron', "If I'd just teamed up with you, maybe my friends<br/>would still be alive.")
('Aaron', 'Those thugs in the warehouse, too.')
('Aaron', "They could've atoned and made something of<br/>their lives.")
('Feri', '...')
('Agnès', 'Aaron...')
('Aaron', 'What do I have to say to convince you?!')
('Aaron', 'Mom loved this town so much. And so did<br/>my friends...')
('Aaron', 'So please! Help me kick those bastards out of our<br/>town and make things right!')
('Ashen', 'Oh, Aaron...')
('Jack', 'Finally dropping the pride, huh?')
('Van', "I've got one condition.")
('Aaron', 'Huh?')
('Van', "We ain't killing anyone.")
('Van', "Goes for that pair of Almata execs, too. We either<br/>force 'em to retreat, or hand 'em over to Heiyue.")
('Aaron', "You've gotta be kidding me!")
('Van', "If you were a member of Heiyue, I wouldn't stop you.")
('Van', "But right now, you're just a nobody.")
('Van', "Ain't gonna let a kid who's still findin' his way<br/>become a murderer.")
('Aaron', '...!')
('Feri', '(Van...)')
('Agnès', '(Even with stakes this high, he never really changes,<br/>does he?)')
('Aaron', 'Fine. I accept your condition!')
('Ashen', "I'll try to figure out what Heiyue is planning—<br/>though, I may not be able to do much.")
('Halle', "We'll poke around and see if our contacts<br/>know anything.")
('Jack', "Don't plan on us swoopin' in to save you, all right?")
('Van', 'Heh. I know better than to bet on you.')
('Ashen', 'Listen, Aaron.')
('Ashen', "I know that if Auntie Yuefa were here, she'd let you<br/>go fight those monsters.")
('Ashen', "So I'm not going to stop you, either, but you better<br/>not die out there, okay?")
('Aaron', "It's a promise.")
('Assistant Shenli', 'Looking better already.')
('Eastern Medicine Dr. Longkai', "*sigh* I really didn't want to resort to using this salve.")
('Feri', 'Wow!')
('Agnès', 'You were limping and ragged just moments ago.')
('Van', 'What the heck did you put in that salve? Some kind<br/>of secret Eastern recipe?')
('Eastern Medicine Dr. Longkai', "Indeed. It's a precise blend of crushed dragon bone,<br/>Soul Moss, and Divine Powder.")
('Eastern Medicine Dr. Longkai', 'It revitalizes the body and dulls its pain receptors.')
('Assistant Shenli', 'However, there are big repercussions for you using it.')
('Assistant Shenli', "You'd better be ready to spend a couple of weeks in<br/>bed once this is over, Aaron.")
('Van', "Damn. That's some intense stuff.")
('Feri', "I could definitely use some in a pinch... It's a little<br/>scary sounding, though.")
('Aaron', "Bring it on. It'll take more than some medicine to<br/>stop the Crimson Khan.")
('Aaron', "...Actually, I'm done calling myself those<br/>edgy nicknames.")
('Aaron', 'Anyway, I owe you both big time.')
('Aaron', "It's no wonder Heiyue holds you guys in such<br/>high regard.")
('Eastern Medicine Dr. Longkai', "Heh. You really know how to butter an old doctor up,<br/>don't you?")
('Eastern Medicine Dr. Longkai', 'I must admit, I never imagined the two of you would<br/>end up working together, Arkride.')
('Eastern Medicine Dr. Longkai', "But look at him now, relying on outsiders through<br/>and through. It's hardly my place, but please<br/>help him.")
('Van', "Consider it me finally payin' you back.")
('Aaron', 'How the hell does this guy know everybody?<br/>Have you met before, Shenli?')
('Assistant Shenli', "We sure have. I've been hoping we could spar for a<br/>long time, even.")
('Van', "Gonna have to call a rain check on that one. I know<br/>you'd put up a real fight.")
('Feri', '(This city is so awesome! The food is great, and<br/>everyone is so strong!)')
('Agnès', '(I was right with you until that last point...)')
('Eastern Medicine Dr. Longkai', 'Well, Aaron. Arkride.')
('Eastern Medicine Dr. Longkai', 'The outsiders may be dangerous, but you should be<br/>wary of Elder Gien as well.')
('Eastern Medicine Dr. Longkai', 'His xiongshou are a force of nature.')
('Eastern Medicine Dr. Longkai', "Furthermore, he's also the oldest of Heiyue's elders<br/>who have long ruled this town. You would be wise<br/>not to underestimate him.")
('Aaron', 'Why do you think he warned us about Lǎo Yéye?')
('Van', 'Good question. Gien did give me that kinda<br/>vibe, though.')
('Van', "I also have a feelin' even one of his xiongshou would<br/>put up a hell of a fight.")
('Feri', 'Yeah...')
('Agnès', 'They seem to be as fearsome a force as Yin...')
('Aaron', "Eh, whatever. We're better off focusing on<br/>Almata anyway.")
('Aaron', "Much as I'd like to call the shots, though, you're in<br/>charge now.")
('Aaron', "So, what's the plan?")
('Van', "First off, there weren't enough thugs at the warehouse<br/>for that to be all of 'em.")
('Van', "Meanin' the rest, and maybe those execs, have gotta<br/>be somewhere else.")
('Agnès', 'So you think they have yet another base in the city?')
('Feri', 'That makes sense. They need somewhere big to<br/>prepare their forces.')
('Aaron', "There aren't many places they could be, though.")
('Aaron', "The Eastern Quarter's outta the question, and<br/>Heiyue's got their eyes on New Town now.")
('Aaron', 'And after all the shit that went down at the docks, we<br/>can probably rule there out, too.')
('Agnès', 'What about the naval port next to it?')
('Agnès', 'Though, that would mean the navy is somehow<br/>involved in all this, which is...disconcerting to say<br/>the least.')
('Feri', "Hmm... That's definitely a possibility.")
('Aaron', "Well, damn. The little lady's got a dark imagination.")
('Van', "I would've thought Heiyue'd have the navy in their<br/>back pocket by now.")
('Van', 'What do you think?')
('Aaron', "Fan's been greasing the navy's palms for a while now.<br/>Far as I know, they're still loyal to Heiyue.")
('Aaron', "They've got folks on the inside, too. Something this<br/>big wouldn't go unnoticed.")
('Agnès', "I see... That option's off the table, then.")
('Agnès', '(The navy being bribed by one group and not the<br/>other is hardly comforting, though...)')
('Van', "Well, it's just past four. We've still got time left.")
('Van', "All right. It's time for a practical exam, kid.")
('Van', 'I showed you how we work last night.')
('Van', "You've got till this evening to find us those mobsters.")
('Aaron', '...Huh?')
('Van', "My instincts are tellin' me we have almost all the<br/>pieces we need to find their other base.")
('Van', "But I've got a hunch what we're missin' is something<br/>only you can find.")
('Van', "You've lived here the longest and know this place's<br/>scent like the back of your hand.")
('Van', "So we'll back you up, but I'm handin' you the reins on<br/>this case.")
('Aaron', '...')
('Aaron', "Heh. Sniffing around like a dog isn't my style...")
('Aaron', "...but what the hell. I'm not about to pass up a chance<br/>to steal your thunder!")
('Van', "Heh. Ain't you a smartass?")
('Agnès', "I'll need to catch my train later, but I can help<br/>until then!")
('Feri', "Then what are we waiting for? Let's go!")
('System', 'Aaron joined the party.')
('System', 'After they finished asking around, the group<br/>reconvened to consider their findings.')
('Van', "...Think you've got it?")
('Aaron', 'Yeah. Those bastards got us good.')
('Aaron', "Picking somewhere us folks in the Eastern Quarter<br/>are so used to seeing that we don't even think<br/>about it.")
('Aaron', "Or more accurately, somewhere we were told not to<br/>think about because it's supposed to be cursed.")
('Agnès', 'Heilong Cheng Zhai...')
('Agnès', 'A large-scale mining facility where droves of miners<br/>lived and worked until forty years ago.')
('Aaron', "Yeah. Now it's deserted, and all you hear about it<br/>are all sorts of creepy stories.")
('Aaron', 'People here grow up being told to stay the hell out<br/>because the place is haunted with ghosts and demons<br/>and shit.')
('Feri', 'We learned that those rumors were first spread by the<br/>elders of Heiyue.')
('Feri', 'And not even the police or guild would go there<br/>because nobody lives there anymore.')
('Van', "Makeshift bases don't get much better than<br/>that place.")
('Van', "For someone who doesn't like sniffin' around, you've<br/>got a hell of a nose. Nice work, kid.")
('Aaron', 'Heh.')
('Maxim', 'Fancy running into you again!')
('Feri', "It's the red...something!")
('Van', "What's with the shades?")
('Maxim', 'I wear them to suppress my natural charm.<br/>Though, since you recognized me, it seems my star<br/>power is undeniable.')
('Aaron', "(Who's this guy think he is? Wait... This dumbass<br/>was at last night's show.)")
(40301, 'Hold the phone... Is that Aaron?!')
(40302, 'It totally is!')
('Aaron', "Figures we'd bump into some fans eventually.")
('Maxim', "Come now, girls. You'll make me jealous if you stare<br/>too much.")
(40301, "Aww, we didn't mean to, Maxi-poo!")
(40302, 'We only have eyes for you!')
('Maxim', "Well, I'll admit he's not too bad, but doesn't hold a<br/>candle to me, naturally.")
('Maxim', "...Wait, why do I feel like I've seen your face<br/>somewhere before?")
('Aaron', 'Gee, I wonder.')
(40301, '(He totally has no clue, does he?)')
(40302, "(Imagine if he knew the 'girl' he was catcalling at the<br/>theater was Aaron...)")
('Maxim', "No time for pondering. We're about to set off on a<br/>little adventure, you see.")
('Maxim', "That darn reporter took up so much of my time<br/>yesterday that I've got to make up for lost<br/>time tonight!")
('Agnès', 'Ahaha... That sounds rough.')
('Maxim', "I know, why don't I treat you girls to a nice dinner<br/>when we get back?")
('Maxim', "As for the men... Well, I'm sure we can spare<br/>some schnibbles.")
('Maxim', "Start your engines, ladies! I've got to show off my<br/>wide array of driving skills on the way to the sea cave!")
(40302, 'Really?!')
(40301, "You're the best!")
('Van', "Guy's got a boatin' license, I guess. Funny that we're<br/>kinda headed that way, too.")
('Feri', "The two places aren't that close together, though, so I<br/>doubt we'll run into them again.")
('Agnès', "Right. I hope they don't have any trouble with<br/>the monsters...")
('Aaron', "Meh. They'll have a guide. Let the blond idiot do<br/>his thing.")
('Aaron', "We've got to focus on Heilong Cheng Zhai. This shit<br/>ends today.")
('Aaron', "I'm counting on you, Van!")
('Van', 'Course. What about you two?')
('Agnès', "We're coming, too. I have a feeling my other goal<br/>might be there as well.")
('Feri', "Once we're ready, we should hurry to the dock!")
('Van', 'Bah. You best be ready for ANYTHING, got it?!')
('Van', "We'll be sailin' right into the belly of the beast.<br/>Are we ready?")
('System', 'Choosing to embark toward Heilong Cheng Zhai<br/>will advance the main story.')
('System', 'As a result, all unfinished quests and unseen<br/>sub-events will disappear.')
(500, 'September 21st, 5:02PM')
('Aaron', "So, who's driving?")
('Aaron', "I'm happy to do it, but I don't want to hear any<br/>whining when I put the pedal to the metal.")
('Feri', 'Sounds fun!')
('Agnès', "Umm. I-I'd prefer if you were a little more careful.")
('Van', "You've got a license, huh?")
('Van', "If we bomb in at top speed, they'll notice us for sure.<br/>Lemme show you how it's done.")
('Aaron', 'Have it your way.')
('Elaine', 'Mind if I tag along as well?')
('Feri', 'Huh?')
('Agnès', "You know where we're going?")
('Elaine', "Heilong Cheng Zhai: Almata's base and—if we don't<br/>hurry—tomorrow's battlefield.")
('Van', "Nice sleuthin'.")
('Elaine', 'I owe this hypothesis to the others at the guild.')
('Elaine', "Since you all are here, too, it would seem I'm on the<br/>right track.")
('Feri', 'No hiding it now.')
('Van', 'You sure a bracer should be taking this on, though?')
('Van', "Figure Heiyue wouldn't take kindly to that.")
('Elaine', 'Civilians died last night. Our code demands action.')
('Elaine', "We can't allow any further bloodshed—be it innocent<br/>bystander or otherwise.")
('Elaine', "Furthermore, you've chosen to bring ordinary people<br/>into this. So, I'm going, and that's final.")
('Agnès', 'We appreciate the help.')
('Van', "Hold on, Elaine. I know you've already made up your<br/>mind, but we've gotta clear this with our client.")
('Van', 'Whaddaya say, chief?')
('Aaron', 'Yesterday, I saw exactly how strong you really<br/>are firsthand.')
('Aaron', "If you'd asked me this morning, I'd have told you to<br/>piss off.")
('Aaron', "Now... I'm not about to bat away a helping hand.")
('Agnès', 'Heehee.')
('Feri', "You'll be a real help!")
('Aaron', "But let me make one thing clear: I'm not some little<br/>pup that needs protecting.")
('Aaron', "I've got the weight of the whole city on my shoulders<br/>right now.")
('Elaine', '...!')
('Van', 'Heh.')
('Aaron', "I'm leading the charge here, so you better not look<br/>down on me, you old—")
('Aaron', "...pro who's much more skilled than me.")
('Elaine', 'Perish the thought.')
('Feri', "(I didn't even see her loose her blade.)")
('Agnès', "(So, uh, aren't you and Elaine the same age?<br/>Twenty-four, I believe.)")
('Van', "(Yeah. She's a bit more touchy about it than I<br/>am, though.)")
('Elaine', "It's clear from your story that there's more going on<br/>here than you're letting on.")
('Elaine', 'And while we managed to avoid the worst-case<br/>scenario, people lost their lives here.')
('Elaine', "Considering that, it's becoming increasingly difficult<br/>to ignore your participation in all of this, Agnès.")
('Elaine', "It doesn't have to be right this moment, but please<br/>consider having the guild take over this case of<br/>yours, okay?")
('Feri', "I don't see anything that looks super urgent.")
('Van', 'Me, neither.')
('Van', 'We have our pick of the litter.')
('Van', '...')
('Agnès', 'Is something the matter, Van?')
('Van', "Nah. I was just thinkin' back on old times.")
('Van', "When I first came here, I was just a greenhorn, and<br/>now I'm the one leading greenhorns on my<br/>return trip.")
('Van', 'Life comes at you fast. In both good and bad ways.')
('Feri', 'Abi once said the very same thing to me.')
('Feri', "I had no idea what he meant—and I still don't—but<br/>that's okay. I always love hearing wise old<br/>man sayings!")
('Van', "I'll pretend I didn't hear the 'old man' part.")
('Van', "Anyway, let's get to work. We'll probably run into<br/>some familiar faces along the way.")
('Van', 'Hey, Jack. You look better than you usually do this<br/>time of morning.')
('Jack', "I'll take that as a compliment.")
('Jack', "I just figured that now's not the best time to<br/>be hungover.")
('Halle', 'How are you guys holding up?')
('Agnès', "We're doing okay, given the circumstances.<br/>What about you?")
('Halle', "I won't lie, I'm pretty shaken up. Some of the victims<br/>were regulars of ours.")
('Halle', "But you don't need to worry about me. I'll be fine.")
('Van', 'If you say so...')
('Van', 'Is there anything you can tell us about the victims?')
('Jack', "A little, though probably nothing you don't<br/>already know. The thing they all had in common was<br/>that they were friends of Aaron's.")
('Jack', "And now, he's out for blood. Either he wants to get<br/>revenge for them...")
('Van', '...or he wants to make a declaration of war on A.')
('Feri', '...?!')
('Agnès', '...')
('Van', "I'm worried about him flyin' off the handle and doin'<br/>something he'd regret.")
('Van', 'You guys have any idea where he is? Has he<br/>dropped by?')
('Halle', 'Well...')
('Jack', "We haven't been able to locate him, no.")
('Jack', "Could be that he's at the clinic. They're treating the<br/>sole survivor of the attack as we speak.")
('Jack', 'Might be worth checking that place out.')
('Van', 'Nah, we already went. They said we just missed him.')
('Van', "Good idea. We'll head over there later.")
('Jack', "I don't have any other info for you. Wish I could've<br/>been more help.")
('Van', "Nah, it's cool. If you learn anything new, hit me up.")
('Jack', 'You got it.')
('Eastern Medicine Dr. Longkai', 'You here to visit him, too, Arkride?')
('Van', "Yeah. Jack told me that someone survived the attack.<br/>Guessin' he's that someone.")
('Van', "Wait... That's one of Aaron's friends. Did he survive<br/>the attack?")
('Eastern Medicine Dr. Longkai', "Yes. The fact that he's still breathing is nothing short<br/>of a miracle.")
('Agnès', "So he's going to make it?")
('Feri', 'His condition looks stable, at least.')
('Van', 'He gonna wake up anytime soon?')
('Eastern Medicine Dr. Longkai', "I don't know. The boy has yet to regain<br/>consciousness. He just barely managed to<br/>hang on.")
('Eastern Medicine Dr. Longkai', "There's a limit to what I can do here. I plan on having<br/>him moved to a hospital immediately.")
('Eastern Medicine Dr. Longkai', 'Heiyue is handling things on that end, thankfully.')
('Agnès', "I'm relieved that someone survived...but it's doubtful<br/>that we'll be able to ask him about what happened.")
('Van', "Yeah, it's too bad. We might've gotten some good<br/>info from him.")
('Eastern Medicine Dr. Longkai', "It looks like he lost consciousness from a blow to the<br/>back of the head. It's possible he didn't even see the<br/>attacker's face.")
('Van', "The killers probably didn't realize he was<br/>just unconscious. Might be the only reason he's<br/>still alive.")
('Feri', "Hope he doesn't have survivor's guilt after this...")
('Eastern Medicine Dr. Longkai', 'I can only treat the physical wounds. Whether his<br/>mental scars will heal is entirely up to him.')
('Van', 'By the way, has Aaron come by to visit?')
('Eastern Medicine Dr. Longkai', 'He came at sunrise, but he left shortly after.')
('Agnès', 'Do you have any idea where he went?')
('Eastern Medicine Dr. Longkai', "Not in the slightest. He didn't say a word the entire<br/>time, which is very unlike him.")
('Eastern Medicine Dr. Longkai', 'He must be tormenting himself...')
('Van', 'Yeah...')
('Eastern Medicine Dr. Longkai', 'Try and help him if you can. He needs to be<br/>surrounded by friends now more than ever.')
('Feri', 'Right.')
('Agnès', "We'll make sure he's okay.")
('Halle', 'Oh, hey, you guys.')
('Aaron', "Huh? What're you doing here, Ashen?")
('Ashen', "I'm just exchanging some information with them.")
('Van', "Did y'all figure anything out?")
('Jack', 'Patience, bud. Barely any time has passed since you<br/>last came here.')
('Jack', "That said, I'm startin' to piece things together—<br/>thanks in no small part to Heiyue.")
('Agnès', 'Really?!')
('Feri', "Can you share what you've learned so far?")
('Ashen', "I suppose that can't hurt.")
('Ashen', 'After we learned about the storehouse, Jack, Halle,<br/>and I spoke with the realtors in Langport.')
('Ashen', "The only places that seemed suspect were the<br/>Messeldam Trading Company's building and<br/>that storehouse.")
('Agnès', 'Are you sure those are the only possible hideouts?')
('Halle', "We're pretty sure. The three of us pored through all<br/>the contracts over the last few months.")
('Halle', '...Although, I guess they could have purchased a place<br/>over a year ago, now that I think about it.')
('Ashen', "I think that's unlikely.")
('Ashen', "If a large piece of real estate was bought and left alone<br/>for that long, Heiyue would've known about it.")
('Van', 'What if they rented multiple small to medium-size<br/>properties instead?')
('Ashen', "Hmm... If they did that, then yes, it would've escaped<br/>our notice.")
('Jack', 'Even still, I doubt they made that play.')
('Jack', "While it's true that they could've duped Heiyue with<br/>the paperwork, the civilians would've known<br/>somethin' was up.")
('Jack', 'Most of the small to medium-size properties are in<br/>the Residential District and the Business District.')
('Jack', "There's a lotta people coming and going in<br/>those places.")
('Van', "Right. If there was a bunch of abandoned sites all<br/>over the place, they'd have known about it.")
('Aaron', "And they'd be talking about it, too. No way they'd<br/>keep quiet on account of some shithead gangsters.")
('Aaron', 'Also, Heiyue would know if the people were<br/>being threatened.')
('Feri', 'Feels like we hit a brick wall...')
('Jack', "For the record, when I said I was piecin' things<br/>together, I just meant I had chucked a few<br/>possibilities off the game board.")
('Halle', 'Sorry, you guys. Wish we had more to share.')
('Agnès', "No, no. You've all been a huge help.")
('Van', "Thanks to you, we're gettin' closer to solving<br/>this mystery.")
('Van', 'Call us up if you figure anything else out.')
('Jack', 'Will do. Just watch your asses out there, all right?')
('Pao', 'Oh, Heavenly Mother... Have mercy on us.')
('Pao', "Please calm the Tyrant's rage...")
('Pao', 'This must be our punishment. Langport...<br/>Langport is...')
('Van', 'Uhh... You okay, Pao?')
('Aaron', "What's with all the doom and gloom?")
('Pao', "Van, Aaron... Oh, it's just too cruel...")
('Pao', "You shouldn't have to bear the weight of our sins...<br/>Why must you suffer for our wrongdoing...")
('Agnès', "Everything's going to be okay, ma'am. No one here<br/>is suffering.")
('Pao', 'That mist brought back memories from that horrific<br/>day forty years ago...')
('Pao', "I'm certain his fury has rekindled due to the taboo.")
('Pao', "This is all divine retribution for our sins. I'm so sorry<br/>that you all will pay the price, too...")
('Feri', "Okay, I'm totally lost. What do you mean by 'taboo'<br/>and 'divine retribution'?")
('Pao', "It's...umm... I mustn't say!")
('Pao', "This city's abominable history will be buried with us.<br/>It cannot be passed to the next generation.")
('Van', "Okay... Well, if you don't wanna share, we won't<br/>force you.")
('Van', "In any case, we'll take care of the mist.")
('Agnès', "That's right. We've even gathered a few leads on it.")
('Aaron', "You can leave it to us. I'm not gonna let anything<br/>happen to this city.")
('Aaron', "So keep your chin up, Pao. I can't stand seeing you<br/>like this.")
('Pao', 'I... I understand. Thank you for reassuring me.')
('Pao', "You've grown up so much, Aaron. You remind me so<br/>much of her when she was younger...")
('Pao', "Promise me you'll be careful, okay?")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Aha! Found you!')
('Van', 'Here we go again...')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "I've been looking all over for you guys!")
('Agnès', 'You have? Why?')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "What do you mean, 'why?' Because of what happened<br/>last night, of course!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'I heard you guys arrived at the scene super quick.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "I want the full lowdown, and I'm not leaving until<br/>you give me all the juicy details!")
('Aaron', 'Uhh. Who the hell is this chick?')
('Feri', "She's a reporter lady.")
('Aaron', "Got'cha. Word of advice, little girl. You should stick<br/>your nose someplace else—or you're gonna wind<br/>up hurt.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "L-Little girl?! I'll have you know I'm twenty-one!")
('Aaron', "Wait, are you seriously older than me? Damn, girl.<br/>You're rocking a real baby face there.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Anyway, it's my duty to find the truth and report it to<br/>the world!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "So I'm gonna stick to you like glue until I get a story I<br/>can print.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "I wasted all of yesterday pursuing a dead lead, so I've<br/>got to make up for lost time!")
('Agnès', 'Yeah... That was definitely on us.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "I'm also just curious on a personal level. That mist last<br/>night was so unsettling.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Maybe it really did come from a ghost ship...')
('Van', "Wait. What'd you just say?")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Huh? I said the mist was unsettling.')
('Van', 'No, the part after that.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Oh, I was wondering if the mist came from a<br/>ghost ship...')
('Agnès', 'Why would you assume that?')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'When that mist showed up, I peered out at the ocean,<br/>and I could just barely make out the silhouette of<br/>a ship.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "I couldn't find any other witnesses at the harbor...")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'But I know what I saw, and it was totally a<br/>ghost ship!')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "There's also a legend about it: 'The crew of every<br/>merchant vessel that crosses paths with a ghost ship in<br/>the mist will be slaughtered.'")
('Feri', 'Th-That sounds scary!')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "I KNOW I'm right! I've just gotta be!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "There's one teensy little snag in my theory, though.<br/>The ship was kinda...small. It's a far cry from the<br/>giant, hulking ghost ship I imagined.")
('Van', "That's not the only snag.")
('Van', "If it slaughters the crew of every ship it comes across,<br/>no one could've lived to tell the tale. So how'd the<br/>story come about?")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Uhh... W-Well, maybe a super amazing reporter<br/>found out about it...somehow.')
('Agnès', "There's another thing. I believe the mist mostly<br/>appeared on land—not the ocean.")
('Agnès', "Are you sure you weren't just seeing things?")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', '*sigh* I guess it was pretty dark that night. Maybe my<br/>eyes were playing tricks on me after all...')
('Van', "Sorry to burst your bubble. We also don't have much<br/>to share about the incident last night.")
('Van', "Might be better off pokin' the cops or the bracers.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Aww... Fine. I'll let you off the hook this time.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'But if you happen to find any leads, please let me in<br/>on it!')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'This is my time to shine! When this story lands on<br/>the front page, Dingo will HAVE to take notice<br/>of me!')
('Agnès', "Okay, that time you really did lie to her, Van.<br/>That's not right.")
('Van', "Hey, if you ask me, I'm being nice. Even if I did spill<br/>the beans, she wouldn't have been able to report on<br/>the info.")
('Van', "It's also in her best interest to stay far, faaar away<br/>from the mafia.")
('Agnès', "I guess I can't argue with you there.")
('Van', "Anyway, you look like you're having a light-bulb<br/>moment, Aaron.")
('Aaron', 'Yep. Her story helped me put two and two together<br/>on something.')
('Feri', "Well, don't keep us in suspense. Share!")
('Aaron', "Fact of the matter is, there shouldn't be any ships out<br/>and about in Langport at night.")
('Aaron', "I can count the number of times I've seen that on<br/>one hand.")
('Aaron', "And if the people at the harbor didn't see it, then this<br/>definitely sounds fishy.")
('Agnès', 'Do you suspect the gangsters escaped Langport in<br/>a boat?')
('Agnès', "If that's the case, it's no wonder Heiyue can't<br/>find them. They've had their eyes on land this<br/>whole time.")
('Aaron', 'Nah, I doubt they fled. They have to be close by.')
('Aaron', 'Probably just waiting for this whole thing to blow<br/>over before they strike Langport again.')
('Feri', 'But where would they set up shop?')
('Aaron', "There's only one place I can think of.")
('Aaron', "I think they're holed up on a remote island.<br/>Outsiders wouldn't know about it since it's off<br/>the map.")
('Aaron', 'The old fossils around here refuse to talk about it, but<br/>it comes up in rumors every now and then.')
('Aaron', "It's an abandoned mining town called Heilong<br/>Cheng Zhai.")
('Van', "We'll need to talk with the ferryman and see if he'll<br/>let us borrow a boat.")
('Aaron', 'I can handle that.')
('System', 'You can now travel to Heilong Cheng Zhai.')
('Van', "Hey. We're here to look into that Neil guy's request.")
('Pao', "Hoho. Good to hear. He's in quite a bind, so he could<br/>use your help.")
('Van', 'So, he a friend of yours or something?')
('Pao', 'Not quite. Neil is a traveler of sorts. He had a<br/>troubled look on his face, so I called out to him.')
('Pao', "That's when I learned he was being pursued<br/>by Heiyue.")
('Pao', 'It all seemed like a big misunderstanding, so I wanted<br/>to assist him however I could.')
('Feri', 'What?! How did he become a target of Heiyue?')
('Agnès', 'Did he do something bad?')
('Pao', "I think it'd be faster if you heard the details straight<br/>from the horse's mouth.")
('Pao', 'Also, you never know who may be listening in<br/>out here.')
('Van', 'Then how about we meet in our room back at<br/>Guihua Fandian?')
('Van', 'Doubt Heiyue would be able to eavesdrop on<br/>us there.')
('Pao', 'An excellent idea.')
('Pao', "I'll tell Neil to head over right away.")
('Pao', 'Or would that be a problem? Do you want me to<br/>contact him now or later?')
('Van', 'Well...')
('Pao', "It'd be best if you heard the details of the request<br/>directly from Neil.")
('Pao', 'Would it be a problem if I got in touch with<br/>him now?')
('Van', 'Sorry, but could you hold off for a bit?')
('Pao', "That's no problem at all.")
('Pao', 'Though bear in mind, the situation will only get<br/>worse as time goes by.')
('Pao', 'The sooner I can get in touch with him and get this<br/>underway, the better.')
('Van', 'Go right ahead.')
('Pao', 'Very well, then.')
('System', 'Quest Special Delivery started!')
('Neil', "It's a pleasure to meet you all. My name is Neil.")
('Van', "And I'm Van from Arkride Solutions. These two are<br/>my assistants.")
('Van', "Let's get right into it. Can you give us the details of<br/>your request?")
('Van', "We heard from Pao that you're being pursued<br/>by Heiyue.")
('Neil', "Yes, that's right. I can't even walk around outside...")
('Neil', "...and it's all because of this stupid package.")
('Agnès', "Can you tell us what's inside of it?")
('Neil', "Yeah. I checked the contents when I got it, and it's<br/>full of Central Eastern sweets.")
('Neil', 'However, when I looked into it more with Pao, we<br/>discovered that it has a detachable bottom, which<br/>hides a white powder.')
('Neil', "I think it's some kind of narcotic.")
('Agnès', 'A-A narcotic?!')
('Feri', "Heiyue's banned the trade of drugs in Langport.")
('Feri', "No wonder they're after you.")
('Van', "I can tell you aren't a dealer based on how you're<br/>talkin' about this.")
('Van', "So how'd you get your hands on that case?")
('Neil', "It's a long story, but I don't mind telling it if it'll help.")
('Neil', 'This all started four days ago when I was still in the<br/>Central East.')
('Neil', 'Traveling around the world is a hobby of mine,<br/>you see.')
('Neil', 'But just as my trip was coming to an end, I ran<br/>into someone.')
('Neil', 'This person asked me if I wanted to do a simple job<br/>for them...')
('Neil', '...which was to take this case back with me to<br/>the Republic.')
('Feri', 'And you accepted it?')
('Neil', 'Of course. I had no way of knowing it had<br/>narcotics inside.')
('Neil', "I thought it'd be easy money—and I was excited at<br/>the prospect of turning my hobby into paid work.")
('Neil', "I was told to deliver this case to Langport, and that's<br/>why I'm here now.")
('Neil', 'Before I could make the delivery, though, Heiyue<br/>started chasing me.')
('Neil', "I had no idea what was going on. I probably would've<br/>gotten myself caught had Pao not hid me.")
('Van', "*sigh* That's a fine mess you've landed yourself in—<br/>and the old lady's dragged herself into it, too.")
('Van', 'Okay, so that covers how you got here.')
('Van', 'I want to know more about the orders you were given<br/>regarding the case.')
('Van', 'Your answer could change how we deal with this<br/>issue dramatically.')
('Neil', "W-Well... There's been a recent development<br/>regarding that.")
('Neil', 'The person who gave me the job contacted me a few<br/>hours ago. After I told them that Heiyue was chasing<br/>me, they gave me more orders.')
('Neil', 'They told me to drop the case off at a designated<br/>time and place.')
('Agnès', 'Sounds like they want to do a hand off.')
('Agnès', 'They must have started panicking when they heard<br/>that Heiyue is on their tracks.')
('Feri', 'So what should we do from here?')
('Van', 'Simple. We take the goods and do the exchange in<br/>his stead.')
('Van', "We'll lure the guy out of the shadows and hand them<br/>off to Heiyue. End of story.")
('Neil', "Huh?! A-Are you insane! That's suicide!")
('Agnès', "It's a risky plan, but I don't see any other alternative.")
('Agnès', 'If you want us to properly get rid of the drugs and<br/>ensure your safety, this is the only way.')
('Feri', 'I volunteer myself to handle the transfer!')
('Feri', 'I think that would be a good experience for me.')
('Van', "Hmm... They might let their guard down when they<br/>see a kid doin' the transfer.")
('Van', "All right. This one's all yours, Ferida.")
('Feri', 'Roger!')
('Agnès', "Okay, let's hurry to the drop-off point.")
('Van', "You stay here. I'd rather you not wander around until<br/>we get you off the hook.")
('Neil', 'Works for me.')
('Neil', "The designated location is the park area in New<br/>Town. They said to put the case under one of the<br/>benches that's facing the sea.")
('Neil', 'Good luck out there, you guys.')
('Neil', 'What?! You negotiated with Heiyue?! THE Heiyue?!')
('Van', "Yeah. You're banned from entering Langport for the<br/>next year.")
('Feri', 'Just to be safe, you should probably leave the city as<br/>soon as you can.')
('Neil', "I see. That's unfortunate, but it's not a huge deal.<br/>I'm not even a resident of this city.")
('Neil', "I'm just glad I won't have to be looking over my<br/>shoulder anymore. Thank you so much!")
('Neil', 'What?! You fought Heiyue—and won?!')
('Neil', "I'm so sorry for all the trouble I've caused you all.")
('Neil', "I can't thank you enough! I mean, you saved my life!")
('Agnès', "It was nothing. I'm just glad things worked out.")
('Feri', 'Now you can walk around Langport without<br/>worrying about Heiyue breathing down your neck!')
('Van', "Hope you've learned your lesson. No more sketchy<br/>gigs, all right?")
('Neil', 'Of course, of course.')
('Pao', "I'm happy things worked out for the best.")
('Pao', 'I knew you and your assistants could get the job<br/>done, Van.')
('Pao', 'Consider this a small token of my gratitude.')
('System', 'Obtained 3 <br/>.')
('Feri', 'Wow! Sweets! Thanks so much!')
('Van', "Come on, now. I ain't a kid anymore.")
('Pao', "As far as I'm concerned, you still are.")
('Agnès', "Heehee. It's not every day I get to see Van be treated<br/>like a kid.")
('Neil', "I'll wire the money to you guys soon.")
('Neil', 'Again, thank you all very much!')
('Neil', "That includes you, too, Pao. I surely would've been<br/>snatched away by Heiyue had you not stepped in.")
('Neil', 'Might be a year or so before I can stop by to visit...')
('Neil', "...but I'll make sure to bring some souvenirs from<br/>home when I do.")
('Neil', "The next time I come to Langport, I'll bring you<br/>some souvenirs from back home.")
('Pao', "I'll be looking forward to it.")
('Pao', 'Take care, everyone.')
('System', 'Quest Special Delivery completed!')
('System', 'Received')
('System', "In sub-event[SB_02_02_00][Downtown Unlocked to<br/>Ashen's Request], the main quest is commissioned, so<br/>we likely won't use this.")
('Ashen', "Hello? It's me, Ashen.")
('Ashen', 'I got your contact information from Bàbà. Do you<br/>have a minute?')
('Van', "Yeah, sure. What's up?")
('Ashen', 'I wanted to make a request to you guys.')
('Ashen', 'One of our subsidiaries is a sightseeing company, and<br/>monsters have been popping up at their tour site.')
('Agnès', 'Is this place far away?')
('Ashen', "No, it's still in Langport.")
('Ashen', "You can get all the details from Shou at the wharf.<br/>He's a ferryman.")
('Ashen', "I'll give you all a nice reward if you take it on. Plus I<br/>think you'll have a fun time as well.")
('Van', "Got it. We'll think about it.")
('Feri', "What do you think she meant when she said we'd<br/>have a fun time?")
('Feri', "Maybe because we'd get to test ourselves<br/>against monsters?")
('Agnès', "Perhaps. Let's go ask the ferryman for more details.")
('Ferryman Shou', 'Oh, you came! I heard everything from Lady Ashen.')
('Ferryman Shou', 'She asked you guys to get rid of that monster, yeah?')
('Van', "That's right. So where do we need to go?")
('Ferryman Shou', "Did Lady Ashen not tell you? It's on a remote island<br/>called the Eroded Cave.")
('Agnès', 'Ah, I heard about that place when I came here<br/>sightseeing in the past.')
('Agnès', "Not only is the landscape breathtaking, it has some<br/>mysterious legends surrounding it. It's quite<br/>popular, apparently.")
('Ferryman Shou', "Yep. But sadly, no one's allowed to go there<br/>right now.")
('Ferryman Shou', 'The island became infested with monsters after that<br/>big one appeared.')
('Ferryman Shou', 'Naturally, tours there have been delayed<br/>indefinitely—at least until we can exterminate<br/>those vermin.')
('Van', 'And you want us to be their exterminators?')
('Van', "Ashen did say that Heiyue's people would handle it if<br/>we couldn't...")
('Feri', 'But they asked for our help, so I say we do it!')
('Ferryman Shou', 'Haha. Just take some time to think it over.')
('Ferryman Shou', "If there isn't any leeway in your schedule, then it's<br/>all good.")
('Ferryman Shou', 'You can use this boat to head there if you decide to<br/>accept the job.')
('Ferryman Shou', "A tour guide will be waiting for you there.<br/>They'll make sure you don't get lost.")
('Agnès', "That's very considerate. Thank you!")
('Van', "All right. We'll let you know what we decide in a bit.")
('Van', 'Heiyue is asking us to exterminate a large monster in<br/>the Eroded Cave.')
('Van', 'Should we take the gig?')
('Caroline', 'So beyond that gate lies the legendary Eastern<br/>Quarter, right?')
('Caroline', "It's like the whole townscape is sheathed<br/>in vermillion! How wonderful!")
('Van', 'Yeah. The entire street was constructed according to<br/>the architectural style of the East.')
('Agnès', 'The lights that come from the lanterns and the<br/>wooden buildings give this place a warm,<br/>cozy ambience.')
('Feri', "The Eastern Quarter is both gorgeous<br/>and welcoming! You're gonna love it!")
('Caroline', 'So where should we go first? Shall we explore<br/>this street?')
('Van', "Hmm... We'll definitely want to hit the shops at<br/>some point.")
('Van', 'But before that, I think we should check out the<br/>Eastern Theater.')
('Caroline', "Oh? I've never heard of that before.")
('Agnès', "Heehee. She's in for a surprise.")
('Feri', "It's a place that puts on performances. We saw a show<br/>there earlier, and it was AWESOME!")
('Caroline', 'My, that sounds delightful!')
('Van', "It's right over there. We'll tell you more about it once<br/>we're inside.")
('Caroline', "Oh, my! It's awfully crowded in here!")
('Caroline', 'Is a performance about to start soon? Or has one just<br/>wrapped up?')
('Feri', 'The latter, sadly.')
('Feri', "If you have some spare time later, I'd recommend<br/>coming back and watching one of their shows.<br/>They're a real treat!")
('Caroline', "I'll certainly consider it.")
('Caroline', 'So what sort of performances do they put on here?')
('Caroline', 'Do they host operas and musicals?')
('Van', 'Nah, they do Eastern performance art.')
('Van', 'The shows have singing in them, but the sword<br/>dancing is the main draw.')
('Caroline', 'Sword dancing? My word.')
('Caroline', "They don't do anything of the sort at the opera house<br/>in Oración.")
('Agnès', 'Well, operas mainly just need amazing singers, and<br/>Oración has those in spades.')
('Agnès', 'The Eastern Theater requires a little more<br/>performative flair that can complement their<br/>elaborate narratives and set designs.')
('Van', "And one of their dancers delivers the secret spice with<br/>finesse, and he's all the more popular for it.")
('Van', 'Right now, this place is the main attraction of the<br/>Eastern Quarter.')
('Caroline', "Fascinating. Well, I'd certainly like to meet that<br/>popular dancer if I get the chance.")
(40301, '*sigh* That red-haired dancer was so dreamy...')
(40302, "For real. I didn't even realize he was a guy until after<br/>the show.")
(40302, "If looks could kill, I'd be sitting in the lap of Aidios<br/>right now. *swoon*...")
(40302, "I REALLY hope he's in the next performance.<br/>I gotta burn his image into my mind before I<br/>head home.")
('Agnès', 'Ah, so those are the kinds of fans he attracts.')
('Feri', "They sure liked Aaron, didn't they.")
('Caroline', '*gulp* Is that the fate that awaits me if I see him<br/>on stage? Will I be lusting for him as well?')
('Van', "Oookay, I think we've seen enough of the<br/>Eastern Theater. Wanna check out the main street?")
('Caroline', "I'd love to!")
('Van', 'This place is the center of commerce for the<br/>Eastern Quarter.')
('Van', "They've got everything from inoffensive tourist shops<br/>to quaint little stalls. The world's your oyster.")
('Feri', "I vote we go to the stalls. I'm famished!")
('Caroline', 'Me, too! In my guide book, it said the food here was<br/>quite delicious.')
('Agnès', 'Well, I think our course is set, then.')
('Van', "Yeah. Let's see what these places have to offer.")
('Jiafei', "Heehee. Hey there. Interested in buyin'<br/>some souvenirs?")
('Jiafei', "Got some mega-cheap medicinal herbs, affordable<br/>fortune vases, and other stuff that's exclusive to<br/>my shop!")
('Jiafei', "We've even got Moshy merch in stock! It's all the<br/>rage with the ladies.")
('Jiafei', "Oh, and don't listen to those morons who say he's a<br/>ripoff of some mascot from Crossbell. They're just<br/>tryin' to drag Moshy's good name!")
('Jiafei', "So how about it, missy? Whaddaya say to buyin' a<br/>Moshy doll?")
('Jiafei', "He's the new mascot of the Eastern Quarter!<br/>This cute little cat thing's gonna be blowin' up<br/>real soon!")
('Caroline', "Hmm. There's something strangely charming about<br/>his listless expression...")
('Caroline', "I'll take twenty!")
('Caroline', "I needed some souvenir gifts anyway. I'll give them to<br/>everyone in my family, my distant relatives, and all of<br/>my son's friends!")
('Feri', "Wow. You've got some deep pockets.")
('Van', "I'd think twice before givin' this scoundrel<br/>any money. He's scammin' you.")
('Caroline', 'What? But he sounds like such a nice man...')
('Jiafei', "That's because I AM a nice man! This is slander!<br/>I'll sue ya for all you're worth if you speak<br/>another word!")
('Jiafei', "Now, back to the subject at hand. If you buy those<br/>dolls, I'll throw in a genuine Eastern bracelet free<br/>of charge!")
('Jiafei', "It's too good a deal to pass up, don't you guys think?")
('Agnès', "That's for Caroline to decide.")
('Caroline', "And I think it's a great deal, so I'll take the set.<br/>Your enthusiasm sold me.")
('Jiafei', "Haha! YES! ...Err, I mean, it's a pleasure doin'<br/>business with you, missy.")
('Van', "I think you just made this guy's day.")
('Caroline', "Oh, wow. I don't recognize any of these titles.")
('Caroline', "The covers are quite unique. I think I'll pick up a few<br/>of them.")
('Fuling', "I suppose it's acceptable for a book novice to make<br/>their purchasing decisions based on the cover.")
('Fuling', "I see you're eyeing 'The Frontier Tribes: A History of<br/>the War for Autonomy.' That's a fascinating read.")
('Fuling', "It's a frighteningly accurate account of one of the<br/>bloodiest wars in the East. It's filled with vivid, gory<br/>descriptions of—")
('Caroline', "I-I think I'll pass on that one.")
('Feri', "Maybe you'd like something that's light and breezy?")
('Agnès', "How about this one? It's called 'The Beauty of<br/>Eastern Handicraft.'")
('Agnès', "There's lots of photos, so even just flipping through it<br/>should be fun.")
('Caroline', "That sounds right up my alley! I'll take it!")
('Fuling', "You're choosing a picture book? Hmph.<br/>How pedestrian.")
('Fuling', "Oh, well. At least you're taking an interest in our<br/>culture, so I won't complain—too much.")
('Van', "(This little girl's got an attitude.)")
('La-Kau', 'Welcome! Nice to see you again, Van.')
('Van', "'Sup, old man. I see you're doing well.")
('La-Kau', "That's because I have a healthy diet.")
('La-Kau', "If you'd all like to be as spry as me, I recommend you<br/>try my food.")
('La-Kau', "I'll even give you a sample for free. Go on! Try some!")
('Agnès', "I...think I'm okay.")
('La-Kau', 'Oh, you brought some paying customers with you?<br/>Wonderful.')
('La-Kau', "How about it, ma'am? I'd be more than happy to give<br/>you a sample!")
('Caroline', 'What sort of food do you serve here?')
('La-Kau', "Great question! Allow me to show you what I've got.")
('La-Kau', "Here's my famous caterpillar skewer! It's fresh off<br/>the grill!")
('Caroline', 'EEEEEK! K-Keep those away from me!')
('Caroline', "After I spotted a caterpillar in my garden, I swore I'd<br/>avoid them for the rest of my life!")
('Caroline', "To think I'd run into them here of all places...<br/>And what's even stranger is that...they actually<br/>smell good.")
('Feri', "Don't fall for it, ma'am! They'll give you food<br/>poisoning for sure!")
('Van', "I kinda doubt that. I've actually heard they taste<br/>pretty good.")
('Agnès', "I'll believe it when I taste them—and, with all due<br/>respect, I don't think I'll be trying those<br/>anytime soon.")
('Van', "Okay, we've done the rounds.")
('Caroline', 'I got so much shopping done!')
('Feri', "I'm still surprised you tried the caterpillar skewers in<br/>the end.")
('Caroline', "Me, too. I guess I just figured I'd take a chance.")
('Caroline', "It didn't taste as bad as I expected, but...well, let's just<br/>say I won't be coming back for seconds anytime soon.")
('Caroline', "Urgh... I can't believe I just ate caterpillars. I want to<br/>throw up...")
('Agnès', 'Maaaybe it would help to take your mind off that.<br/>Where would you like to go next?')
('Caroline', 'Oh, yeah. I remembered something as we were going<br/>from stall to stall.')
('Caroline', 'A long time ago, I read a novel about a gangster here<br/>in Langport. The majority of the story took place in<br/>a bar.')
('Caroline', 'The book featured thrilling gambling matches. It was<br/>quite the page turner!')
('Agnès', 'That sounds interesting! What was it called?')
('Caroline', "I...don't recall, sadly. None of the titles at the book<br/>store jumped out at me, so I think it might be out<br/>of print.")
('Agnès', "That's a shame. Well, if I ever stumble upon it, I'll be<br/>sure to give it a read.")
('Caroline', 'Please do! I highly recommend it.')
('Caroline', "If the pub is here in the Eastern Quarter, I'd very<br/>much like to visit it.")
('Caroline', "I've never gambled before, but I wouldn't mind trying<br/>my hand at it.")
('Van', "Well, there's one pub here where gamblers of all<br/>types gather.")
('Van', 'And we just went there a little while ago.')
('Feri', "Oh, you mean the bar that Jack's at? Yeah, that might<br/>be the one!")
('Caroline', 'Whoa!')
('Caroline', "It's more lively in here than I anticipated. The novel<br/>described it as being run down.")
('Van', "Well, we still don't know if this is the pub that<br/>appears in the book.")
('Halle', 'Heya, Van!')
('Halle', "And who's this fancy lady you've got with you?")
('Feri', 'Oh, great timing!')
('Van', 'This woman asked us to bring her here.')
('Van', 'Apparently one of her favorite novels takes place at a<br/>bar in the Eastern Quarter.')
('Van', 'So she wanted to check the place out.')
('Halle', 'A novel?')
('Caroline', 'This may be a silly question...')
('Caroline', '...but are people allowed to gamble here?')
('Caroline', "I normally don't partake in those kinds of activities,<br/>but I'd really like to give it a try!")
('Halle', "Well, you've come to the right place. A lot of people<br/>here are gambling aficionados.")
('Halle', "Since you're a beginner, though, you'll only be able to<br/>do low-stakes games. Is that okay?")
('Caroline', "Yes, of course! If anything, I'd prefer that.")
('Halle', "Then I'll get the cards ready.")
('Halle', "Hey, Van. You're joining us.")
('Van', "Wha...? Hey, don't I get a say in this?")
('Agnès', "I'll be cheering you on!")
('Feri', 'Show us what you got!')
('Jack', 'Ugh. Why am I getting dragged into this?')
('Halle', "Quit whining. It's not like you were doing anything<br/>in particular.")
('Van', "I'll let y'all pick the game.")
('Caroline', 'What do you all normally play?')
('Jack', 'Poker, blackjack, and baccarat.')
('Jack', "Wanna give 'em all a go?")
('Caroline', "I'm fine with that!")
('Halle', "Okay, then. For these games, we'll do 10 mira<br/>per chip.")
('Van', "Get ready. I'm about to crush you guys.")
('Jack', "Hah. Hopefully this'll wake me up a little.")
('System', 'And so, everyone played a variety of card games and<br/>gambled their hearts out.')
('System', 'Since Jack and Halle went easy on Caroline, she had<br/>a good time.')
('Caroline', 'Phew. Thank you both for indulging my request.')
('Caroline', 'I had so much fun! I better be careful, or I may<br/>develop a gambling addiction.')
('Caroline', 'I felt like I was plopped right in the thick of<br/>that novel.')
('Halle', "I'm glad to hear it.")
('Jack', "We'd love to have you back anytime—except at night.<br/>Things can get a little rowdy around then.")
('Van', 'All righty. There any other places you wanna go?')
('Caroline', "Hmm... I think I've seen everything I wanted to.")
('Caroline', "Oh, wait! There's one more place I'd like to visit.")
('Feri', "Got'cha. Where do you wanna go?")
('Caroline', 'I made an acupuncture reservation at a place here in<br/>the Eastern Quarter.')
('Caroline', 'Evidently, the treatment can improve blood flow.')
('Agnès', 'Oh, really?')
('Van', "The only place 'round here that does those kinda<br/>treatments is Longkai Clinic.")
('Caroline', "Yes, that's where I made the reservation.")
('Van', "It's not far from here. I'll show you where it is.")
('Feri', 'Okay. Lead the way, Van!')
('Caroline', 'This is Longkai Clinic?')
('Agnès', 'Yes, it is. Are you ready to get your<br/>acupuncture treatment?')
('Caroline', "Yes and no. I'll admit, I don't like the idea of having<br/>multiple needles stuck into my body.")
('Caroline', "However, I dislike my stiff shoulders and back pain<br/>even more, so I'll endure it!")
('Van', "This is pretty hardcore for a tourism activity. I respect<br/>you for tryin' it out.")
('Feri', 'I kinda want to give it a go, too. It might be a great<br/>way to recover stamina on the battlefield!')
('Agnès', "I...don't think that would be very practical, Feri.")
('Caroline', 'Now, then. I believe this marks the end of my<br/>sightseeing journey.')
('Caroline', 'Thank you so much for showing me around!')
('Van', 'No prob. I hope you enjoy the rest of your trip.')
('Van', 'Whew... Never took on a request like that before, but<br/>I think we did a pretty good job.')
('Agnès', 'Umm, Van? I should thank you as well.')
('Agnès', 'You accepted her request in part so that Feri and I<br/>could relax and enjoy some sightseeing, too, right?')
('Feri', 'Wait, really?!')
('Feri', "Well, I guess I did have a ton of fun, and it didn't feel<br/>like work at all. Thanks, Van! You're such a nice boss!")
('Van', "Argh... I only took the gig 'cause it'd make us mira!<br/>Don't get the wrong idea!")
('Van', "All right, I'm gonna work you twice as hard now.<br/>Back to intel gathering!")
('Agnès', 'Heehee. Yes, sir!')
('Feri', "Okie dokie. Now that I'm all rested up, I'm ready to<br/>get back in the field!")
('System', 'Quest In a Foreign Land completed!')
('System', 'Received')
('Poisson', 'Back on the clock, eh? You certainly are a<br/>hard worker.')
('Van', "Yeah, well, this request came from Jack, and I don't<br/>mind hustlin' for him.")
('Poisson', "I respect that. If you'd like, I can help you along, since<br/>I know a little of the cheating duo.")
('Poisson', 'I believe their names were Samson and Richie.')
('Poisson', "I hadn't seen them around these parts before last<br/>week, but they certainly made an impression.")
('Poisson', 'As soon as they walked through my doors, they<br/>challenged Halle to a round of gambling. It was a<br/>close match, but she lost.')
('Van', "They beat Halle? Wow. Those guys must've<br/>been pros.")
('Poisson', "I'm not so sure. Had Halle been serious from the<br/>start, things would've ended very differently.")
('Poisson', 'However, those swindlers pretended to be rookies<br/>when they approached her.')
('Poisson', 'A loss is a loss, though. Halle blames herself for<br/>underestimating their abilities.')
('Van', 'So they pulled one over on her, huh?')
('Van', "Didn't the same thing happen to one of Jack's<br/>old buddies?")
('Poisson', "Oh, you heard about that, did you? You're<br/>well researched.")
('Poisson', 'The person in question is very much ashamed<br/>about that.')
('Poisson', "And so is Halle, for that matter. She's really beating<br/>herself up over this.")
('Van', "I get why. Her pride's been wounded.")
('Poisson', 'Anyhow, Samson and Richie showed their true colors<br/>after the match.')
('Poisson', "As I recall, the two of them ran around yelling, 'We<br/>kicked Halle's ass!' and 'I bet Jack's too scared to take<br/>us on!'")
('Poisson', "I heard they've been repeating that ad nauseam in the<br/>other gambling joints around Langport.")
('Poisson', "That's about all I know on my end.")
('Poisson', "I don't have anything on A, sorry to say.")
('Van', "Don't be sorry. You've already been a huge help. I can<br/>get the rest of what I need on my own.")
('Van', "Jack and Halle's reputations are on the line, so I'll get<br/>this settled on the double.")
('Poisson', 'I appreciate that.')
('Poisson', 'Best of luck, Van.')
('Van', 'Thanks.')
('Van', "(I need to find the people who are in the know about<br/>Langport's underground scene and question 'em.)")
('Van', "(Guess I can check out Doctor Longkai's place first<br/>since it's nearby.)")
('Eastern Medicine Dr. Longkai', 'You wish to know about Samson and Richie?')
('Eastern Medicine Dr. Longkai', "I've been hearing those names a lot as of late.")
('Eastern Medicine Dr. Longkai', "Didn't you have a match with them recently,<br/>Shenli?")
('Assistant Shenli', 'Yeah. I dabble in gambling every now and then.')
('Assistant Shenli', "They challenged me to a match, and I couldn't very<br/>well say no.")
('Van', "Got'cha. How'd it go?")
('Assistant Shenli', 'Not great.')
('Assistant Shenli', "I heard about their match against Halle beforehand.<br/>I thought they must've used some underhanded<br/>methods to beat her.")
('Assistant Shenli', 'But I was wrong. They were the real deal.')
('Assistant Shenli', 'As far as I could tell, they were both just as good<br/>as Halle.')
('Eastern Medicine Dr. Longkai', "That's impressive.")
('Van', 'Well, there goes my plan to take them on by myself.')
('Assistant Shenli', "Yeah. Chances are, you'd get demolished.")
('Assistant Shenli', "And if you think you can get rough with them,<br/>forget it. They've always got bodyguards with them.")
('Assistant Shenli', "If you're going to take them on, you'll need a plan.")
('Eastern Medicine Dr. Longkai', "And a damn good one, too. Don't do anything<br/>stupid, Arkride.")
('Van', 'I know, I know. Thanks, you two.')
('Van', "(Okay, I think I'll talk to Jigen next. He's another<br/>acquaintance who likes gambling.)")
('Van', "(Maybe he'll know something about all this.)")
('Antique Seller Jigen', 'Samson and Richie?')
('Antique Seller Jigen', "Yeah, I remember 'em. They challenged me to a few<br/>rounds of cards.")
('Antique Seller Jigen', "It didn't go so well for me. Those bastards made out<br/>like a bandit.")
('Van', 'Sorry to hear.')
('Van', 'You knew those guys were cheaters, right?')
('Van', "Why'd you take the bait?")
('Antique Seller Jigen', "I enjoy playin' with a handicap. Livin' on the edge is<br/>the best way to live.")
('Antique Seller Jigen', 'Sadly, I missed my chance to back out, and I paid the<br/>price for it.')
('Antique Seller Jigen', "Now I'm stuck drinkin' cheap booze for the next<br/>half year.")
('Antique Seller Jigen', "...You better not go blabbin' to my wife about any of<br/>this, you hear me?")
('Van', "Don't worry. I ain't a snitch.")
('Van', "Wish we could mop up these assholes, though.<br/>They're rakin' in the cash at everyone's expense.")
('Van', 'Any idea who else got scammed by the<br/>double-dealing duo?')
('Antique Seller Jigen', "I heard one of Aaron's buds got done in pretty bad.")
('Antique Seller Jigen', "Dunno the kid's name, but he apparently got burned<br/>big time.")
('Antique Seller Jigen', "Word on the street is he's hatchin' a revenge scheme.")
('Van', 'Good to know.')
('Van', 'Thanks, man. I owe you one.')
('Antique Seller Jigen', "Heh. Buy me some grade-A booze, and we'll call<br/>it even.")
('Van', '(So, a friend of that brat is a victim in all this, too.)')
('Van', '(They might have some info on the cheaters.)')
('Van', "(I know we got off on the wrong foot, but if we're<br/>talkin' payback, maybe he'd be willing to help.)")
('Aaron', 'Look at you, working your ass off. Think I could<br/>tag along?')
('Van', 'Speak of the devil.')
('Aaron', "I got a feeling you're sticking your nose where it<br/>doesn't belong.")
('Aaron', "This is usually the point where I'd tell you to hightail<br/>it outta my town...")
('Aaron', "...but after what happened at the docks, I'll admit<br/>you've piqued my curiosity.")
('Aaron', "I wanna learn more about how you do things, so I'll<br/>be keeping you company for a while.")
('Aaron', "And just so we're clear, I'm not taking no for<br/>an answer.")
('Van', "So that's how you wanna play it, huh?")
('Van', '(Actually, this works out perfectly for me.)')
('Van', 'Fine, but on one condition: I want to question one of<br/>your pals.')
('System', 'Van told Aaron about the cheaters.')
('Aaron', "You're chasing those assclowns?")
('Aaron', "Then that's all the more reason for me to join up<br/>with you.")
('Aaron', "Thanks to them, Syd's broke as hell.")
('Aaron', "No one—and I mean no one—messes with my bros,<br/>so I'm SO down to get some payback! Let's go!")
('Van', "Hold your horses, my dude. We're not rushing<br/>into this.")
('Van', "I'm still sniffin' for information on those guys.")
('Van', "You know anything about 'em?")
('Aaron', "I've got nothing.")
('Aaron', 'But Syd might know a thing or two.')
('Aaron', "He's probably hanging around the front of the<br/>Eastern Theater. Let's go talk with him.")
('Van', 'Hey, hey! Slow down a little, will ya?!')
('Syd', 'You wanna know about Samson and Richie?')
('Syd', 'Those guys are a couple of shithead cheaters. I lost to<br/>them big time.')
('Syd', "But that's how the ball bounces, I guess.<br/>Cheating's only cheating if you get caught in the act.")
('Syd', "It's on me for losin'...but there's something they did<br/>that got me pretty upset.")
('Van', "What'd they do?")
('Aaron', "Did they do you dirty? Tell me. I'll avenge you if<br/>they did.")
('Syd', '...Thanks, Aaron.')
('Syd', "I'm not mad about anything they did in the match—<br/>I'm upset that they broke a promise they made.")
('Syd', "Before the match, they said that if I went broke and<br/>couldn't cover my losses, they'd only make me pay<br/>what I had on me.")
('Syd', "Then, after I lost, they did a heel turn and said I had<br/>to give 'em everything I had and then some.")
('Syd', "They told me if I couldn't fork over the cash, they'd<br/>put me to work at the Messeldam Trading Company.")
('Aaron', 'What?! Are you freaking kidding me?!')
('Van', "So that's where Almata comes into the picture.")
('Syd', 'After that, I called up Sei and Huang and borrowed<br/>the mira I needed from them.')
('Syd', 'They came in clutch for me.')
('Syd', "If I wasn't broke out of my ass, I'd bet money that<br/>there're others who got suckered by those<br/>sniveling bastards.")
('Aaron', "I'm gonna murder those assholes...")
('Aaron', "Any idea where they're holed up?")
('Syd', "I think they said they were stayin' at the<br/>Kowloon Hotel.")
('Syd', 'They told me to head there if I wanted some revenge.')
('Aaron', "Oh, I'll be getting some revenge all right—but instead<br/>of dealing out cards, we'll be dealing out ass kickings.")
('Van', 'Yeah, not happening.')
('Van', "You're supposed to be watchin' me do my thing.")
('Van', "So quit tryin' to call the shots. That's my job.")
('Aaron', 'Fine, fine.')
('Aaron', "You better hurry the hell up, though. If you start<br/>taking your sweet-ass time, I'm bailing. Got it?")
('Van', 'Sure. Do whatever you want, bud.')
('Van', "Anyway, we still don't know enough about these guys.")
('Van', "I'm gonna head to New Town to do some snoopin'<br/>around. You coming with?")
('Aaron', 'Sure, whatever.')
('Van', "Hey. I've got some news on the investigation.")
('Aaron', 'Been a while, you two. Sorry to interrupt.')
('Halle', "Whoa. Didn't expect to see both of you together<br/>like this.")
('Jack', 'An unusual combo, to be sure.')
('Aaron', 'Pour me a glass, Halle.')
('Halle', "Sure thing. I'll be happy to serve you one on the<br/>house if you can get this cheater business sorted out.")
('Jack', "Don't expect any alcohol, though. Now sit your asses<br/>down and tell me what you've learned.")
('Jack', "Got'cha. I think we've finally got a good handle on<br/>the situation.")
('Halle', "It's pretty much exactly as we imagined.")
('Aaron', "Those who can't pay up are forced to do grunt work<br/>for Almata...")
('Aaron', 'These guys are the scum of the earth.')
('Van', "We can't let them get away with this.")
('Van', 'So what do you think about my plan?')
('Jack', "It's not a bad one.")
('Jack', 'If you join up with me while Aaron pairs up with<br/>Halle, they might accept our challenge.')
('Aaron', "They'd piss themselves if they had to face both you<br/>and Halle...")
('Aaron', '...but we might get them to bite if you two are<br/>teaming up with a couple of fresh faces.')
('Van', "Remember, the two of us still have to pull our<br/>own weight. We can't expect Jack and Halle to carry<br/>our asses.")
('Halle', "You'll be fiiiiiine. I know full well you're no amateurs,<br/>so I'm confident you'll do great out there.")
('Halle', "I think this is a solid plan. Don't you think so,<br/>too, Jack?")
('Jack', 'Yeah, of course.')
('Jack', "But before we go chargin' in, I want you guys to<br/>memorize some signs.")
('Van', "So we're cheating the cheaters, huh?")
('Aaron', "I don't mind fighting fire with fire.")
('Aaron', "Does that mean we're cool with passing cards to each<br/>other under the table?")
('Halle', "Let's not go overboard... Then again, I'm sure our<br/>opponents will be doing that some, too.")
('Halle', 'Oh, yeah, I should mention that you and I will have a<br/>different set of signs from Jack and Van.')
('Jack', "We don't got much time, so let's get right into it.")
('Jack', 'When I put my right hand over my face, I need you to<br/>discard the king.')
('Jack', "You'll do that when we're changing cards.")
('Jack', "If I rest my chin on both hands, that's your cue to<br/>discard the queen.")
('Jack', 'And if I scratch my head, I want you to<br/>discard the jack.')
('Jack', "Those are the three signs I'll use when I'm aiming for<br/>four of a kind.")
('Jack', "So I'll be counting on you to get those cards in<br/>my hand.")
('Jack', "However, if you're one card away from a<br/>straight flush...")
('Jack', "...then toss out any cards you don't need.")
('Jack', "When you do that, I'll be sure to get you the card<br/>that'll lead us to victory.")
('Van', 'Got it.')
('Jack', 'All right, one more thing.')
('Jack', 'If I cough, I want you to drop out of the match.')
('Jack', "I'll only use this sign if I think our opponents have a<br/>better hand than us.")
('Van', 'Always good to know when to quit.')
('Jack', "And that's about it. Got it memorized?")
('Jack', "Okay. I'll go over it again.")
('Van', "Yep, I've committed it all to memory.")
('Aaron', 'Same for me.')
('Halle', "Sounds like we're all ready.")
('Jack', "Then all that's left is to call them up.")
('Jack', "But remember, we'll have to head straight there once<br/>we do.")
('Jack', "Lemme know when you're ready to go.")
('Jack', 'All done with your nighttime stroll?')
('Halle', "Then what are we waiting for? Let's challenge<br/>Samson and Richie!")
('System', 'Challenging the cheating duo to a match will cause<br/>the main story to advance.')
('System', 'When this happens, you will no longer be able to<br/>explore Langport at night.')
('Jack', 'All righty, then. Time to bring the fight to them.')
('Jack', "I'll contact them now.")
('System', 'Jack got in touch with Samson and Richie at the<br/>Kowloon Hotel and challenged them to a match.')
('System', 'The duo were more than happy to accept—on one<br/>condition:')
('System', 'They wanted to determine where the match would<br/>be held.')
('System', 'Van, Aaron, Jack, and Halle all agreed, and thus they<br/>made their way to their suite in the Kowloon Hotel.')
('Ferryman Shou', 'Oh, hey, Aaron!')
('Ferryman Shou', "I'm glad to see you're all right. I was worried when I<br/>heard you disappeared this morning.")
('Ferryman Shou', 'You look calmer than I expected.')
('Ferryman Shou', 'Oh, hey, Aaron! You with the fixer today?')
('Ferryman Shou', "I'm glad to see you're all right. I was worried when I<br/>heard you disappeared this morning.")
('Ferryman Shou', 'You look calmer than I expected.')
('Aaron', 'Oh, really? Huh. Guess I am calm.')
('Aaron', 'By the way, we gotta head over to Heilong<br/>Cheng Zhai.')
('Aaron', 'Could you lend us a boat?')
('Ferryman Shou', "You're going there?")
('Ferryman Shou', "Well, you know I'd never turn down a request from<br/>you—and I won't ask what business you have there.")
('Aaron', "Thanks. You're a real one, Shou.")
('Ferryman Shou', 'I do have a question for the fixer, though. Did you see<br/>my request?')
('Ferryman Shou', 'So, did you guys see my request?')
('Van', 'Yeah. A strong monster popped up in the Eroded<br/>Cave, right?')
('Van', 'Huh? Request?')
('Ferryman Shou', "I'll take that as a no.")
('Ferryman Shou', 'I just got a call from Heiyue. Apparently a strong<br/>monster popped up in the Eroded Cave.')
('Feri', 'Is it different from the giant crab we beat yesterday?')
('Ferryman Shou', "Yeah. The currents changed today, and the tide<br/>has dropped. A new route should've opened up.")
('Ferryman Shou', "And that's where the monster is roaming now.")
('Agnès', "That's concerning...")
('Agnès', "That's definitely concerning...")
('Van', "I'm more worried about that dumbass racer guy.<br/>He mentioned the Eroded Cave earlier, and I really<br/>hope he isn't headed there now.")
('Feri', "Yeah. We can go check it out and search for<br/>those flowers while we're there.")
('Ferryman Shou', 'A bunch of smaller monsters appeared once the big<br/>one made its home there.')
('Ferryman Shou', "We can't do any tours there until those beasts have<br/>been exterminated.")
('Van', 'Got it. Sounds like you need this job done soon, then.')
('Ferryman Shou', "I know I'm asking a great deal of you—and I'm sure<br/>the timing isn't ideal.")
('Ferryman Shou', "So there's no hard feelings if you can't take it on.<br/>Only do it if you have the time.")
('Ferryman Shou', 'Oh, I almost forgot. Not too long ago, a group of<br/>three borrowed one of my boats.')
('Ferryman Shou', "I told them to stay away from the Eroded Cave, but I<br/>don't think they were listening to me.")
('Ferryman Shou', "Could you go check on them? I don't want them to<br/>come to harm...")
('Agnès', 'He must be talking about Maxim and the hostesses!<br/>They must be headed to the island!')
('Van', "Figures. Fine, we'll check on 'em.")
('Aaron', "Though our main destination is still Heilong Cheng<br/>Zhai, so don't get your hopes up, all right.")
('Ferryman Shou', 'Of course.')
('System', 'You can now travel to the Eroded Cave.')
('System', 'The Eroded Cave has been added to the list of<br/>locations selectable from the Travel menu.')
('System', 'You can now travel to Heilong Cheng Zhai.')
('Van', "Looks like there's a boat headed this way.")
('Agnès', "Oh, you're right!")
('Agnès', 'And Maxim and the hostesses are on it!')
('Aaron', "So they're back from the Eroded Cave, huh?")
('Aaron', "Looks like they're doing just fine. Guess they didn't<br/>get attacked.")
('Feri', 'Yeah. Thank goodness.')
('Feri', 'Now we can focus on taking care of the monster.')
('Van', "Right. We don't have much time, so let's hurry and<br/>get this done.")
('Van', 'Time to kick this thing into high gear.')
('Aaron', "So they're back from the Eroded Cave, huh?")
('Feri', "Doesn't look like any of them are hurt. That's good.")
('Feri', "Just because we defeated the big monster doesn't<br/>mean it's completely safe over there.")
('Van', 'Right.')
(40301, '*sigh*...')
(40301, 'The moment we set foot in the Eroded Cave, we got<br/>pounced on by monsters. We must have the worst<br/>luck in the world.')
(40302, 'I just wanted to go on a little adventure with you,<br/>Maxim, but instead, we got chased around by a bunch<br/>of creepy crawlies.')
('Maxim', 'At least I managed to keep you both safe from harm.')
('Maxim', "Too bad our evening plans are in shambles. We may<br/>have a boat, but we've got nowhere to go with it.")
('Maxim', 'Well, what do you ladies want to do now?')
(40301, "Hmm... Let's see...")
(40302, 'Oh, what about that other island! We could go<br/>there, maybe.')
(40301, "Uhh... Isn't that place off limits?")
(40302, 'Oh, is it? Darn. Scratch that, then.')
('Maxim', "Hahaha! Off limits? There's no place in Zemuria<br/>that's off limits to an adventurer.")
('Maxim', 'I say we laugh in the face of danger and head for that<br/>island—full speed ahead!')
(40301, 'What?! A-Are you serious?')
('Maxim', "Of course! We're going to make this an ocean date<br/>to remember.")
('Maxim', "It's time to show off my sick boat-driving skills!<br/>Hope you ladies are watching!")
(40301, "(We're going to be okay, right?)")
(40302, "(I don't know...)")
('Maxim', 'Huh? You girls are awfully quiet back there.<br/>Everything okay?')
(40301, "Oh, uh, yes! We're totally fine!")
(40302, "Wow, you look so cool when you're at the wheel!")
(40301, 'Ocean dates are the greatest!')
('Manager Hairen', 'I must do all I can for them...')
('Manager Hairen', 'Hmm? Ah, welcome.')
('Manager Hairen', 'I recognize you all. You came here with Ashen<br/>yesterday, correct?')
('Manager Hairen', "Sorry, but I'm a little preoccupied at the moment.<br/>Could you come back later?")
('Agnès', "Oh, okay. We're sorry for disturbing you.")
('Manager Hairen', "It might be time to rethink the Eastern Theater's<br/>management policy.")
('Manager Hairen', 'I also want to do something for Aaron. He must be<br/>suffering the most out of everyone...')
('Manager Hairen', 'I may have an idea. Perhaps we could do that for<br/>those boys...')
('Van', "Doesn't sound like he's up for chatting. Let's come<br/>back later.")
('Manager Hairen', 'Hmm? Ah, hello, everyone.')
('Manager Hairen', "Sorry, but I'm a little preoccupied at the moment.<br/>Could you come back later?")
('Manager Hairen', 'A-Aaron?!')
('Manager Hairen', "Thank goodness you're okay. We've all been worried<br/>sick about you.")
('Aaron', "Well, you can quit your worrying. As you can see,<br/>I'm fine.")
('Aaron', 'So, uhh, were things okay here yesterday?')
('Manager Hairen', 'Yes. Everyone was in the theater last night, so the<br/>staff are all unharmed.')
('Aaron', 'Heh. Good to hear.')
('Aaron', 'Why the long face, then?')
('Manager Hairen', "Well, I'm saddened by Sei and Huang's<br/>passing, naturally. I knew them well.")
('Manager Hairen', 'Those two came to watch our performances with<br/>their friends many times. They even helped out here<br/>from time to time.')
('Van', 'Damn...')
('Aaron', 'Yeah, I remember that.')
('Manager Hairen', "And now they're just...gone. They'll never see any of<br/>our shows again...")
('Manager Hairen', "I wanted to honor their memory, so we're adding a<br/>section at the end of our performance tonight.")
('Manager Hairen', 'All of the performers will join in prayer and offer up<br/>flowers toward the sky.')
('Manager Hairen', "We're in the middle of putting things together as<br/>we speak.")
('Aaron', "You're really going out of your way for them...<br/>This all sounds like a good idea to me.")
('Manager Hairen', "Thank you. It's the least we could do for them.")
('Manager Hairen', "Unfortunately, there's one small problem...")
('Manager Hairen', "You see, there's a particular flower I want to use.<br/>It carries a symbolic meaning that's perfect for<br/>the occasion.")
('Manager Hairen', "But I haven't been able to find it at the marketplace.")
('Agnès', 'Have you considered importing it?')
('Manager Hairen', "I thought about it, but I wouldn't have time to do so<br/>before the end of the day. I'd like to do this during<br/>today's performance, if possible.")
('Manager Hairen', 'And I really want to do it with the specific flower I<br/>had in mind.')
('Aaron', "Okay, so what's it called?")
('Manager Hairen', 'The spring lily.')
('Aaron', 'Ah. That one.')
('Van', "First I've heard of it.")
('Aaron', 'The spring lily comes up sometimes in folklore.')
('Aaron', "It's a rare flower that grows deep within the<br/>Eroded Cave.")
('Manager Hairen', 'Its petals are light green, and they glow ever<br/>so slightly.')
('Manager Hairen', 'Their innocent light guides the spirits of the dead to<br/>the Heavenly Mother. Or so the tale goes.')
('Van', "Got'cha. I get why you'd really want to go for it now.")
('Feri', 'Do you guys think we can help him?')
('Aaron', "I dunno. We're kinda in a hurry.")
('Aaron', "If we happen to stumble upon some, though, we'll try<br/>to bring them to you.")
('Manager Hairen', 'Thank you, Aaron. I appreciate it.')
('Van', "You ain't foolin' anyone. We can tell you wanna<br/>do this.")
('Aaron', 'Yo! We got what you asked for.')
('Manager Hairen', 'A-Aaron?!')
('Manager Hairen', "Thank goodness you're okay. We've all been worried<br/>sick about you.")
('Aaron', "Well, you can quit your worrying. As you can see,<br/>I'm fine.")
('Aaron', 'So, uhh, were things okay here yesterday?')
('Manager Hairen', 'Yes. Everyone was in the theater last night, so the<br/>staff are all unharmed.')
('Aaron', 'Heh. Good to hear.')
('Aaron', 'Why the long face, then?')
('Manager Hairen', "Well, I'm saddened by Sei and Huang's<br/>passing, naturally. I knew them well.")
('Manager Hairen', 'Those two came to watch our performances with<br/>their friends many times. They even helped out here<br/>from time to time.')
('Van', 'Damn...')
('Aaron', '...')
('Manager Hairen', "And now they're just...gone. They'll never see any of<br/>our shows again...")
('Manager Hairen', "I wanted to honor their memory, so we're adding a<br/>section at the end of our performance tonight.")
('Manager Hairen', 'All of the performers will join in prayer and offer up<br/>flowers toward the sky.')
('Manager Hairen', "We're in the middle of putting things together as<br/>we speak.")
('Feri', "That's a great idea!")
('Aaron', 'Yeah, sounds good to me, too.')
('Manager Hairen', "Thank you. It's the least we could do for them.")
('Manager Hairen', "Unfortunately, there's one small problem...")
('Manager Hairen', "You see, there's a particular flower I want to use.<br/>It carries a symbolic meaning that's perfect for<br/>the occasion.")
('Manager Hairen', "But I haven't been able to find it at the marketplace.")
('Agnès', 'Have you considered importing it?')
('Manager Hairen', "I thought about it, but I wouldn't have time to do so<br/>before the end of the day. I'd like to do this during<br/>today's performance, if possible.")
('Manager Hairen', 'And I really want to do it with the specific flower I<br/>had in mind.')
('Aaron', "Okay, so what's it called?")
('Manager Hairen', 'The spring lily.')
('Feri', 'Wait, that sounds familiar.')
('Agnès', 'Ah, what a coincidence! We happened to pick some<br/>up earlier.')
('Manager Hairen', 'R-Really?! You have spring lilies with you?!')
('Aaron', "Well, isn't that convenient? Here you go.")
('System', 'Delivered spring lilies to Manager Hairen.')
('Manager Hairen', 'M-My word! These are indeed the genuine article.')
('Manager Hairen', 'Thank you so much, everyone!')
('Manager Hairen', "But I can't just take them for free. Have these.")
('System', 'Obtained 4 <br/>.')
('Van', "Hey, we didn't do this for a reward...but, uh, we'll<br/>take it anyway.")
('Manager Hairen', "I would've loved for you to join us in tonight's<br/>show, Aaron...")
('Manager Hairen', "...but I realize now's not the time for that.")
('Manager Hairen', 'I promise you that we will pour our hearts and souls<br/>into this performance—for Sei and Huang.')
('Aaron', 'Right... Take good care of them, all right?')
('Manager Hairen', 'Of course.')
('Feri', "(I'm happy for Aaron.)")
('Agnès', '(Me, too.)')
('Van', "(Hopefully this'll help take some of the weight off of<br/>his shoulders.)")
('Risette', 'These orange lanterns are gorgeous...')
('Van', "They sure are. Looks like we're in Langport's Eastern<br/>Quarter now.")
('Van', 'When we came here a while back, we had to deal<br/>with Heiyue and Almata...')
('Van', "Still enjoyed seein' this place again, though. Hard not<br/>to get wrapped in all its Eastern charms.")
('Risette', 'I know what you mean. The vermillion lights are<br/>quite beautiful.')
('Risette', 'And the gorgeous night sky is...enchanting.')
('Van', "Not sure if I'd go that far, but yeah, the night view is<br/>pretty damn great.")
('Van', "And so's the ocean view from the harbor—especially<br/>in the evening.")
('Risette', 'Is it now? Then let me extract the evening data.')
('Van', 'Heh. Yet another curveball.')
('Risette', "You weren't exaggerating. The view from here<br/>is breathtaking.")
('Van', "Sorry if it's a little much.")
('Risette', "Oh, it isn't at all! I could watch the gentle swaying of<br/>the waves for hours.")
('Van', "In that case, why don't you come here in<br/>person sometime?")
('Van', "There's a mountain of delicious food, and the Eastern<br/>Theater performances alone are worth the trip.")
('Risette', "That all sounds lovely. I think I'll do that someday.")
('Risette', '...')
('Risette', 'I hate to put an end to this, but we have our test<br/>results now.')
('Risette', "I'll go ahead and end the simulation.")
('System', "Van's pickup truck is parked here.")
('System', "It's an old jukebox.")
('Van', 'I gotta focus on showing her around.')
('System', 'Head to the Eroded Cave?')
('Feri', "Whew. That was a goooood shower. Now I'm all nice<br/>and warm!")
('Agnès', "Let's dry your hair now. Wait... Does this place not<br/>have a dryer?")
('Van', '(I should let them relax. No need to get them<br/>involved in this.)')
