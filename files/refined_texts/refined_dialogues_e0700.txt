('Feri', "There's still no sign of any people or monsters.")
('Aaron', "Well, I don't know about you, but I'm getting bored<br/>of just running, so how about you get to spilling?")
('Aaron', 'Time to tell us about Van, buddy.')
('Agnès', 'A-Aaron...')
('Feri', 'Yeah! I wanna know, too!')
('Kincaid', 'Heh. I can only tell you about the times when we<br/>were together, though.')
('Kincaid', "I believe you've already heard about his time in<br/>Oración...which just leaves our time at Aramis.")
('Agnès', '...!<br/>(I really want to know, but still...)')
('Feri', 'Yes, please!')
('Aaron', 'We wanna hear all the sordid deets between him and<br/>Auclair, too.')
('Agnès', "G-Guys, we really shouldn't...")
('Kincaid', "Hmm... If you'd rather not be involved, we can run a<br/>bit ahead of you.")
('Agnès', 'W-Wai—')
('Agnès', '...')
('Aaron', 'Heh. Yeah, I thought so.')
('Feri', 'Heehee. The more, the merrier!')
('Kincaid', 'All right, then...')
('Van', "*sigh* Why do I get the feelin' René's tellin' 'em<br/>about my personal life as we speak?")
('Quatre', 'Well, he DID say he was going to...')
('Judith', 'And here we are missing out on the fun. So come<br/>on—out with it!')
('Van', 'Out with what?!')
('Quatre', 'We want to hear everything that happened while you<br/>were at Aramis, of course!')
('Judith', "Yeah. It sure feels to me like you were going out with<br/>Beauty's Blade while you were there...")
('Van', 'Urgh...')
('Risette', "It isn't proper to pry into another's affairs, you two.")
('Risette', 'Oh, but what an incredible coincidence it was that<br/>you happened to meet your friends again while at<br/>Aramis, hmm?')
('Van', "You're just as bad as the rest of them!")
('Van', "Though it's not like I'm that desperate to hide it<br/>or anything.")
('Van', "So, you know all about me growin' up in an<br/>orphanage in Oración...")
('Van', '...but after that, I ended up in the custody of<br/>another place.')
('Van', 'A lot happened after that to say the least, both good<br/>and bad.')
('Van', 'Then things changed again when I was fourteen, and<br/>I ended up somewhere else.')
('Van', 'That was when someone suggested I take the<br/>entrance exam for Aramis.')
('Van', 'And that was where we met again for the first time in<br/>seven years.')
('Van', "I had no idea what they'd been up to all that time,<br/>and they knew just as little about me.")
('Van', "There are just some people you can't get away from<br/>though, I guess.")
('Kincaid', 'Still, while neither of us knew exactly what<br/>happened to him...')
('Kincaid', '...we could tell something had.')
('Kincaid', "We didn't try to push the matter. Instead, we rejoiced<br/>in our reunion and rekindled our old bonds.")
('Kincaid', 'Much happened during our time together, including<br/>the school festival in late April and the Student<br/>Council president election...')
('Kincaid', '...and through it all, we quickly went back to being as<br/>close as we were before.')
('Kincaid', 'When I became Student Council president, the two<br/>of them even helped me with my work.')
('Kincaid', 'Still, not everything could be the same as it was in the<br/>old days.')
('Kincaid', "It didn't take long for Van and Elaine to realize their<br/>attraction to one another...")
('Kincaid', '...and, during late autumn, the two of them confessed<br/>to each other and started dating.')
('Kincaid', 'Having suspected how they felt towards one another<br/>since our childhood, the only surprise for me was that<br/>it took so long.')
('Kincaid', "Still, while it made me happy to see the two of them<br/>come together, I couldn't help but feel a little lonely<br/>to see them pair off without me.")
('Kincaid', '...Did I have feelings for her? No, not at all.')
('Kincaid', 'I had a girlfriend of my own at the time, and all in all,<br/>I was quite satisfied with my personal life.')
('Van', 'Still, it was like most relationships at that age. It was<br/>never gonna last—it was over and done in half a year.')
('Van', "I think we'd just gotten carried away 'cause we were<br/>so happy to be together again.")
('Van', "I wasn't the only one with stuff going on, either.<br/>I could tell she had trouble with her family even then.")
('Van', "But that's how relationships are. We probably<br/>could've taken it further—it just didn't work out<br/>that way.")
('Van', 'After that, we were both focused on the school<br/>festival as second years. And by that, I mean we were<br/>busy as hell.')
('Van', "Preparations revolved around René as president,<br/>Elaine as vice president, and me workin' behind<br/>the scenes.")
('Van', 'We filled the whole thing with surprises.<br/>The performance at the end was some real<br/>unprecedented stuff.')
('Van', "The school principal may've been less than pleased by<br/>it all, but lookin' back, it was still a fond memory<br/>for me.")
('Van', "You wouldn't believe how cute Elaine was then, or<br/>how much like an older brother René was with the<br/>way he looked out for us.")
('Van', 'But I...')
('Kincaid', 'But not long after, everything came to an abrupt end.')
('Kincaid', 'The next Student Council election was held in May,<br/>and Elaine became its next president.')
('Kincaid', 'Everyone, including us, expected that Van would go<br/>on to become her vice president...but it was not to be.')
('Kincaid', "All the letter he left to me said was, 'Sorry. Take care<br/>of Elaine for me.'")
('Kincaid', 'While the one he left for Elaine contained a clumsily<br/>written apology.')
('Kincaid', 'Neither of us were told anything about the reason<br/>behind his actions.')
('Van', "And that's how second-year student Van Arkride<br/>dropped out before he could graduate.")
('Van', 'That was seven years ago now—well, seven and a half<br/>if you wanna get nitpicky about it.')
('Quatre', 'Van...')
('Risette', '...')
('Judith', 'Why did you...? No, never mind.')
('Van', "There were a bunch of reasons why I dropped out,<br/>but one was that I just wasn't cut out for that life to<br/>begin with.")
('Van', "Sure, you guys already know I'm not great in groups<br/>or at being a part of somethin'.")
('Van', "Aaron's got a bit of that in him, too, so I'm really<br/>hopin' he doesn't end up like me.")
('Quatre', "...I don't think you need to worry about him.")
('Quatre', "Still, are you sure you're really as bad with groups as<br/>you're saying?")
('Van', '...Huh?')
('Agnès', '...')
('Feri', 'B-But why would he just drop out like that?')
('Aaron', "Sure there's some reason, but no doubt he'd rather<br/>take it to the grave than tell us.")
('Aaron', 'Judging by that crap he was spewing this morning.')
('Feri', 'Oh, right...')
('Agnès', 'Van is going to be just fine.')
('Feri', '...Oh?')
('Aaron', 'Hmm?')
('Agnès', "I believe the reason he said what he did this morning<br/>is the opposite: because he's facing us head on.")
('Agnès', "He's not trying to change the subject or gloss over<br/>how he's feeling—he's giving us a clear sign that<br/>something's wrong.")
('Agnès', "We all know how he is. He's cunning but kind, and<br/>more dependable than anyone...and deep down, a<br/>little timid, too.")
('Agnès', "That's why I'm not worried about him. He's going to<br/>be just fine.")
('Feri', 'Ah...')
('Kincaid', '...')
('Risette', 'You have been doing a fine job as the chief of<br/>Arkride Solutions.')
('Risette', 'It seems to come to you naturally, too, as does your<br/>consideration for all of us.')
('Judith', "Yeah. You've always been good at looking out<br/>for others. I mean, look at how understanding you've<br/>been of my situation.")
('Judith', "I don't think Elaine and Kincaid are going to be<br/>satisfied with that explanation—or the others in the<br/>office, for that matter.")
('Van', '...')
('Risette', 'I believe the time will eventually come for you to stop<br/>running and face everyone.')
('Risette', 'Not just us, but your friends, your master, the people<br/>you live with...')
('Risette', 'There are so many people who care deeply for you.<br/>I count myself among them.')
('Quatre', "It's honestly hard to watch you sometimes and not<br/>say anything.")
('Quatre', 'But at the end of the day, the responsibility falls to<br/>you before anyone else, and you need to be aware<br/>of that.')
('Van', '...Good grief.')
('Van', "I feel like I can hear everyone on René's side sayin'<br/>the same damn things.")
('Van', "I'll settle this with myself eventually. If for nothin'<br/>else but to make me look cool.")
('Judith', 'Haha. That sounds like a good start to me.')
('Quatre', 'You DO like to act cool, after all.')
('Risette', 'We would all like to do what we can to help you<br/>when that time comes.')
('Kincaid', "Heh. Perhaps he's finally losing his touch...")
('Kincaid', "...or more like it's time for him to finally pay<br/>the piper.")
('Aaron', "Damn. He's fighting a losing battle if even a<br/>schoolgirl can see through his act now.")
('Aaron', "Feels like he's putting a pointlessly long abeyance on<br/>the inevitable while he tries to find himself to me, if<br/>I'm being real with you.")
('Feri', "Hmm... I could see the 'finding himself' angle, yeah.")
('Feri', "No idea what an 'abeyance' is, though...")
('Agnès', "Ahaha... I'm not sure it's quite that simple.")
('Agnès', "Still, I believe in him. I know he'll stop averting his<br/>eyes one day.")
('Agnès', 'Not from us so much as from himself.')
('Feri', 'Agnès...')
('Aaron', 'Ha! Listen to this girl.')
('Kincaid', "It's that kind of straightforward honesty that has the<br/>greatest effect on him, I think.")
('Kincaid', "(Perhaps if I'd been able to say the same to him seven<br/>years ago... No. There's no use in dwelling on<br/>the past.)")
('Kincaid', "We're almost at the end of the corridor. Get<br/>ready, team.")
('Kincaid', "Now that we've come this far, I'm determined to<br/>make it to the end before he does.")
('Aaron', "Then let's get a move on!")
('Feri', 'Right!')
('Agnès', "*sigh* This isn't a race, you know...")
('Agnès', "(...Even if I admittedly do want to see everyone's<br/>faces again as soon as possible.)")
