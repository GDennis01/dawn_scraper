('Van', "To make it short, I think it's safe to assume the thing<br/>Giacomo made off with is the orbment you're<br/>lookin' for.")
('Van', 'We know it was stolen from an antique shop a week<br/>ago by a gang of punks.')
('Van', 'Said punks then met with a pair of others to deliver it<br/>and, at this point, likely had some dispute over mira.')
('Van', "That was when the police charged onto the scene,<br/>leavin' Giacomo—who called them—to snatch the<br/>goods using his RAMDA.")
('Van', 'But then that pair tracked him down the very<br/>next day.')
('Van', 'They waited in ambush for him at the crime scene,<br/>murdered him, then stole his RAMDA and used it<br/>to escape.')
('Van', "RAMDAs are like any other kinda computer in that<br/>they've got apps to note things down and store info<br/>in 'em.")
('Van', "Giacomo was always a cautious one, so I'm sure he<br/>wouldn't have made the info too easy to identify...")
('Van', "...but I'm guessin' the locations of his hideouts were<br/>on there, so the culprits could use the device to<br/>find 'em.")
('Agnès', 'Do you think his murderers are using the RAMDA<br/>to find which spot has what he stole, then?')
('Van', "Pretty much. Fortunately, we've been able to use data<br/>on his recent movements to narrow down the top<br/>three places it could be.")
('Van', "One's in front of Trion Tower in the 3rd District,<br/>one's near Central Station in the 7th District...")
('Van', "...and then there's one in the 12th District around the<br/>Grand Circuit racetrack on the outskirts of town.")
('Van', "Which of 'em would you say is the most fishy?")
('Agnès', 'Hmm...')
('Van', "Nah. I think it's safe to rule the tower and the<br/>circuit out.")
('Van', "Until last night, they were both full of people 'cause<br/>of Summer Fest and the Z1 Grand Prix.")
('Agnès', 'Oh, I see. Having more people than usual would raise<br/>the odds of someone seeing him enter his hideout.')
('Van', "Exactly. He wouldn't've wanted that.")
('Van', "Oh, yeah? Why'd you go with that?")
('Agnès', 'Well, Summer Fest was being held in the tower until<br/>late last night.')
('Agnès', 'I believe the Z1 Grand Prix was also being held at the<br/>circuit then.')
('Agnès', "I can't imagine he would want to risk his hideout<br/>being discovered by going inside when there were lots<br/>of people around.")
('Van', 'Heh. Nice work.')
('Van', "There's a door down an alley just before the station<br/>that leads underground.")
('Van', "My guess is Giacomo hid what we're after<br/>down there.")
('Agnès', 'Then that means we should—')
('Van', "Nah. No 'we.' You're gettin' off at the next stop.")
('Agnès', 'What?')
('Van', 'Closest station to your dorms, right?')
('Van', "Don't worry. I'll have this thing cracked by the end of<br/>the day and the goods with you by tomorrow.")
('Agnès', 'B-But you were fine with me helping you before...')
('Van', 'Before. This is now.')
('Van', "The affiliation of Giacomo's murderers<br/>changes everything.")
('Agnès', "Are you referring to that 'A' group?")
('Van', "Yeah. Everyone is on guard about 'em right now.")
('Van', "Not just the cops and the guild, either. I'm talkin'<br/>other organized crime groups and even jaeger corps.")
('Agnès', '...!')
('Van', "If that's who we're up against, I can't promise I can<br/>keep you safe.")
('Van', "So this is what we gotta do. I'm sorry.")
('Agnès', '...')
('System', 'Earned')
('Van', 'I thought I told you to get off at the next stop.')
('Agnès', "You'll have to forgive me for being selfish...")
('Agnès', '...but you have to understand just how much that<br/>memento means to me.')
('Agnès', "It's something that connects me not just to my<br/>great-grandfather, but my mother and<br/>grandmother, too.")
('Agnès', "And that's not the only reason I want to see this<br/>through now.")
('Agnès', "A man is dead. I know you don't like the idea, but...")
('Agnès', '...but I feel like I have to be a part of this.<br/>Whatever may come to happen.')
('Agnès', "I'll do everything I can to ensure my own safety—and<br/>I'll do everything you ask in the field.")
('Agnès', "So please...won't you let me come with you?")
('Van', '...')
('Van', "Fine. You're the client.")
('Van', 'I can see you at least know your way around that staff<br/>and arts.')
('Agnès', '...!')
('Van', "But you're gonna have to do EVERYTHING to<br/>keep yourself safe—and if I give you an order, you<br/>follow it.")
('Van', 'If you fail to do that, I terminate our contract then<br/>and there. We clear?')
('Agnès', 'Absolutely! Thank you!')
