('Tricia', 'Apparently, something happened over by the harbor<br/>earlier today. Why have things been so<br/>dangerous lately?')
('Tricia', 'And here I was thinking I could have some peace for<br/>once in my life...')
('Tricia', 'I heard there was an incident last night in the<br/>Eastern Quarter. People have been talking all about<br/>that weird fog.')
('Tricia', 'I hope my friends over there are okay...')
('Tricia', "Every time I watch Wolves' Requiem, I find new<br/>things to love about it. Director Lam is a master of<br/>his craft.")
('Tricia', 'I only started watching Kowloon Pictures films when<br/>I moved here, but I quickly became an avid fan.')
('Tricia', 'I was drawn in by their unique settings<br/>and atmospheres.')
('Tricia', "Thanks to those movies, I've made friends with<br/>Easterners who have a shared interest in film.")
('Tricia', "It's been a year since I moved to Langport, and life's<br/>been great ever since.")
('Tricia', "I feel like I'm living in all those Eastern-style action<br/>flicks I love so much.")
('Tricia', "It's fun to compare the cultural differences of<br/>Langport and the place I grew up in.")
('Hanjiao', "We're getting the usual afternoon traffic, thankfully.")
('Hanjiao', 'Now that the cops, the Bracer Guild, and Heiyue are<br/>on the move, the people are a bit less anxious.')
('Hanjiao', 'As long as people feel like they can kick back and<br/>enjoy movies again, I can be at ease, too.')
('Hanjiao', 'We could see the fog that covered the Eastern<br/>Quarter from here. It was...unsettling.')
('Hanjiao', 'Evidently, there were murders that happened within<br/>the fog.')
('Hanjiao', "Can't blame people for being cagey this morning.<br/>I wouldn't be in the mood to go to the<br/>theaters, either...")
('Hanjiao', "I hear this year's film festival is going to be held<br/>in Tharbad.")
('Hanjiao', "I wonder who's going to win the award for<br/>best director. Personally, I'm rooting for<br/>Director Lam.")
('Hanjiao', "Although, I AM a big fan of Director Gotti, too, so I<br/>wouldn't mind if he won it.")
('Hanjiao', 'Welcome to Cinema Nouvelle! What movie would<br/>you like to watch?')
('Hanjiao', 'We host films from our local Kowloon Pictures<br/>studio, but we also show movies from other<br/>companies as well, such as Vegas Films.')
('Hanjiao', "People are always lining up to see Director Gotti's<br/>newest feature films.")
('Hanjiao', "Fans of Kowloon's action flicks often flock to Gotti's.<br/>There's some stiff competition in that genre.")
('Suiran', "Things are back to normal around here, so I'm not as<br/>depressed as I was this morning. Glad I didn't call<br/>in sick.")
('Suiran', "Doubt that thought even crossed the pasta guy's<br/>mind, though. He has so much passion for his job—<br/>and I'm just here for my paycheck.")
('Suiran', "Ugh. I'm down in the dumps after what<br/>happened yesterday.")
('Suiran', "Maybe I should take the day off. I'm sure one of the<br/>other part-timers could take over my shift.")
('Suiran', "But the pasta guy's still going strong...")
('Suiran', "*sigh* Never mind I'd feel guilty if I threw in<br/>the towel.")
('Suiran', "Whew. I'm beat. I can't even muster the energy to<br/>close up shop...")
('Suiran', 'Meanwhile, that pasta guy over there is still full of<br/>vim and vigor.')
('Suiran', 'How in the heck is that noodlehead not<br/>drop-dead tired?!')
('Suiran', 'Welcome! Would you like an Eastern snack?<br/>We have delicious mantou!')
('Suiran', "They're freshly cooked, piping hot, and go great with<br/>our lychee juice.")
('Suiran', "They're a Langport specialty. You'll fall head over<br/>heels for them with just one bite!")
('Vittorino', "My pasta is working its wonders! I've had a slew of<br/>Easterners lining up at my stand today!")
('Vittorino', 'Looks like they all want a change of pace.')
('Vittorino', "Now's the time for pasta to shine!")
('Vittorino', "Everyone's fraught with worry over last night's events.<br/>I'm hoping my pasta can cheer people up a little.")
('Vittorino', "When I'm down, a bowl of noodles always perks me<br/>right up. Pasta, buckwheat, and Eastern noodles will<br/>all do the trick.")
('Vittorino', "I just want pasta to make a difference in this city—<br/>and maybe it can do so by bringing smiles back to<br/>people's faces!")
('Vittorino', "There's nothing in the world that rivals this evening<br/>view...except pasta, of course.")
('Vittorino', 'Did you know that pasta pairs excellently with wine?<br/>Perhaps you should consider taking a swig and a slurp<br/>as you relax and enjoy the night sky.')
('Vittorino', "It's quite fortuitous that the shivering breeze is<br/>carrying the scent of olives. Those who are seeking<br/>warmth will no doubt be drawn here!")
('Vittorino', "Some may claim that the greatest noodles in the<br/>world are the Eastern noodles—but to that I<br/>say, 'Nay!'")
('Vittorino', "Because we have pasta—and I'm here to prove that it<br/>stands at the peak of the noodle pyramid!")
('Vittorino', 'Starting up a successful pasta business in this city will<br/>no doubt be an uphill battle, but pasta WILL come<br/>out on top.')
('Vittorino', 'The fall of the Eastern noodle dynasty in Langport is<br/>nigh—and it will come at the noodly hand of pasta!')
('Xue', "I can't believe I threw my pouch instead of the ball...<br/>I guess I'm a little drowsy today after all.")
('Xue', "It's a good thing I have a son who always looks out<br/>for me.")
('Xue', 'When my son and I were heading home last night,<br/>we saw the fog in the Eastern Quarter.')
('Xue', 'I panicked and tried to rush home, but in the middle<br/>of our run, I lost my balance and nearly fell.')
('Xue', 'Thankfully, my son was there to break my fall.<br/>When did he become so dependable?')
('Xue', "He's growing up so fast... I should make more of an<br/>effort to play with him. We need to enjoy the time we<br/>have together.")
('Xue', "I promised my son I'd spend time with him, but I<br/>fell asleep... I feel terrible.")
('Xue', "The park is a peaceful retreat from the noisy hustle<br/>and bustle of the city. Maybe that's why I get so<br/>sleepy every time I come here.")
('Xue', 'Mmm... Whoops...')
('Xue', 'Zzz...')
('Yao', "Hey, hey! Wake up, Mommy! The weather's super<br/>nice today!")
('Xue', 'Mmm... Right, right...')
('Xue', 'Zzz...')
('Yao', '*sigh* Mommy went to sleep again... She promised to<br/>play with me.')
('Yao', "I wonder if there's any fun games I can play<br/>by myself.")
('Xue', "Thank you again for yesterday, Yao. You've grown up<br/>so much.")
('Yao', "You're welcome, Mommy! Thanks for playing<br/>with me!")
('Yao', "I'll let you get some sleep now. You need a nap.")
('Xue', "Huh? Oh, I think I'm okay. I'm wide awake!")
('Yao', 'Are you sure? You threw your pouch instead of<br/>the ball.')
('Yao', 'I think you should hit the hay.')
('Xue', 'What? But my pouch is right here—ack!')
('Xue', 'Maybe I need some rest after all...')
('Yao', "Have a good nap! Oh, and here's your pouch back.")
('Yao', "I don't want Mommy to push herself too hard, so I'm<br/>gonna let her sleep.")
('Yao', "Otherwise, she might conk out while we're<br/>heading home...")
('Yao', 'On the way home last night, Mommy tripped.')
('Yao', 'I was scared, so I held her hand real tight and stopped<br/>her from falling.')
('Yao', "I've gotta look out for Mommy. I don't want her to<br/>get hurt...")
('Yao', "Mommy only just woke up now. She must've been<br/>really sleepy.")
('Yao', "We've got the same bedtime, though...")
('Yao', "I think I'll jump rope for a while.")
('Yao', '...Aww, crud. I left my rope at home. Phooey.')
('Old Man Wang', 'People my age will never forget that horrible incident<br/>all those years ago...')

('Old Man Wang', 'Langport went through some hard times when I was<br/>a young lad. As the city was being put back together,<br/>my companies flourished.')
('Old Man Wang', 'Over the years, I passed all of them on to the<br/>younger generation.')
('Old Man Wang', "Except the sauna. That's still an important business<br/>to me. In fact, I think I'll go check in on it tonight.")
('Old Man Wang', 'Thanks for the help, kiddos.')
('Old Man Wang', "I think it's time for me to rest these weary old bones...")
('Old Man Wang', '...for today. Hohoho.')

('Deliveryman Anthony', "I've got one last delivery to make, and then I can call<br/>it a night.")
('Deliveryman Anthony', 'Speaking of nighttime, Langport feels like a<br/>completely different city when the sun goes down.')
('Deliveryman Anthony', "Don't get me wrong. The city's gorgeous at this time<br/>of day, but it's also scary, especially with Heiyue out<br/>in full force.")
('Deliveryman Anthony', "I've heard all sorts of rumors about them, and if even<br/>half of them are true... *shiver*")

('Touan', 'Hanson and I are of a similar mind. He understands<br/>the gravity of the situation perfectly.')
('Touan', "We're steadily approaching an era of change in the<br/>world of trading.")
('Touan', 'And we have to be on top of it if we are to survive.')
('Touan', "Heiyue hasn't crushed Kowloon's operations, but it<br/>certainly has a stranglehold over them.")
('Touan', "That's why we can't continue to rely on them.<br/>We have to find our own path forward.")

('Touan', 'Apparently the economy in Messeldam is collapsing<br/>due to the mafia.')

('Touan', "I have mixed feelings about that, though. I don't<br/>think our economy and public safety should be so<br/>dependent on a criminal organization.")
('Touan', "I work at a trade company, so I can feel the effects of<br/>their influence. It's a little disquieting to see how<br/>much pull they have here.")

('Hyades', "You can't be serious. We're going drinking? Now?")
('Hyades', '*sigh* I guess we would be driving all night if we<br/>started heading back now...')

('Hyades', "I appreciate the thought, really, but I'd honestly<br/>rather just get myself a new one. His car's been<br/>having tons of issues lately.")

('Owner Kuwano', 'I come from Longlai. My goal was to serve their<br/>dishes to more people, so I decided to open up a<br/>restaurant in a place that tourists flock to.')
('Van', '(Oh, so it was Longlai food. Guess Elaine was right<br/>on the money. No wonder the taste was so familiar.)')
('Van', "If I'm rememberin' right, the lineage over there is<br/>pretty far removed from Heiyue. Must be a pain.")
('Owner Kuwano', "Yes, that has caused me no end of trouble. That's why<br/>I call upon the guild when I'm in a pickle.")
('Owner Kuwano', "Elaine's been a great help on that front. If she weren't<br/>here, Heiyue would've walked all over me.")

('Van', 'So, you and Elaine grew up in the same place, huh?')
('Van', "You should know that'll be a tall order. Some of the<br/>people there've got some serious prejudice against<br/>Eastern culture.")
('Aaron', "It's not just them. World's full of jackasses who turn<br/>their nose up at our culture.")
('Aaron', "Doesn't matter if they've never had an Eastern dish in<br/>their life. They'll shit on whatever you serve just<br/>because they aren't used to it.")
('Sicily', "I know. That's why—when I do open a restaurant—I<br/>want to start them with something simple.")
('Sicily', "The people back home may have some preconceived<br/>biases, but if they get hooked on our food, they'll<br/>grow to love it for sure.")
('Sicily', 'Elaine gave me that piece of advice, among others.')
('Sicily', 'I mainly wait tables here, but the head chef has been<br/>teaching me all kinds of recipes in our downtime.')
('Sicily', "I know the people of my hometown are prejudiced,<br/>but I'm sure our dishes will win them all over.")

('Darren', 'Something happened in the Eastern<br/>Quarter yesterday. Honestly, I was pretty terrified.')
('Darren', 'I could see the fog all the way from here...')
('Darren', "Then I looked over at Katyusha and saw she<br/>was petrified. That's when I knew I needed to<br/>man up.")
('Darren', "It's been a long time since I last comforted her<br/>like that.")
('Darren', "Phew. I'm pooped. We did a heck of a lot of walking<br/>around, so I'm just about ready to hit the sack.")
('Darren', "Katyusha's a lively gal, but being dragged from place<br/>to place can be a little draining.")
('Darren', 'This light dinner ought to perk me up. Then I can go<br/>relax in my hotel room and sleep like a rock.')
('Darren', "We don't usually have Eastern food up north, so I<br/>wasn't sure if this stuff would be to our tastes.")
('Darren', 'But I guess I was worried for nothing. This dish was<br/>seasoned to perfection.')
('Katyusha', "Mmm... This is delicious! It's light and easy to eat,<br/>just like everyone said.")
('Darren', "Yeah, and it's tasty, too. This is high class stuff.")
('Darren', "I'm relieved that you're enjoying it. I was worried this<br/>kinda food wouldn't really be for us.")
('Katyusha', "Same, but hey. Looks can be deceiving. I'd take this<br/>Eastern dish over that cheap junk we had for<br/>breakfast any day of the week.")
('Katyusha', "All right. Once we're done here, I wanna go do<br/>some sightseeing!")
('Katyusha', 'I enjoyed taking in the sights, but the highlight of the<br/>trip was the tail end of last night. Darren was there<br/>for me when I needed him most.')
('Katyusha', "I'm so happy I agreed to go on this trip with him.<br/>Next time, I'd like to see a place that really feels<br/>like Calvard.")
('Katyusha', 'The Revolution Festival is coming up at the end of<br/>the year. Maybe we could go to that?')
('Katyusha', 'I take back everything I said about Darren yesterday.')
('Katyusha', 'He noticed I was really scared last night, so he<br/>grabbed my hand and led me back to the hotel.')
('Katyusha', "Then he comforted me and told me he'd protect me<br/>at all costs.")
('Katyusha', "Darren's a sweet guy and all, but he's about as<br/>energetic as a bear in hibernation.")
('Katyusha', "He's also a bit of a wimp. The poor guy passed out<br/>right in front of me when he saw a dried bat at a<br/>food stall.")
('Katyusha', 'I wanted to eat something from there, but he<br/>practically begged for us to come to this<br/>restaurant again. So, here we are...')

('Receptionist Humin', "If you're looking for Fan, you just missed him. He left<br/>with Ashen a few moments ago.")
('Receptionist Humin', "I don't know where they're headed, unfortunately.<br/>It sounded urgent.")
('Receptionist Humin', "Oh, Fan did ask me to deliver a message to you.<br/>He said, 'Thank you for all your help.'")
('Receptionist Humin', "The Kowloon Group has been holding emergency<br/>meetings in light of last night's events.")
('Receptionist Humin', "We don't want to inconvenience any of our guests, so<br/>we're trying to handle the situation.")
('Receptionist Humin', 'Fan is currently out. You have my apologies.')
('Receptionist Humin', "If you'd like me to relay a message, I'd be happy to<br/>deliver it to him.")

('Kim', "Projects like mine are always so fragile while they're<br/>in their infancy. These constant delays can<br/>prove fatal.")
('Kim', 'At this rate, the nutritional supplement project may<br/>be shelved before it ever gets off the ground...')
('Kim', "During my meeting with Mr. Hongfa, I learned<br/>yesterday's financing issue was postponed, but<br/>they're at least taking our plan into consideration.")
('Kim', 'Speaking of Mr. Hongfa, when I first got in touch<br/>with him, he thought I was Eastern.')
('Kim', 'People make that mistake all the time thanks to<br/>my name.')
('Kim', "But I don't have a drop of Eastern blood in me.")
('Kim', 'I still think this plan can work.')
('Kim', 'We could turn to villages outside of Creil, such as<br/>Armorica in Crossbell.')
('Kim', 'If we outsource the production of the ingredients for<br/>the supplement, domestic farms can make Eastern<br/>herbal medicines uninhibited.')
('Kim', 'I thought the nutritional supplement idea was<br/>a winner.')
('Kim', "Unfortunately, Eastern herbal remedies and<br/>Remiferia's medicines are dominating the market.<br/>Getting this plan approved won't be easy.")
('Kim', "We're looking to develop an all-natural supplement<br/>using Creil Village's high-grade vegetables.")
('Kim', 'But we will need funding from the Kowloon<br/>Financial Bank to pursue the project. So, will you<br/>consider backing it?')
('Hongfa', "Hmm... I suppose there is a novelty to a nutritional<br/>supplement that's made from mineral-rich vegetables.")
('Hongfa', 'Using domestic ingredients would build consumer<br/>trust, and your company could do a tax write-off for<br/>the cost of materials.')
('Hongfa', "However, there's one fatal flaw in your proposal: it<br/>doesn't take the productive capacity of Creil and<br/>other farm towns into account.")
('Kim', "Well...that's true, I suppose. They may have their<br/>hands full making herbal medicine, which is a<br/>valuable commodity.")
('Hongfa', 'Placing the burden of mass production on them will<br/>likely cause the quality of the product to drop.')
('Hongfa', "Your proposal has potential, certainly, but I'm a little<br/>hesitant to agree to fund it.")
('Hongfa', "I can't believe we were hoodwinked by Almata.<br/>They had a dummy company in the Harbor District<br/>all this time.")
('Hongfa', 'Those always spell trouble for non-Kowloon<br/>Group companies. The tenant issues alone are<br/>a headache.')
('Hongfa', 'People in the finance and real estate sectors are going<br/>to be even more wary of Almata from here on.')
('Hongfa', "If they keep pulling stunts like this, it'll start having<br/>an adverse effect on the economy here.")
('Hongfa', 'Due to the chaos in the Eastern Quarter, the<br/>Kowloon Financial Bank has entered into multiple<br/>emergency meetings.')
('Hongfa', 'Maintaining economic stability in Langport is one of<br/>our directives.')
('Hongfa', 'We need to respond promptly to prevent the<br/>economy from going into free fall.')
('Hongfa', "I agree that we can't ignore any opportunities for<br/>advancements in Eastern medicine.")
('Hongfa', 'But the business landscape is constantly evolving.<br/>The Central Eastern and south sea markets have seen<br/>many changes due to the influence of Valis.')
('Hongfa', 'And the same can be said of Ored, which used<br/>to be an import partner for agricultural goods.')
('Hongfa', "We have to be selective when choosing projects to<br/>back, so we'd need to run the numbers and look at the<br/>state of the market before deciding.")
('Hongfa', 'The Kowloon Financial Bank is frequently<br/>approached by startups.')

('Aimin', 'Though now that international relations with the<br/>Empire have stabilized, we can sell imports from<br/>Ordis and overland routes.')
('Aimin', "It seems like the Empire's smaller companies have<br/>been taking an interest in Central Eastern goods.")
('Aimin', "Our department store has been doing what it can to<br/>help mediate the Empire's trade market.")
('Aimin', 'Welcome to the Kowloon Department Store!')
('Aimin', 'Langport is a city of commerce, so our store<br/>specializes in all kinds of rare imports.')

('Wulai', 'Did you hear about what happened at the<br/>Harbor District?')
('Wulai', "I know that there was some kind of fight there, but I<br/>don't know any of the details.")
('Wulai', 'Why have there been so many incidents lately...?')
('Wulai', '*sigh* Last night sounded like it was pretty awful.')
('Wulai', 'What was with that mist, anyway? We never usually<br/>get that at this time of year.')
('Wulai', 'And then we had those murders at the same time...<br/>Can that really be a coincidence?')
('Wulai', 'A customer from earlier told me he came all the way<br/>to Langport just to buy a Red Star automobile.')
('Wulai', "Apparently he got a model that can only be purchased<br/>directly from the dealer. Must've been a big fan.")
('Wulai', "Red Star's just getting more and more popular.<br/>Hopefully I'll be able to work there someday.")
('Wulai', "Welcome. If you've got machine-related questions,<br/>feel free to ask me anything.")
('Wulai', "Langport's mainly known for being a commerce city,<br/>but its machine industry is pretty robust.")

('Liu-Ho', "Oh, and for the record, those scoundrels definitely<br/>weren't using my products.")
('Liu-Ho', "I've had a few concerns about my choice of trade as<br/>of late.")
('Liu-Ho', 'Since our department store is under the Kowloon<br/>umbrella, we get a slew of orders from Heiyue.')

('Receptionist Calvin', "I heard you two butted heads over in the Harbor<br/>District, but it's all water under the bridge now, right?")

('Aaron', 'Speaking of which, I hear she and him went on a nice<br/>dinner date afterwards. Bet she treated you<br/>reaaal good.')
('Van', "...It wasn't a date. And we weren't alone, either.")
('Van', 'Anyway, I heard Elaine came here specifically to deal<br/>with Almata.')
('Van', "Still wondering how she was up to date on the<br/>situation when she's barely had time to investigate.")
('Receptionist Calvin', "That's because we brought her up to speed.")
('Receptionist Calvin', "We've been tracking Almata's movements and had<br/>intel on their leaders, so we forwarded all the<br/>information we had to her Xipha.")
('Aaron', 'Wow. You guys are on top of this shit. How the hell<br/>did you get the lowdown on the leaders?')
('Receptionist Calvin', 'Heheh. We have our sources.')
('Receptionist Calvin', "Contrary to your belief, we're not always one<br/>step behind.")
('Van', "Fair enough. It's good that you can give Elaine a<br/>foundation to work off of.")
('Van', "You guys're pretty damn competent—and you're<br/>more hospitable now than when I first came<br/>to Langport.")
('Receptionist Calvin', "As soon as we contacted HQ about Almata's<br/>movements in Langport, Elaine immediately<br/>requested to be sent here.")
('Receptionist Calvin', "She said she made contact with their boss<br/>once before. Maybe that's part of why she's doggedly<br/>pursuing this.")

('Receptionist Calvin', "You're the fixers from the capital, aren't you?")
('Agnès', 'Oh, you know about us?')
('Receptionist Calvin', "Yeah. Heiyue notified us that you'd be coming<br/>to Langport.")

('Receptionist Calvin', 'The two bracers in this branch should be heading<br/>out soon.')

('Aaron', 'Blah, blah, blah. Okay, good talk—lesson learned and<br/>all that. Gotta bounce!')
('Bracer Xiaoling', "Oh, no, you don't! You are NOT getting out of this<br/>one, Aaron!")
('Bracer Xiaoling', "If you keep getting into these fights, then I'm just<br/>going to have to keep lecturing you.")
('Bracer Xiaoling', "One of these days, you're going to hurt the people<br/>around you if you continue along this path.")
('Bracer Xiaoling', "I mean it when I say I don't want that to happen<br/>to you. So PLEASE just try and think before you<br/>act, okay?")
('Bracer Xiaoling', 'Whew. That was a good workout. Getting some<br/>exercise always helps clear my mind.')
('Bracer Xiaoling', "I'm glad we got to work together on that.")
('Bracer Xiaoling', 'Let me know if you ever need help with one of<br/>your requests.')

('Bracer Xiaoling', "I see you've got some civilians with you...")
('Bracer Xiaoling', "My name's Xiaoling. I'm from the Gekka school.")
('Agnès', "Oh, right. That's the school Aaron's a part of.")
('Van', "And there's a lot of Gekka practitioners in<br/>Heiyue, too.")
('Bracer Xiaoling', 'Yeah. Much to my chagrin.')
('Bracer Xiaoling', "They don't understand the core tenet of the practice,<br/>which is that the essence of Gekka lies not in acts<br/>of violence.")
('Bracer Xiaoling', "That's why I have to set a good example. If a member<br/>of the head family doesn't follow Gekka's founding<br/>principles, who will?")
('Van', "Oh, you're part of the school's head family?")
('Van', "Must be hard to stand your ground on that when<br/>Heiyue's always throwing its weight around.")
('Feri', "I think it's awesome that you're sticking to your guns!<br/>You're amazing!")
('Bracer Xiaoling', 'Y-You really think so? Well, thank you.')
('Bracer Xiaoling', "It's important to keep your feet planted in this city,<br/>especially when things are on edge.")
('Bracer Xiaoling', 'I was born and raised here in Langport. No one wants<br/>to protect this place more than me.')
('Bracer Xiaoling', "I'll admit that—when it comes to martial arts—my<br/>brother has me beat, and I definitely couldn't take on<br/>Heiyue by myself...")
('Bracer Xiaoling', 'But with my dojo mates and my bracer comrades by<br/>my side, nothing can stop me!')
('Bracer Hornet', 'I was just exchanging info with Detective Dart.<br/>We were partners back when I was a cop.')
('Bracer Hornet', "Most of the top brass is terror-stricken by Heiyue, but<br/>there's still some people left on the force who've got<br/>some backbone.")
('Bracer Hornet', "In my opinion, the cops and the bracers need to work<br/>hand in glove. That's the way forward for us.")
('Bracer Hornet', "I've been asking around about those gangsters.")
('Bracer Hornet', "Just doing some plain old information gathering.<br/>It's a good practice for any cop or bracer.")
('Bracer Hornet', "It's how we got our info on Almata's executives.")
('Bracer Hornet', "Well, I say 'we,' but the credit for that belongs to a<br/>friend of mine. I need to remember to thank<br/>him later.")
('Bracer Hornet', "Whether it's investigating in the field or doing our<br/>rounds, Heiyue makes things tough for us.")
('Bracer Hornet', 'The people of the Eastern Quarter trust Heiyue more<br/>than us and the cops, so they defer to them more<br/>often than not.')
('Bracer Hornet', "That's why Xiaoling's such a huge help. The people<br/>there know and respect her.")
('Bracer Hornet', "You're the spriggan from Edith, right? I heard about<br/>you from Calvin.")
('Bracer Hornet', 'I also heard you have a contract with someone<br/>connected to Heiyue. That came as a shock, given<br/>that Zin has spoken so highly of you.')
('Van', "My office is neutral. I'm willin' to take requests from<br/>just about anyone—as long as the work's reasonable<br/>and the pay's good.")
('Bracer Hornet', "Interesting. I suppose that puts you in a unique<br/>position—one that lets you take on work that the<br/>bracers and cops can't.")
('Agnès', 'I have a question—and I apologize if it comes across<br/>as rude. Have the cops and guild fallen behind<br/>Heiyue here in Langport?')
('Bracer Hornet', 'Unfortunately, yes. They always seem to be one step<br/>ahead of us.')
('Bracer Hornet', "The higher ups in the police department are<br/>practically in Heiyue's pocket, so they're limited in<br/>what they can do sometimes.")
('Bracer Hornet', "That's part of why I left the force to become a bracer.<br/>I also just wanted to help the people more directly.")
('Van', 'Must make things awkward when you bump into one<br/>of your old police buds, though.')
('Bracer Hornet', "Sometimes, yes, but I'm sure they understand that<br/>line of work just didn't suit me in the end. Too much<br/>red tape.")
('Bracer Hornet', "But I don't blame anyone for staying. There are some<br/>things you can only do when you're on the other side<br/>of the fence.")
('Bracer Hornet', 'One day, I hope we can join hands with the police.<br/>If we ever become a united front, we could<br/>surpass Heiyue.')
('Feri', 'Yeah. I bet you guys can put aside your differences<br/>and become great friends!')
('Bracer Hornet', 'Do you know the Divine Blade of Wind over<br/>in Crossbell? He was once a police officer as well.')
('Bracer Hornet', "I'm nowhere near his level, but one day, I'd like to<br/>reach the same lofty heights that he did.")
('Bracer Hornet', "It'd be an honor to meet him in person someday.<br/>Maybe he'd be willing to teach me a thing or two.")
('Detective Dart', 'The police and the bracers agreed to work together<br/>on this case.')
('Detective Dart', "I'm glad I get to work alongside Hornet again.<br/>It's just like old times.")
('Detective Dart', "(Hmm... Doesn't seem like they're making<br/>any moves.)")
('Detective Dart', "I'll be leaving fairly soon. I don't think there's going<br/>to be any activity tonight.")
('Detective Dart', "I know the executives are up to something, though.<br/>I just don't know what.")
('Detective Dart', "It's clear they've been in this area for a while, and I<br/>intend to find out why.")
('Detective Dart', "(I've been watching that building for the last few<br/>days, but I haven't seen anyone resembling an<br/>executive come in or out.)")
('Detective Dart', "(My hunch tells me they're still around, though.<br/>Maybe those gangsters are holed up there as well...)")
('Detective Dart', "What's the right move here?")
('Van', "(He's on the right track.)")
('Van', "(I thought Heiyue was running laps around these<br/>guys, but it looks like there's a few grizzled vets who<br/>know the score.)")
('Agnès', '(...?)')
('Detective Dart', "I'd rather be elsewhere, but I think I should keep an<br/>eye on this place for a while longer.")
('Detective Dart', 'I want to be there when they finally make their move.')
('Bracer Hornet', "Heiyue got the jump on us with the on-site<br/>inspection, but we at least managed to catch a<br/>glimpse of the weapons' traces.")
('Bracer Hornet', 'You think the Almata executives are still here?')
('Detective Dart', "Yeah. I can't say for certain, but we should be ready<br/>for anything.")
('Detective Dart', "I checked the roads and the railroad, but there were<br/>no signs that they left the city. My hunch tells me<br/>their hideout isn't far away.")
('Bracer Hornet', "Understood. I'd need to do some more digging to<br/>find out where it is, but I'm sure Elaine will have it<br/>pinpointed before me.")
('Bracer Hornet', "Thanks for that info, by the way. I'm sure she's<br/>putting it to good use.")
('Detective Dart', "Don't mention it. All I did was pass along what I<br/>heard—nothing more.")
(500, 'September 20th, 12:10PM')
('Van', 'Here we are.')
('Feri', "It's so pretty!")
('Agnès', '*sigh* That drive was just as stressful as the one<br/>to Creil.')
('Van', "But hey. We're here, and we're on time.")
('Van', 'First things first—')
('Feri', 'I wonder who it is.')
('Van', 'You gotta be kidding me...')
('Fan', 'This is Mr. Van Arkride, I presume?')
('Fan', "I believe Cao mentioned it already, but I'd like to be<br/>the first to meet you.")
('Fan', 'On behalf of Heiyue, welcome to Langport.')
('Fan', "I'm pleased to make your acquaintance. My name is<br/>Fan Lu.")
('Van', "You're in line to be an elder of Heiyue, and Cao's<br/>family branches off of yours, yeah?")
('Fan', "That's right. I also serve as vice president of Kowloon<br/>Financial Bank.")
('Feri', "What's that?")
('Agnès', "Calvard's second largest bank—and one of the most<br/>prestigious in all of Zemuria.")
('Agnès', 'Thanks to their foreign and immigrant connections,<br/>they are an institution with a great deal of<br/>political power.')
('Feri', 'Wow.')
('Fan', "You're quite the learned young lady.")
('Agnès', 'Thank you, sir.')
('Van', 'Surprised a big shot like you wants to meet small fry<br/>like us.')
('Van', 'Did a little birdie tell you when we arrived?')
('Fan', "Heheh. It's only natural that we of Heiyue would<br/>know what's happening in our own home city.")
('Fan', 'Ubiquitous as we are, it would be strange for someone<br/>to catch us unawares.')
('Fan', 'Though, our size as an organization does come with<br/>its fair share of challenges, mind you.')
('Van', "Cao said somethin' similar.")
('Fan', 'Simply put, when this many people are part of the<br/>same organization, there are bound to be<br/>differences of opinion.')
('Fan', "Don't worry, we didn't call you here to adjudicate<br/>some petty internal squabble.")
('Fan', 'No, our issue at hand is far more...delicate, to say<br/>the least.')
('Fan', 'Likely more so than you realize.')
('Van', "Which is why we're here to sniff things out before<br/>you bring down the hammer.")
('Fan', 'Precisely.')
('Fan', "Cao's endorsement of you carries great weight, but<br/>I'm glad your senses are as keen as he led me<br/>to believe.")
('Fan', "I'm expecting great things from you all.")
('Van', "'Preciate it.")
('Fan', "Anyway, I suppose that is enough pleasantries.<br/>Let's discuss the matter at hand.")
('Van', 'Works for me. You spread that rumor like I asked?')
('Feri', "(What's he talking about?)")
('Agnès', "(Hmm... Maybe they're letting the townsfolk know<br/>we'll be here.)")
('Feri', '(Oh! So they can give us jobs!)')
('Fan', 'Yes, we spread word both in New Town and the<br/>Eastern Quarter.')
('Fan', "I must admit, it's a curious tactic. Your methods are<br/>certainly unique.")
('Van', "Lots of ways to earn a livin', y'know.")
('Fan', "Haha. Well, contingent on your success, we're<br/>prepared to pay you a fine sum.")
('Fan', "As a reminder, the earliest we'll take action is two<br/>days from now when Cao returns from Crossbell.")
('Fan', 'In the interim, go about your business as you see fit.')
('Fan', "But if you learn anything of Almata's plans, please<br/>alert us straight away.")
('Fan', 'I think that about covers what I needed to tell you all.')
('Van', "Got'cha. Oh, yeah, you know anything about that<br/>problem child Cao mentioned?")
('Fan', "I do, but I'll leave that to the foremost expert on<br/>the subject...")
('Ashen', "Sorry I'm late, Bàbà!")
('Fan', "Normally, I'd scold you, but your timing<br/>was impeccable.")
('Fan', 'Say hello to our visitors from Arkride Solutions.')
('Ashen', "Oh, they're here already? Sorry for keeping<br/>you waiting!")
('Ashen', "I've been looking forward to this. Cao doesn't speak<br/>highly of people too often.")
('Ashen', "Hold the phone—he didn't mention there'd be two<br/>cuties and a stud. It's a pleasure to meet you!")
('Agnès', "I-It's nice to meet you, too.")
('Feri', 'What she said...')
('Van', 'Ditto. So, you also from the Lu family?')
('Ashen', "That's right! My name's Ashen.")
('Ashen', "I'm guessing you want to know about everyone's<br/>favorite red-haired menace? Well, you're in luck! He<br/>and I grew up together.")
('Fan', "I'll leave you kids to your fun, I've got another<br/>meeting to get to.")
('Fan', "And by the way, you're all welcome to lodge here for<br/>the duration of your stay.")
('Van', 'Thanks, but no thanks.')
('Van', 'Already booked ourselves a room in the<br/>Eastern Quarter.')
('Fan', "Hmm. You're ever the curiosity, spriggan.")
('Fan', "It's no issue, though. As I said before, you're welcome<br/>to act as you see fit.")
('Fan', 'I look forward to good news, everyone.')
('Feri', 'This side of town is so different than the<br/>Eastern Quarter.')
('Agnès', "There's even a movie theater here.")
('Agnès', 'As I recall, this is all part of a new<br/>development effort.')
('Van', 'Yeah. Back in the day, all that was here was the port<br/>down south.')
('Van', "But after Calvard went democratic and the Orbal<br/>Revolution happened, things started changin'<br/>around here.")
('Feri', "Oh. I guess that's why it's the second biggest city in<br/>the country.")
('Feri', 'I mean, just look at that huge building.')
('Van', "That's the Langport Trade Center. Some people just<br/>call it the Great Spire, though.")
('Van', "Don't think we'll have much to do there for this job.")
('Van', "Anywho, let's check the bulletin board and<br/>get moving.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Hey! It's you guys again!")
('Agnès', "Oh, aren't you that reporter from the Tyrell Times?")
('Feri', 'Is this a friend of yours?')
('Van', "Not exactly—we've just bumped into Little Miss<br/>Tryhard here a few times now.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Enough about that! What are you doing in<br/>Langport, anyway?! Up to no good, I bet!')
('Van', "Business, as usual. You gettin' into trouble again?")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'N-No... I came here to write an article for the<br/>culture column.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "That's done now, but I get the feeling something big<br/>is about to happen here.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "So I'm using some time off to stay and find a scoop!")
('Agnès', "That's some dedication...")
('Agnès', "(I'm surprised she noticed what's going on. I guess<br/>Dingo did mention that she has good luck.)")
('Van', '(Good luck AND a good nose, apparently.)')
('Van', 'Well, have fun with that. Peace.')
('Agnès', '(Umm...)')
('Feri', "(She's following us...)")
('Van', '(Just ignore her.)')
('Feri', "(She's STILL following us.)")
('Agnès', "(She's not even trying to hide it, either...)")
('Van', 'All right. What gives?')
('Van', "If you're huntin' for dirt on Giacomo, I'm fresh out.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "No way. That's yesterday's news.")
('Van', "Care to explain why you're glommin' on to us, then?")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Don't mind if I do!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Here's an analogy: if trouble is monsters, then<br/>you're sepith!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "While you don't necessarily cause trouble yourselves,<br/>you certainly seem to attract it!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "So if I follow you, I'm bound to find my next<br/>big scoop.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Just pretend I'm not here and go about your business<br/>as usual, okay?")
('Van', 'Like hell, we will!')
('Van', "Actually, I'm feelin' generous.")
('Van', "Lemme throw you a bone—there's an important<br/>person in Langport right now.")
('Van', 'Take a gander.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Maxim Lugan?!')
('Feri', "Oh, it's the guy who really likes himself.")
('Agnès', 'Umm... Van, what are you—?')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Wh-What is a superstar like that doing HERE?!')
('Van', "Can't say. I've got client confidentiality to<br/>uphold, y'know.")
('Van', "But I'm sure that it goes without saying that it ain't<br/>normal for a guy like that...")
('Van', "...to be wanderin' around a place like this all by<br/>his lonesome.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Very true...')
('Van', "Unfortunately, we've got too much on our plate to<br/>keep an eye on him.")
('Van', "So if we've gotta give up on our lead, why not pass it<br/>to a friend of Dingo's?")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'I want to write about politics, though... This sounds<br/>like something fit for a tabloid.')
('Van', "You got a sports section, don'tcha? 'Sides, maybe<br/>gettin' a scoop here will get you the transfer you've<br/>been lookin' for.")
('Van', "Plus I bet you'll understand Dingo better if you give<br/>his line of work a try.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', '...!')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "You make a compelling case, spriggan! I'm no expert<br/>on reporting celebrity news...")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "...but I'll pursue this story with journalistic integrity<br/>and respect for the subject's privacy!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Heheh. Just you wait, Dingo! I'll catch up to you<br/>before you know it!")
('Van', "That's the spirit...? Anywho, good luck out there.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Thanks for the lead!')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Today a breakout article, tomorrow the<br/>Fulitzer Prize!')
('Feri', 'What a charming person.')
('Feri', "She can't be much older than me, right?")
('Agnès', "Uhh. She's a reporter, so it's safe to say she's at<br/>least twenty...")
('Agnès', 'More importantly...you did it again...')
('Van', "A little fibbin' won't hurt. Won't get her a story<br/>either, though.")
('Van', "Oh, well. Time's a-wastin'. Let's go check out the<br/>job board.")
('Feri', 'Aye, aye!')
('Agnès', '*sigh*...')
('Feri', 'So this is the building Messeldam Trading<br/>Company owns...')
('Agnès', 'Or more accurately, that Almata owns.')
('Van', "And it's right down the street from one of Heiyue's<br/>hotels, huh.")
('Feri', "That's very brazen of them...")
('Agnès', "Do you think they're purposefully trying to<br/>provoke Heiyue?")
('Van', "That's definitely half of it. The other bein' a show<br/>of confidence.")
('Van', "Doesn't seem like many folks come in and out<br/>of here.")
('Van', 'If I had to wager, they keep a skeleton crew here, and<br/>their main force is holed up elsewhere.')
('Feri', 'Ahh. So this is their FOB? I can see the tactical<br/>advantage in that.')
('Agnès', '(Their what now? Sometimes she can be so hard<br/>to follow...)')
('Van', "Somethin' about this place rubs me the wrong way,<br/>but bustin' in there ain't really an option.")
('Van', "We'll focus on other parts of town for now.")
('Viola', "Oh? Maybe he's got some keen senses on him<br/>after all.")
('Alexandre', 'We were warned that he may pose a threat.<br/>Remain vigilant.')
('Van', '(That about does it. Might be time to go investigate<br/>that stall at the docks.)')
('System', 'Visiting the docks will cause the main story<br/>to advance.')
('System', 'As a result, all unfinished quests and unseen<br/>sub-events will disappear.')
('Feri', 'What a view!')
('Agnès', "With a skyline like this, it's no wonder people call this<br/>the Dazzling City.")
('Van', "Definitely one of this place's best features.")
('Elaine', 'No disagreement here.')
(40301, 'Please enjoy your meal.')
('Van', "Well, ain't you the VIP? Not every day the head chef<br/>comes out to greet a guest themselves.")
('Elaine', 'I suppose.')
('Elaine', "A while back, I helped this restaurant out of<br/>some trouble. They've been treating me like royalty<br/>ever since.")
('Elaine', "It's been surprisingly convenient to come here since<br/>this establishment distances itself from Heiyue.")
('Van', "Damn. I was just jokin', but you really are<br/>Miss Popular.")
('Agnès', 'So not every business in Langport aligns with<br/>Heiyue, then?')
('Elaine', 'Correct. There are many other companies investing<br/>in this city, after all. People often use this restaurant<br/>as neutral ground to discuss business.')
('Elaine', "Interestingly, the Eastern food served here is more<br/>akin to Longlai's cuisine than that of Langport.")
('Agnès', "'Eastern' is a rather broad term, I suppose.")
('Feri', 'So, umm...')
('Van', "Let's shelve the table talk for now.")
('Elaine', "We wouldn't want the food getting cold.")
('Agnès', 'Especially not a meal as lovely as this.')
('Feri', 'Yay! Time to dig in!')
('Feri', '*munch* Mmm!')
('Agnès', "It really is delicious, isn't it?")
('Van', "Wouldn't shock me if the chef here trained under the<br/>best in the biz back in Longlai.")
('Van', "Guess we should be thankin' the famous Beauty's<br/>Blade for the hookup.")
('Elaine', '*sigh* You can stop that anytime, thank you.')
('Elaine', "Besides, I'm sure your client would be more than<br/>happy to prepare any reservation if you only asked.")
('Elaine', "Perhaps a fine meal at the Kowloon Hotel's<br/>restaurant would do?")
('Van', 'On to us already, huh?')
('Elaine', "It doesn't quite sit well with me that you have<br/>connections like this...")
('Elaine', "...but, given the fact they'd never come to us, you are<br/>the right man for the job.")
('Van', "Expectations ain't that high, really.")
('Van', "We're just holdin' down the fort until Cao gets back.")
('Elaine', "I assumed as much. Though, I'm not sure the White<br/>Orchid Dragon will be quite as successful securing the<br/>help he's after.")
('Elaine', "While that person hasn't left it behind entirely, they<br/>seem hesitant to continue the family business.")
('Van', 'Damn. You know her?')
('Elaine', 'I could ask the same of you.')
('Agnès', '(This person they keep mentioning must be very<br/>well connected...)')
('Feri', "Aren't you going to finish your food, Agnès?")
('Agnès', 'O-Of course.')
('Agnès', "I just wanted to say that I'm glad you're here, Elaine.")
('Agnès', 'Not just because you saved us earlier, but for the<br/>peace of Langport in general.')
('Elaine', "I appreciate the thought, but don't set your<br/>expectations too high.")
('Elaine', "The government's tacitly given Heiyue complete<br/>freedom to run this city as they please.")
('Elaine', "I can step in when the guild's code allows, but at the<br/>end of the day, the people of the Eastern Quarter are<br/>loyal to Heiyue.")
('Elaine', 'Our branch here in Langport serves as an implied<br/>deterrent—nothing more.')
('Agnès', 'I see...')
('Van', "Yet Calvard's favorite bracer made her way out<br/>here regardless.")
('Van', "It's about Almata, yeah?")
('Elaine', 'Exactly.')
('Elaine', 'Ordinarily, the guild only intervenes when civilian<br/>well-being is directly threatened.')
('Elaine', 'There are cases where we can act preemptively, but<br/>people know where our line is and how to avoid<br/>crossing it.')
('Feri', "I've heard the warriors of my corps talk about<br/>that before.")
('Elaine', "Conflicted as I am about a girl your age saying that,<br/>I'll put it aside for now.")
('Elaine', 'All was as usual until a few years ago, when a new<br/>organization demonstrated a total disregard for<br/>that line.')
('Elaine', "I'm sure you can guess who by now.")
('Agnès', 'Almata...')
('Elaine', "Until recently, Heiyue was the undisputed leader of<br/>Calvard's criminal underbelly.")
('Elaine', 'Almata was just one of many mid-sized,<br/>non-Eastern mafias.')
('Elaine', 'However, things began to change eight years ago<br/>when their former leader, Enrique, made a<br/>critical mistake.')
('Elaine', "I imagine you've heard all this in far greater detail<br/>from some of your friends, though.")
('Van', "Bits and pieces. It's hearsay, anyway.")
('Elaine', "Almata's underboss at the time took it upon himself<br/>to 'purge' Enrique and seize control of<br/>the organization.")
('Elaine', 'His name is Gerard Dantès.')
('Agnès', '...')
('Feri', "So that's what happened.")
('Van', "Only ever heard his name, but the guy's gotta be<br/>pretty crazy, right?")
('Elaine', "He's certainly proven himself capable.<br/>Almata's standing has skyrocketed in the years since<br/>he took control.")
('Elaine', 'His charisma is enough to bring even the most<br/>hardened criminals into his fold.')
('Elaine', "And for as exceptionally strong as his sword arm is,<br/>it's his relentless devotion to his cause that's<br/>truly terrifying.")
('Van', "Hold up. Have you met this guy or somethin'?")
('Elaine', "I have. He didn't identify himself, and I couldn't<br/>quite see him because of his active camouflage...")
('Elaine', '...but I have no doubts that it was him.')
('Elaine', "If I'd only been able to apprehend him then, I could<br/>have prevented all that Almata's done since.")
('Elaine', 'But I was utterly powerless against him.')
('Elaine', 'Even just thinking of that fight sends a chill down<br/>my spine.')
('Van', 'For real?')
('Elaine', 'I wish I was exaggerating... The guild and the police<br/>have been looking into Almata.')
('Elaine', 'I suspect Heiyue, the CID, and other organizations<br/>are likely doing the same.')
('Elaine', 'However, every attempt to probe Almata with<br/>undercover agents has ended in failure. Many bracers<br/>and police officers have lost their lives.')
('Agnès', 'Oh, dear...')
('Feri', "That's not good.")
('Van', '...')
('Elaine', "What we do know is that Melchior, the member you<br/>met, is not Almata's only executive.")
('Elaine', "It's highly likely some are here in Langport as<br/>we speak.")
('Elaine', 'I know Van can handle himself, and I can very, very<br/>reluctantly accept that you probably can, too, Feri...')
('Elaine', "But you're where I draw the line, Agnès.<br/>'Dangerous' hardly begins to describe the<br/>situation here.")
('Elaine', "Tell me: why is a student at one of the country's most<br/>prestigious schools using her precious free time<br/>working for a fixer?")
('Agnès', 'I-I...')
('Agnès', "I'm sorry. All I can say is that I have my reasons.")
('Agnès', "My whole life, I've been shackled by circumstances<br/>out of my control, and forced to give up on many<br/>things as a result.")
('Agnès', 'However, in meeting Van and Feri, and<br/>working together...')
('Agnès', '...it feels like my eyes have been opened to a whole<br/>new world.')
('Agnès', 'The more I see, the more I begin to understand what<br/>it is I really want out of my life.')
('Agnès', 'As well as the kind of person I aspire to be.')
('Agnès', "While that wasn't my initial reason for working with<br/>Van, it's the main reason I'm still helping him.")
('Elaine', '...')
('Feri', 'Aww...')
('Van', 'Heh.')
('Elaine', "...I'm still not convinced this is in your best interests,<br/>but it's clear I won't be able to talk you out of this.")
('Elaine', "All right. I'll leave you to your work for now.")
('Elaine', 'Please be extremely careful. That goes for you,<br/>too, Feri.')
('Agnès', 'O-Of course.')
('Feri', 'You can count on me!')
('Van', "Make sure you take the scary lady's words to<br/>heart, now.")
('Elaine', 'Would you like to take this outside?')
('Van', 'Please, spare me...')
(40301, 'My apologies for the delay. Here is your sanbuzhan.')
('Van', 'Oh, hell yeah!')
('Agnès', "What a vibrant yellow! I don't think I've ever seen a<br/>custard with quite this shape and color before.")
('Feri', 'Heehee. Look at it wobble around!')
('Agnès', 'What a strange texture!')
('Feri', '...!')
('Elaine', "Mmm. It's the perfect level of sweetness.")
('Van', "A dessert so slick it'll slip and slide against the plate,<br/>your chopsticks, and even the inside of your mouth.")
('Van', 'The unique mouthfeel paired with its gentle and<br/>subtle flavors is sublime—revolutionary even!')
('Van', "In fact, it's a bigger game changer than the<br/>Democratic Revolution!")
('Feri', 'I know, right?')
('Agnès', "I've been meaning to ask...has he always been<br/>like this?")
('Elaine', 'He never did this when we were kids...')
('System', 'After finishing their meal and parting ways with<br/>Elaine, they returned to the Eastern Quarter by bus.')
('Van', "Well, wasn't as smooth as I'd hoped, but what's done<br/>is done.")
('Van', "Say, you know if there're any public baths<br/>around here?")
('Van', "Even better if they've got a sauna.")
('Aaron', "Old man Wang's got one just down the way.")
('Aaron', "Don't tell me you're aching after one little scuffle?")
('Aaron', 'You gotta work on your stamina, man. I can stay up<br/>for three nights straight with energy to spare!')
('Van', 'Spoken like a true teenager.')
('Aaron', 'Heh. Stay jealous.')
('Aaron', 'I know—you should go for a massage instead.')
('Aaron', "Oh, wait, that'd put an old fart like you outta<br/>commission for a few days at least.")
('Van', "Dude. I ain't old!")
('Van', "Sheesh. Don't know if I could put up with you if you<br/>weren't handy in a fight.")
('Van', "So, you're doing theater, and what? Is the plan to just<br/>join up with Heiyue at some point?")
('Aaron', '...')
('Van', 'What? I hit a nerve?')
('Aaron', "Why do you care what I'm doing with my life?")
('Van', 'No reason in particular.')
('Van', 'All I am is an outsider who floats into town from<br/>time to time.')
('Van', "There are some things you can only really tell a<br/>person like me that ain't got a stake in your life.")
('Van', 'Not gonna force you or anything, mind.')
('Aaron', '...Heh.')
('Aaron', 'This place is special to me. I get to mess around with<br/>my friends and go up on the big stage.')
('Aaron', "I've also got a bunch of memories of being with<br/>Mom here.")
('Van', '...')
('Aaron', 'Sure, Heiyue does stuff that ticks me off, but I still go<br/>way back with Ashen and her family.')
('Aaron', "Though, me and Lǎo Yéye aren't really close<br/>these days.")
('Aaron', "Cao's a shady son of a bitch, but it's obvious that he's<br/>sharp as a tack.")
('Aaron', "If smart people like him can move up in Heiyue, it's<br/>not a bad idea for me to join up and see how I do.")
('Aaron', 'I just...')
('Van', '...have doubts sometimes.')
('Van', "You suddenly find yourself wonderin' if you really<br/>belong here. If you have the right to have a life<br/>this nice.")
('Aaron', '...')
('Van', "A little self-doubt growin' up's totally normal—<br/>happens to everyone.")
('Van', "But I get the feeling you're kinda like me.")
('Van', "You love someone or something so much, you have to<br/>let them go. Yet you don't have the heart to tell<br/>'em that.")
('Aaron', 'Damn...')
('Aaron', 'Lay off the romance movies, old man! All that<br/>sentimental crap sounds ridiculous coming out of your<br/>ugly mug.')
('Van', 'Leave my face out of this!')
('Van', 'Anyway, take it from me: you can make a home for<br/>yourself anywhere you want.')
('Van', 'Could be some far off land, or maybe you go on a<br/>long journey to end up right back where you started.')
('Van', 'Point is, you have to decide that yourself.')
('Aaron', "How 'bout that?")
('Aaron', "You and me couldn't be more different, but I get<br/>what you're saying.")
('Aaron', "Sometimes it feels like the world's fading away<br/>around me.")
('Aaron', "Probably just imagining things, or maybe I really<br/>don't get enough sleep...")
('Aaron', "I'll see my bros or Ashen—hell, even the city lights—<br/>and my vision just kinda...hazes over.")
('Aaron', 'It makes me sick.')
('Van', 'Ah.')
('Van', "You really love this place, don'tcha?")
('Van', 'So much that doubting your love for even a second<br/>makes you hate yourself.')
('Aaron', 'Is that so wrong?!')
('Aaron', "You telling me I shouldn't hate Almata for coming in<br/>and trying to mess shit up?!")
('Aaron', 'Or be pissed at Heiyue for letting it all happen?!')
('Aaron', "Screw all of that! I've got to protect this place!")
('Aaron', "I've got to prove to myself that I belong here! That all<br/>my doubts are bullshit.")
('Aaron', 'But if I gotta be the one to do it, you and the guild<br/>are in my way.')
('Aaron', "I already know you're damn tough, and I like the way<br/>you handle your work...")
('Aaron', "...but I've already made up my mind. So you gonna<br/>get the hell out of here or what?")
('Van', 'Heh. I respect the hustle, kid.')
('Van', "But aren'tcha jumpin' the gun a little?")
('Aaron', 'What are you talking about?')
('Van', "I get it—you're a bit leery of us 'cause we're working<br/>for Cao.")
('Van', "Thing is, I'll work for just about anyone if the job's<br/>right and the mira's there.")
('Van', "But as you've seen, when I work, I do things my way.")
('Van', "So don't go lumpin' me in with those<br/>sticks-in-the-mud over at the guild.")
('Aaron', 'Are you saying—?')
('Agnès', 'Van!')
('Feri', "We've been looking all over for you!")
('Van', "The hell are you all doin' here?")
('Aaron', 'Hahaha!')
('Aaron', "Pops got caught goin' for a night on the town, eh?<br/>Sucks being old, don't it?")
('Van', 'Can it, already!')
('Agnès', "Halle and Jack told us everything. We've been<br/>worried sick!")
('Feri', "She's right! Wait, you're with...Aaron?")
('Van', 'Chill. I can explain.')
('Van', 'But first, Elaine, what are you doing here?')
('Elaine', 'I happened to run into them on my nighttime patrol.')
('Elaine', 'Though I must say, you two suddenly seem close.<br/>Was one wild night on the town all it took to smooth<br/>things over?')
('Agnès', 'Huh?')
('Feri', 'Oh, is this an adult thing?')
('Van', 'Course not.')
('Aaron', 'Nah, tell them. It was a hot night in Langport!<br/>We were just getting busy with a real babe.')
('Aaron', "My man here really knows how to pick 'em. ❤")
('Van', 'Come on!')
('Agnès', "Why don't you tell us more about this 'babe'?")
('Feri', "And what does he mean by 'busy'?")
('Elaine', '...Well, Van?')
('Aaron', "That's my cue to exit stage left.")
('Aaron', "Don't forget what I told you earlier, 'kay?")
('Aaron', 'Keep out of my way and—')
('Agnès', 'Huh?')
('Elaine', 'Why is your bag glowing...?')
('Aaron', '(The hell?)')
('Van', 'Shit...')
('Feri', 'Look!')
('Agnès', 'What in the world?')
('Elaine', "A fog's rolled in...")
('Van', "(I've got a bad feelin' about this...)")
('Aaron', "I don't get what's going on, but I'm not gonna wait<br/>around to find out!")
('Agnès', 'Aaron?')
('Elaine', "Wait! It's too dangerous!")
('Van', "Bah! We're going after him!")
('Feri', 'Right!')
('Agnès', "If all were as it seemed, this would be Almata's<br/>home base.")
('Feri', "Yeah, but I don't think anyone's here anymore.")
('Van', "Probably jumped ship early to avoid fightin' Heiyue.")
('Van', 'Still, our troublemaker might be in there right now.')
('Feri', 'Are we going to infiltrate the facility, then?')
('Van', "That's what I'm thinkin'. Keep an eye out for traps,<br/>got it?")
('Feri', 'Of course.')
('Agnès', "(This is DEFINITELY trespassing, but I suppose<br/>now's not really the time to be arguing...)")
('Elaine', "I've already saved you the trouble.")
('Feri', "Oh, it's Elaine.")
('Agnès', 'What are you doing here?')
('Van', "*sigh* When'd you become the breaking and<br/>entering type?")
('Elaine', 'Never. The police supplied us with a warrant.')
('Elaine', "In light of last night's tragedy, the guild can no longer<br/>stand by idly.")
('Elaine', 'I was hoping to find a lead here, but alas...')
('Elaine', "...it's completely empty inside.")
('Agnès', 'Is that so?')
('Feri', 'Do you think they moved to a new base, then?')
('Elaine', "I don't think this place was ever their primary base to<br/>begin with.")
('Elaine', 'Nothing inside suggests that it was ever used as<br/>an office.')
('Elaine', 'Though, there were plenty of thugs that used to hang<br/>around here.')
('Van', 'A literal dummy company, huh?')
('Elaine', 'Indeed. However, the fact that even the thugs have<br/>left must mean something.')
('Elaine', 'They were likely involved with what happened<br/>last night.')
('Van', "For sure. Even if all the pieces ain't clickin' quite yet.")
('Elaine', "I'm of the same mind.")
('Feri', 'What do you mean?')
('Elaine', 'What happened to those boys was no fight... It was<br/>a slaughter.')
('Elaine', 'One look at their bodies told the whole story.')
('Agnès', '...')
('Van', "These aren't average thugs that we're dealing with.<br/>They seem more like the murderin' type.")
('Van', "Whoever tore up those bodies didn't show a lick<br/>of restraint.")
('Van', "Honestly, I don't know if real Almata goons would be<br/>capable of that.")
('Elaine', 'I concur. Those wounds bother me even more than<br/>the mysterious fog that suddenly rolled in.')
('Elaine', 'That said, I fear we may see worse bloodshed yet.')
('Elaine', "I'm going to investigate another potential lead.")
('Elaine', 'If you intend on continuing on this case, please<br/>be careful.')
('Elaine', 'The Messeldam Trading Company might not be our<br/>only enemies here.')
('Van', "Bah. She's got enough to worry about herself.")
('Agnès', "I know she's strong, but will she be okay investigating<br/>like this?")
('Agnès', "Couldn't we work alongside her?")
('Van', "Well, we'll cross that bridge if we come to it.")
('Feri', 'So, should we go look inside for ourselves?')
('Van', "Nah. If she didn't find anything, we won't either.")
('Van', "And she would've mentioned it if she found anything<br/>about Aaron.")
('Agnès', "I just don't understand where he could have run<br/>off to.")
('Agnès', "How is it that even Heiyue doesn't know where he is?")
('Agnès', "Both him and those thugs disappearing at the same<br/>time can't be a coincidence.")
('Agnès', "There's no evidence of them leaving the city, right?")
('Van', "Nope, but that's an important fact.")
('Van', "Heiyue's got eyes all over this city, but there are still<br/>blind spots.")
('Van', "I mean, we're talkin' about a city with a population of<br/>550,000, after all—not to mention the naval base.")
('Feri', "There's no way we can search everywhere top to<br/>bottom by ourselves...")
('Van', "I'm sure that's what Heiyue is doin' right now.")
('Van', "But we ain't Heiyue, so we gotta think outside<br/>the box.")
('Van', '...All right. This should work.')
('Agnès', 'Are you accessing the orbal network?')
('Feri', 'What are you looking at?')
('Van', 'A real estate site.')
('Van', "I'm checkin' to see if anything else went down when<br/>Almata bought this place.")
('Agnès', 'Oh!')
('Feri', '...Real estate?<br/>(Is there fake estate, too?)')
('Van', '...Bingo.')
('Van', 'A huge warehouse at the docks got rented out at<br/>almost the exact same time as this office.')
('Van', "Can't see exactly where or who the client is, but I<br/>ain't complainin'. We've got ourselves a lead.")
('Feri', 'Uhh...')
('Agnès', "So essentially, this 'Messeldam Trading Company' is<br/>a ruse meant to divert attention from the warehouse...")
('Agnès', "...because that is where Almata's anti-Heiyue forces<br/>are stationed.")
('Feri', 'Oh! I see!')
('Van', 'Spot on. Time to hustle, gang.')
('Agnès', "Huh? But we don't know where we're going or who<br/>rented the facility.")
('Agnès', 'Oh, are we going to ask the realtor who brokered<br/>the deal?')
('Van', "Bad idea. If Almata really did rent the place, there's<br/>no way the realtor'll blab.")
('Van', "They'd just end up dead. Hell, for all we know,<br/>they've already been silenced.")
('Agnès', '...')
('Feri', 'Almata is cruel enough to do something like that.')
('Van', "I got a better plan, anyway. We're headed to the one<br/>guy who's got a better nose for this city than me.")
('Van', 'A certain lousy drunk of a gambler with low blood<br/>pressure and a partner who might as well have him by<br/>a leash.')
('Feri', 'Oh!')
('Agnès', "I don't think he'd appreciate that description<br/>of himself...")
('Van', "Who's textin' me?")
('Jack', "I forgot to tell you where the dummy company's at.<br/>I just sent along the info.")
('Jack', "Feel free to scout it out. I wouldn't recommend<br/>charging in guns blazing, though.")
('Van', "(So that's where it is.)")
('Agnès', 'Is something the matter?')
('Van', 'Nah. Jack just gave me the location of the Messeldam<br/>Trading Company.')
('Agnès', "What? We're heading there now?")
('Feri', "Are we going to blow the door down? I'll prepare the<br/>explosives, then!")
('Van', "Don't do that. I'd rather not get arrested for arson.")
('Van', 'I just wanna take a look at the building.')
('Van', "We ain't in any rush, though. The location's on our<br/>map apps, so we can check it out after finishing<br/>some requests.")
('Agnès', "I didn't realize you were here, Ashen.")
('Ashen', "Oh, it's you guys...")
('Ashen', "I'm sorry about earlier. Feels like I sort of pushed<br/>everything onto you.")
('Van', "Don't worry about it. If I felt like you were bein'<br/>unreasonable, I wouldn't've taken the job.")
('Van', "Anyway, I know you guys're probably investigating<br/>this whole thing on the down low.")
('Van', 'Has Heiyue sniffed out any clues?')
('Ashen', "A few, but nothing that would tell us about<br/>Aaron's whereabouts.")
('Van', 'Damn. What about Almata, then?')
('Ashen', "All we know about them is that they haven't made<br/>any moves since last night.")
('Ashen', "We have no idea where they're hiding, unfortunately.")
('Feri', 'Ugh... Where could they be?')
('Van', "Dunno. It's possible they aren't even in<br/>Langport anymore.")
('Feri', 'What? You think?')
('Van', "Might've bailed so they could get outta<br/>Heiyue's reach.")
('Van', "And now that they've stained their hands with civilian<br/>blood, the guild's gonna be out to get 'em, too.")
('Agnès', 'Do you really think Almata would just back down<br/>like that?')
('Van', "Doubtful, but it's not impossible, either.")
('Ashen', "Actually, I do think it's impossible.")
('Ashen', "And I can tell you why, if you'd like.")
('Feri', 'By all means!')
('Ashen', 'There have been no sightings of gangsters since<br/>last night.')
('Ashen', 'We have eyes on every road leading out of Langport.')
('Ashen', 'So if they had escaped, we would know.')
('Ashen', "I can guarantee they're still in Langport.")
('Van', "Hard to picture a bunch of lowlife gangsters evading<br/>Heiyue's surveillance network.")
('Agnès', 'Well, I guess that settles that.')
('Ashen', "Sorry I can't answer your other questions.")
('Van', 'All good. Having confirmation on that alone is huge<br/>for us, so we should be thanking you.')
('Van', 'Keep us in the loop if anything changes.')
('Ashen', "Of course. I'm going to be talking with some other<br/>people about this, so hopefully I'll have more to<br/>share later.")
('Agnès', 'I think this is the park that Neil was talking about.')
('Van', 'Yeah. He was told to put the goods on one of the<br/>benches facing the ocean.')
('Feri', "All right. It's my time to shine!")
('Agnès', "We'll be right here if anything happens.")
('Van', 'Be ready for anything, all right?')
('Feri', 'Understood! Beginning operation!')
('Feri', "We've got eyes on target.")
('Agnès', 'What should we do?')
('Van', "We'll follow at a distance.")
('Van', "You're Caroline, right? We saw your request.")
('Van', "We're from Arkride Solutions.")
('Caroline', "Oh, perfect! I've been waiting for you all! Shall<br/>we depart?")
('Van', "One sec. There's something I'd like to ask you first.")
('Van', 'Why us?')
('Caroline', 'Huh?')
('Agnès', 'I was wondering that, too.')
('Agnès', "We're not locals, so I'm not sure if we would be best<br/>suited to be your tour guides.")
('Feri', 'Yeah. This is my first time in Langport, actually.')
('Caroline', "Oh, I know full well that giving tours isn't your<br/>primary area of expertise.")
('Caroline', 'But when a local guide told me a skilled spriggan was<br/>in town, I just HAD to meet you.')
('Caroline', "It's like you popped right out of a novel!")
('Caroline', "I thought it'd be much more fun to explore the<br/>Eastern Quarter with you all than a regular<br/>tour guide.")
('Van', "Not sure how I feel about you coming to us just 'cause<br/>we sound more 'fun' than the alternatives.")
('Agnès', 'Well, what do you want to do, Van?')
('Van', "Not sure. This ain't the kinda work we usually do.")
('Van', '(Might be a good way to get familiar with the<br/>area, though.)')
('Van', "(The gig sounds simple enough, too, and the girls<br/>may like havin' some downtime.)")
('Caroline', "I'd love to tour the Eastern Quarter with you all.")
('Caroline', 'Would you mind showing me around?')
('Van', "(This ain't the kinda work we usually do.)")
('Van', '(Might be a good way to get familiar with the<br/>area, though.)')
('Van', "(The gig sounds simple enough, too, and the girls<br/>may like havin' some downtime.)")
('Van', 'Ah, crap. I just remembered I needed to<br/>do something.')
('Van', 'Could you wait a little longer?')
('Caroline', "Of course. I'll be here when you're ready.")
('Van', "All right. This is different from the requests we<br/>normally take, but we'll make an exception for you.")
('Caroline', 'Wonderful! Thank you so much! Today is going to be<br/>a lovely day!')
('Feri', "Yes! Now I'll get to tour Langport, too!")
('Agnès', "(I'm surprised. I thought he would turn this request<br/>down for sure.)")
('Agnès', 'Shall we head to the Eastern Quarter, then?')
('Van', "Yeah. Let's bounce.")
('Van', "We'll decide on where to go once we get there.")
('Caroline', "Very well, then. I'll leave the tour plan to you.")
('System', 'Quest In a Foreign Land started!')
('System', 'Caroline is now accompanying the party.')
('Agnès', "Are you our client? You're Mr. Wang, right?")
('Old Man Wang', "Oh, hello there! So you're the spriggan from the<br/>capital, eh?")
('Old Man Wang', "I'm in dire need of a trained martial artist, and I heard<br/>you would fit the bill.")
('Old Man Wang', "Although, you're not quite what I had pictured in<br/>my head.")
('Agnès', "Umm... I'm not a spriggan, actually.")
('Van', "That'd be me. I was a student of the Kunlun school.")
('Old Man Wang', 'Ah, yes. That makes more sense.')
('Feri', "I feel like I've heard of Kunlun before...")
('Feri', 'Well, that explains why Van moves so much like a<br/>martial artist.')
('Agnès', "I knew he must've had some kind of combat training,<br/>but I didn't know what kind.")
('Van', "And that's not the only kinda training I've gotten.")
('Old Man Wang', "In any case, I can tell you've had plenty of real<br/>world experience. Even at this very moment, you<br/>aren't leaving any openings.")
('Old Man Wang', 'You must have seen a great many battles.')
('Feri', 'Whoa. You can tell all that just from a glance?')
('Old Man Wang', 'Heavens no. I made that all up. Hohoho!')
('Van', 'Very funny. So you wanna give me the job details<br/>or what?')
('Old Man Wang', "Of course, of course. I'd like you to do some martial<br/>arts instruction in my stead.")
('Old Man Wang', 'The moves will be simple enough, I promise.<br/>Could you help me out?')
('Old Man Wang', "I'd like you to do some martial arts instruction in<br/>my stead.")
('Old Man Wang', 'The moves will be simple enough, I promise.<br/>Could you help me out?')
('Van', "Won't that mean we gotta do some prep beforehand?")
('Van', "Sorry, but we're up to our ears in work right now.<br/>Mind if I come back when our load's a bit lighter?")
('Old Man Wang', "That's fine by me.")
('Old Man Wang', 'Let me know if you have some time later.')
('Van', "Sure, I'm down.")
('Van', 'So what kind of instruction do you do?')
('Old Man Wang', 'I teach a hybrid style called Tai Shin—which<br/>I created. It combines twenty-four techniques from<br/>the three major schools of Eastern martial arts.')
('Feri', 'What? You created a whole martial arts style?')
('Feri', "That's SO cool!")
('Old Man Wang', "Oh, it's not that impressive. I just picked out a<br/>handful of simple techniques that are easy to learn.")
('Old Man Wang', 'I only made it to teach self-defense to others—and<br/>for exercise.')
('Agnès', "I think that's very admirable of you.")
('Van', "Hold on. Tai Shin's been around forever. I know for a<br/>fact that you didn't make it yourself.")
('Van', "Stealin' credit ain't cool.")
('Old Man Wang', "Hohoho. I suppose I can't pull the wool over a<br/>Kunlun student's eyes!")
('Old Man Wang', 'Those unaccustomed to our ways are so<br/>easily deceived.')
('Agnès', "H-He sure likes his tall tales, doesn't he?")
('Feri', 'Grr... Fool me once, shame on you—fool me twice,<br/>shame on me...')
('Van', 'Okay, back to business. Why do you need someone to<br/>fill in for you?')
('Old Man Wang', 'Well, you see, I sort of threw out my back yesterday.')
('Old Man Wang', 'I can walk around just fine, but doing any kind of<br/>sudden movement is a backbreaking endeavor.')
('Old Man Wang', 'Get it?! Backbreaking! Ahahaha!')
('Van', "Careful not to split your sides over your own 'jokes.'")
('Feri', "I never thought a real martial artist could throw out<br/>their back. Don't you guys train your bodies daily?")
('Old Man Wang', 'Alas, old age comes for us all, young lady. I hurt my<br/>back while on the waves.')
('Feri', 'Huh? What were you doing on the waves?')
('Van', "Are you kiddin' me? You were surfing?")
('Old Man Wang', "Of course. I hear all the youngins are doing it these<br/>days, and I'm always hip and with it.")
('Old Man Wang', 'I was faced with the biggest wave of the year. My very<br/>life was in peril—but my surfer pride was on the line.')
('Old Man Wang', 'Thus I confronted it head on. I was locked in a fierce<br/>war of attrition—a battle of wills and wits between<br/>man and wave!')
('Agnès', 'Uh-huh...')
('Old Man Wang', 'And I emerged triumphant—so to celebrate my<br/>hard-earned victory, I did a 360-degree spin in<br/>the air!')
('Feri', 'You did WHAT?!')
('Old Man Wang', 'In that moment, I saw the light. It felt like everything<br/>came into focus.')
('Old Man Wang', 'Visions of my long life—the peaks, the valleys, and<br/>everything in between—flooded my senses like a<br/>gushing waterfall.')
('Old Man Wang', 'And after that...')
('Agnès', 'Yes...?')
('Old Man Wang', 'I fell into the water and hurt my back.')
('Feri', 'It sounds like your life flashed before your eyes.')
('Van', "You're lucky you got back to the coast in one piece.")
('Old Man Wang', 'Indeed. A boat just so happened to be passing by.')
('Old Man Wang', "And that's why I can't do any instruction today.")
('Agnès', "I'm so sorry that all happened.")
('Van', 'Hope you get better soon, man.')
('Old Man Wang', 'So, will you take my place?')
('Van', "Like I said earlier, I'm down.")
('Van', "I'm not a full-fledged master or anything, but I can<br/>handle some self-defense instructing.")
('Old Man Wang', 'Fantastic.')
('Old Man Wang', 'My lesson plan for today was five forms in total: two<br/>Kunlun forms, two Gekka forms, and one<br/>Taito form.')
('Van', "Oh. Well, I don't know jack about Gekka or Taito, so<br/>I'm not sure I can help you there.")
('Old Man Wang', "Then why don't you enlist the aid of the<br/>Bracer Guild? One of its members here is intimately<br/>familiar with the Gekka style.")
('Old Man Wang', "I'm sure she would be happy to help out.")
('Van', "Then why'd you even bother asking for my help...?<br/>Well, the contract's signed, so no backing out...")
('Old Man Wang', 'Thank you very much.')
('System', 'Quest Substitute Sensei started!')
('Bracer Xiaoling', "Hmm? Oh, you're that spriggan guy, aren't you?")
('Bracer Xiaoling', "I see you've got some civilians with you...")
('Bracer Xiaoling', "My name's Xiaoling. I'm from the Gekka school.")
('Agnès', "Oh, right. That's the school Aaron's a part of.")
('Van', "Yup. Like Ashen said earlier, it's one of the big three<br/>martial arts schools in the East.")
('Van', "And there's a lot of Gekka practitioners in<br/>Heiyue, too.")
('Bracer Xiaoling', 'Yeah. Much to my chagrin.')
('Bracer Xiaoling', "Members of our school are supposed to reject<br/>violence, not embrace it. It's one of the core principles<br/>of Gekka.")
('Bracer Xiaoling', "That's why I have to set a good example. If a member<br/>of the head family indulges in violence, then others<br/>will follow suit.")
('Van', "Oh, you're part of the school's head family?")
('Van', "Must be hard to stand your ground on that when<br/>Heiyue's always throwing its weight around.")
('Feri', "I think it's awesome that you're sticking to your guns!<br/>You're amazing!")
('Bracer Xiaoling', 'Y-You really think so? Well, thank you.')
('Bracer Xiaoling', "It's important to keep your feet planted in this city,<br/>especially when things are on edge.")
('Van', 'By the way, you got a sec?')
('Van', 'Hey, got a sec?')
('Bracer Xiaoling', "Sure, what's up?")
('Van', "We're in the middle of a job right now, and we could<br/>use a hand.")
('Van', 'Gonna teach people some martial arts. Wanna join?')
('Bracer Xiaoling', 'What? Why would I help you with one of<br/>your requests?')
('Agnès', 'Umm...')
('Van', "I mean, you don't have to if you don't want to.")
('Van', "We need someone from the Gekka school, but if<br/>you're not feelin' it, I'll just hit up some<br/>other contacts.")
('Van', 'Peace.')
('Bracer Xiaoling', 'Hey, wait!')
('Bracer Xiaoling', "What do you mean by 'other contacts'?")
('Van', 'Heiyue. Duh.')
('Van', 'Most of them know Gekka skills like the back of<br/>their hands.')
('Van', 'The Gekka name is practically synonymous with<br/>Heiyue these days.')
('Van', "Bet people'll be thrilled to learn from the real pros.")
('Van', "And you don't have to waste any of your precious<br/>time, so everyone's happy.")
('Van', 'All righty. Catch you on the flip side—')
('Bracer Xiaoling', "I'll do it.")
('Feri', 'Huh?')
('Bracer Xiaoling', "I said I'll do it. I'm going to help whether you like it<br/>or not.")
('Agnès', 'Are you sure?')
('Bracer Xiaoling', 'Yes. I know that people associate Gekka with<br/>Heiyue nowadays...')
('Bracer Xiaoling', "...but they don't follow the main school's teachings.")
('Bracer Xiaoling', "I'm a student of the original school, so it's my duty to<br/>spread the true Gekka style across the world.")
('Van', 'Is that right?')
('Van', 'Well, glad to have you on board.')
('Bracer Xiaoling', "Urgh. If I didn't know any better, I'd think you were<br/>leading me by the nose. You really know how to twist<br/>the knife, don't you?")
('Van', "No idea what you're talkin' about.")
('Feri', "Huh? But Van doesn't use knives.")
('Agnès', "That's just a figure of speech.")
('Van', "Okay, let's meet up at the park.")
('Bracer Xiaoling', 'Yeah, yeah. Got it.')
('Van', 'Yo. We brought the Gekka bracer girl like you asked.')
('Bracer Xiaoling', 'So what do you need me to do?')
('Old Man Wang', 'First, you will practice five forms in front of<br/>each other. You will show Van the Gekka forms, and<br/>he will show you the Kunlun forms.')
('Old Man Wang', 'After that, you will both demonstrate them to<br/>my students.')
('Bracer Xiaoling', 'Got it. I can manage that no problem.')
('Van', 'Same here.')
('Old Man Wang', 'Okay, then. These are the names of the forms:')
('Old Man Wang', "Gekka's Twin Crescent Strike and Swallow Stance...")
('Old Man Wang', "...Kunlun's Crushing Fist and Rapid Chop...")
('Old Man Wang', "...and Taito's Elbow Thrust.")
('Van', "Wait, hang on. Neither of us know Taito, so who's<br/>gonna show off that one?")
('Bracer Xiaoling', 'I think I can cover that.')
('Bracer Xiaoling', "I've seen Zin use that technique multiple times.")
('Van', "For real? You're a lifesaver.")
('Agnès', "We'll be cheering you on.")
('Feri', 'Good luck, you two!')
('Old Man Wang', 'All right, then. Shall we begin practice?')
('Bracer Xiaoling', "Yes, let's!")
('Van', "I'm ready as I'll ever be.")
('Old Man Wang', 'Very well, then.')
('Old Man Wang', 'Twin Crescent Strike!')
('Old Man Wang', 'Swallow Stance!')
('Old Man Wang', 'Crushing Fist!')
('Old Man Wang', 'Rapid Chop!')
('Old Man Wang', 'Elbow Thrust!')
('Old Man Wang', "And that's it. Have you committed them to memory?")
('Van', 'Sorry, but can we go over them all again?')
('Old Man Wang', 'Certainly. Practice makes perfect.')
('Van', "Yeah, I've got them all down.")
('Bracer Xiaoling', 'Likewise.')
('Old Man Wang', "Excellent. Then let's put our practice into practice.<br/>Hohoho.")
('System', 'Before long, the park was filled with scores of<br/>students, and the instructional class began in earnest.')
('Old Man Wang', "For today's lesson, we'll be learning five forms.<br/>I brought in two experts who will demonstrate them.")
('Old Man Wang', "I'll be watching everyone very carefully!")
('Old Man Wang', 'Now, then... Begin!')
('Old Man Wang', 'Third form: Twin Crescent Strike!')
('Van', '(Aww, crap. This is Twin Crescent Strike, so I gotta<br/>use both hands.)')
('Old Man Wang', 'Eighth form: Crushing Fist!')
('Van', '(Wait, I gotta swing it upward.)')
('Old Man Wang', 'Tenth form: Elbow Thrust!')
('Van', "(No, I gotta use my elbow for this one. It's in<br/>the name!)")
('Old Man Wang', 'Fifteenth form: Swallow Stance!')
('Van', '(Wait, I need to use my left leg.)')
('Old Man Wang', 'Twenty-first form: Rapid Chop!')
('Van', '(Other way around.)')
('Old Man Wang', 'Well done!')
('Old Man Wang', 'Hmm... An adequate performance.')
('Old Man Wang', "Thanks to you, today's class went off without a hitch.<br/>Young people these days sure are something else!")
('Feri', 'So what are you going to do about tomorrow?')
('Old Man Wang', 'I expect my back should be fine by then, so I plan to<br/>teach the lesson tomorrow.')
('Agnès', "Are you sure you'll be okay?")
('Bracer Xiaoling', 'I can help out again if need be.')
('Bracer Xiaoling', "But I'm not sure if you need it. Considering your age,<br/>you're in shockingly great shape.")
('Bracer Xiaoling', "Your form is good, too—maybe even too good.<br/>I somehow doubt you're doing martial arts just to stay<br/>in good health.")
('Old Man Wang', "Well, well. I didn't expect to be found out after all<br/>these years.")
('Old Man Wang', 'Allow me to let you in on a little-known secret: in my<br/>youth, I stole techniques from many schools and<br/>made them my own.')
('Old Man Wang', "I'm a warrior of darkness who's imbued his hands in<br/>the blood of the greatest masters in all of Zemuria.")
('Old Man Wang', 'My true identity is...Bloodstained Fist Wang!')
('Feri', '*gasp*')
('Bracer Xiaoling', "I-I've never heard that name before!")
('Old Man Wang', "Well, of course you haven't.")
('Old Man Wang', 'I made it up.')
('Bracer Xiaoling', '...Huh?')
('Old Man Wang', "I'm quite good at coming up with cool nicknames on<br/>the spot, if I do say so myself.")
('Old Man Wang', 'Bloodstained Fist Wang... Yes, it has a nice ring to it.<br/>I insist on being addressed as such from now on.')
('Bracer Xiaoling', 'No.')
('Bracer Xiaoling', "I can't believe I was fooled by this old coot.")
('Agnès', 'Ahaha...')
('Feri', "He got me again. I can't believe it...")
('Van', "This guy's a character.")
('Van', "You sure you don't want a cut? The 50-50 offer's still<br/>on the table.")
('Bracer Xiaoling', 'I know, but I want you guys to have it all.')
('Bracer Xiaoling', "I feel like I've already got my share, anyway.")
('Bracer Xiaoling', 'This helped me discover a new way to spread the true<br/>Gekka throughout the world.')
('Bracer Xiaoling', 'And as a bonus, I got to learn about all of you guys.')
('Agnès', "Huh? What'd you learn about Feri and me?")
('Bracer Xiaoling', 'A few things.')
('Bracer Xiaoling', "The biggest one being that you're exactly as you look:<br/>a couple of good kids.")
('Feri', 'Aww...')
('Bracer Xiaoling', 'As for you, spriggan, I wrote you off as a shady<br/>person at first glance, which is part of why I was<br/>hesitant to work with you initially.')
('Bracer Xiaoling', "But I shouldn't judge a book by its cover. I can tell<br/>you're diligent and disciplined, given how polished<br/>your Kunlun forms were.")
('Bracer Xiaoling', 'I now understand why Zin trusts you so much.')
('Van', 'Think you got the wrong idea about me. I just had a<br/>good master who drilled those forms into me.')
('Van', "Won't complain about you havin' a better impression<br/>of us, though.")
('Bracer Xiaoling', "Heehee. Let's just leave it at that, then.")
('System', 'Quest Substitute Sensei completed!')
('System', 'Earned')
('System', 'Received')
('Aaron', 'So, where we headed?')
('Van', 'To the Kowloon Hotel. I wanna ask the receptionist<br/>there some questions.')
('Van', "I should be able to get plenty of info out of 'em since<br/>Heiyue's my client.")
('Van', "I'm sure they want this Almata mess cleaned up nice<br/>and quickly.")
('Aaron', "They're probably kicking themselves for letting the<br/>mafia in the door. It's their fault for<br/>underestimating outsiders.")
('Van', "So we've got them to deal with as well as<br/>these cheaters.")
('Van', "If they really are doin' illegal gambling, then we may<br/>need some backup.")
('Van', 'I might call up a couple of experts I know.')
('Aaron', 'What kinda experts we talking about?')
('Van', "You'll find out soon enough.")
('Receptionist Humin', 'Welcome, Mr. Arkride.')
('Receptionist Humin', 'Oh, and I see Aaron is accompanying you as well.')
('Receptionist Humin', 'How may I help you two gentlemen this evening?')
('Van', 'We got a few questions for Heiyue.')
('Aaron', "We're trying to find those damn cheaters. You know<br/>anything about them?")
('Receptionist Humin', "Oh, we're actually in the middle of investigating that<br/>matter as we speak.")
('Receptionist Humin', "We've uncovered a few things, including the fact that<br/>the cheaters are linked to A.")
('Receptionist Humin', "I also know about the incident involving your friend.<br/>It's a good thing he avoided the worst-case scenario.")
('Receptionist Humin', "Had he not been able to pay up, he would've been<br/>handed over to A.")
('Receptionist Humin', "That's about all we know at present.")
('Van', "Sounds like their info lines up with Syd's.")
('Aaron', "I'm gonna make those cheating bastards pay.")
('Aaron', "Though I wouldn't have to if Heiyue would step in,<br/>but they seem content with letting them roam freely.")
('Van', "If you're fine leakin' us info...")
('Van', "...then I'm gonna assume Heiyue's cool with us<br/>tackling this issue however we want.")
('Receptionist Humin', 'Yes. You may deal with them as you see fit.')
('Receptionist Humin', "Those two aren't official agents of A, so they're of<br/>little concern to us.")
('Aaron', 'Really, now.')
('Receptionist Humin', "At present, they're relaxing in their room.")
('Receptionist Humin', 'Would you like me to relay a message to them?')
('Van', 'Not right now.')
('Detective Dart', "...Pardon? I don't know what you're talking about.")
('Van', "There's no need to be coy.")
('Van', "We already know that you're keepin' an eye on the<br/>Messeldam Trading Company.")
('Van', "I can tell you're from around here, so I've got a pretty<br/>good guess as to what your real job is. I could reveal<br/>it myself...")
('Van', "...but I'll let my buddy here do the honors.")
('Aaron', 'Are you seriously testing me? Screw off.')
('Aaron', "(Fine, I'll play along.)")
('Aaron', "(I've seen this guy around town a few times, now that<br/>I think about it.)")
('Aaron', "(He's most likely a...)")
('Aaron', "(A bracer who's gone incognito to<br/>investigate Almata?)")
('Aaron', "(Nah, that's outsider behavior. A local bracer<br/>wouldn't do that.)")
('Aaron', "(Doubt they'd need to plant a spy here to get info<br/>on Almata. They can just lean on their info network.)")
('Aaron', "(It's more likely that he's a...)")
('Aaron', "Given that you're doing a stakeout of this place...")
('Aaron', "...I'd guess that you're either a cop or a detective.")
('Aaron', "And here I thought the Langport police were all<br/>useless, but you're out here trying to beat<br/>the stereotype. Hats off to you.")
('Detective Dart', 'Shh... Keep your voices down.')
('Detective Dart', 'If you wish to talk, follow me.')
('Van', 'Not bad, kid.')
('Aaron', "Don't patronize me, asshole.")
('Detective Dart', 'So, what can I do for the famous Langport prodigy<br/>and the spriggan?')
('Detective Dart', 'Did you say you wanted information on the<br/>cheating duo?')
('Van', "Yeah. All we know is that they're connected to A—<br/>but apparently they aren't official members.")
('Van', "Yeah. All we know is that they're connected to A.")
('Aaron', 'Got anything else for us?')
('Detective Dart', "I do. Our primary target is A, so I don't mind<br/>divulging this information.")
('Detective Dart', "Like you said, they aren't official members of A.")
('Detective Dart', 'The two of them and the part-time gangsters have<br/>only just been hired.')
('Detective Dart', "They aren't official members of A.")
('Detective Dart', 'The two of them and the part-time gangsters have<br/>only just been hired.')
('Detective Dart', 'Samson and Richie have made a splash in the<br/>gambling scene.')
('Detective Dart', 'They caused quite a stir back in Messeldam.')
('Detective Dart', 'Unfortunately for them, they pressed their luck.<br/>They set their sights on swindling A out of their<br/>money, and they paid the price for it.')
('Detective Dart', "They were collared and put on tight leashes. The two<br/>were given jaeger dropout bodyguards, but otherwise,<br/>they're being treated like dogs.")
('Detective Dart', 'To A, they are on the same level as the<br/>part-time gangsters.')
('Van', "Well, ain't that convenient.")
('Aaron', "So in other words, they're expendable—which means<br/>we can bring them down without fear of retaliation.")
('Detective Dart', 'Huh? What are you two plotting?')
('Van', "Nothin'. He's just messin' with you.")
('Van', "We're gonna resolve this nice and peacefully.")
('Aaron', 'Yeah, what he said.')
('Aaron', 'Thanks for the info! ♪')
('Detective Dart', '...Right. Anyway, just stay out of our way from<br/>here on.')
('Aaron', "So, what's the plan?")
('Aaron', 'We gonna bust into their hotel room and rip them a<br/>new asshole?')
('Van', 'You wish.')
('Van', "That'd just leave a big ol' mess for Heiyue to clean up,<br/>and I'd rather not be indebted to Heiyue.")
('Van', "It'd also make it harder for me to move around freely.")
('Van', "I got a better idea. Instead of fightin' with fists, I say<br/>we fight with cards.")
('Aaron', 'You wanna gamble with them?')
('Van', "That's right.")
('Aaron', 'Heh. You never struck me as the high-rolling type.')
('Aaron', "I considered that option, too, but I tossed the idea<br/>when I realized Syd and I wouldn't stand a chance.")
('Aaron', 'You confident in your card-playing skills?')
('Van', 'More or less.')
('Van', "Although, I'm probably not as self-assured as you.")
('Van', "Jack told me you normally win one in every three<br/>games against him. That's no small feat.")
('Van', 'But what if I told you I win two in every five games<br/>against him?')
('Aaron', "Ohh. You think you're better than me, huh?")
('Aaron', "Who's calling who self-assured?")
('Van', "I'm just speakin' objectively here. I can hold my own<br/>in a round of cards.")
('Van', 'That said, our opponents are at least as good as Halle.')
('Van', "If we challenge them by ourselves, the deck'll be<br/>stacked against us.")
('Van', "So I say we up the odds by stackin' our own deck with<br/>a couple of aces—or more specifically, a Jack and<br/>a Halle.")
('Aaron', "You're the man with the plan. I'm surprised at how<br/>calm you are about all this.")
('Van', "Right back at'cha. I had you pegged as a dumb,<br/>reckless brat who ran headlong into danger.")
('Van', "But tonight's taught me you can think<br/>things through.")
('Aaron', "I've got brains and brawn. I'm the whole package.")
('Aaron', "Don't blame you for thinking of me that way, though.<br/>I know I get into a lot of fights—but I really don't<br/>enjoy pointless conflict.")
('Aaron', 'The people in the Eastern Quarter are the closest<br/>thing I have to a family.')
('Van', "You...don't have any relatives?")
('Aaron', 'Nah. My mom died when I was a kid.')
('Aaron', 'So the people in town took me in and treated me like<br/>one of their own.')
('Aaron', "Even Heiyue's had my back over the years.")
('Aaron', "That used to be true of Lǎo Yéye, too, but he's been...<br/>distancing himself from me lately.")
('Van', 'Hmm...')
('Aaron', "Anyway, I'm just trying to do what I can for the<br/>people here.")
('Aaron', "I won't let anyone tie me down, though. I've always<br/>done whatever the hell I wanted—and that's not<br/>gonna change.")
('Van', 'Is that right?')
('Aaron', '...Wait, why the hell am I spilling my guts to you?')
('Aaron', 'Can we go back to talking about the plan now?')
('Van', 'Sure thing.')
('Van', 'As far as I can tell, Samson and Richie are<br/>genuine gamblers.')
('Van', "They might be cheaters, but their skills are legit.<br/>I'd bet they're on another level from us.")
('Van', "Probably fancy themselves as bein' on the same plane<br/>as Jack and Halle.")
('Aaron', 'And they want everyone else to think so, too, which is<br/>why they challenged Halle.')
('Aaron', "But they've steered clear of Jack so far.")
('Aaron', "Which is fair. Jack's basically a living legend<br/>among gamblers.")
('Aaron', "You've gotta be on your A-game and have all the luck<br/>in the world to take him down.")
('Van', "Exactly. Even if you're a cheating bastard, winning<br/>won't come easy against him.")
('Van', "So we're gonna make the idea of challenging him<br/>less intimidating. Any guesses as to what I have<br/>in mind?")
('Aaron', 'Hmm... We gonna bait them with something?')
('Aaron', "Ooh. I get it. We're the bait.")
('Van', 'Bingo.')
('Van', "Now, let's go get Jack and Halle on board.")
('Samson', "Well, well. It's the man, the myth, the legend in<br/>the flesh.")
('Samson', 'We meet at long last, Jack. So good of you to come<br/>out here to play.')
('Richie', "And he brought King's adorable little daughter<br/>with him. It's been, what, a week since we last saw<br/>each other?")
('Richie', 'Ready to get your butt whooped again?')
('Halle', "Grr... I'll be doing the butt whooping this time!")
('Jack', "Don't let them rile you up, Halle. A gambler's always<br/>gotta keep their poker face up.")
('Halle', 'I-I know.')
('Van', 'I take it Jack told you about us over the phone?')
('Aaron', "Mind going easy on us? We're just a couple<br/>of newbies.")
('Samson', "Ah, so you're the prodigy and the spriggan. We never<br/>heard of you back in Messeldam.")
('Richie', "If you're only rookies, then you made a big mistake<br/>coming here.")
('Richie', "You just dropped into the lion's den, and we're gonna<br/>tear you limb from limb.")
('Van', "Oooh. I'm shakin' in my boots here.")
('Aaron', 'Bet you guys are all bark and no bite.')
('Jack', "All right, that's enough trash talk. We don't have<br/>all day.")
('Jack', "Let's get this game on the road.")
('Samson', "All right, then. Let's play.")
('Richie', "Can't wait to finally dethrone the king of gambling.")
('Richie', 'Your lucky streak is about to come to an end, Jack.')
('Samson', "We'll be playing poker in pairs of two, as we agreed.")
('Samson', "No peeking at your partner's hands, though.")
('Samson', "At the end of the game, we'll tally up the chips, and<br/>the team with the most will be declared the winner.")
('Samson', 'Sound good?')
('Jack', 'Works for me.')
('Jack', "So who's dealin'? Your bodyguards?")
('Halle', "I'll be watching them like a hawk.")
('Halle', "If I spot them cheating in any way, it'll be your loss.")
('Samson', 'Fine by me. These guys know next to nothing about<br/>gambling, anyway.')
('Samson', "They're just a couple of bodyguards we hired through<br/>the Messeldam Trading Company.")
('Richie', "This is a battle between warriors who've honed their<br/>craft to an art. We're not gonna cheat—the victory<br/>won't feel earned if we do.")
('Van', "Hah. And here I thought you had no pride—but now<br/>I see it's just fickle.")
('Aaron', "We'll see if they stick to their word.")
('Halle', "Ugh. Samson and Richie aren't full of hot air after all.")
('Aaron', "They're no pushovers, that's for sure. It's been a close<br/>game so far.")
('Aaron', "I think our boys will pull through, though. The old<br/>fart's putting up a good fight.")
('Halle', "Yeah, he's doing great.")
('Van', '(Had to pull a few tricks out of my hat to get this<br/>full house.)')
('Van', '(This is a slam dunk.)')
('Jack', "*cough* *cough* Sorry 'bout that.")
('Jack', 'Is it just me, or is the air dry in here?')
('Van', 'Yeah, a little.')
('Van', "(Jack's givin' me one of his signals.)")
('Van', '(What should I do?)')
('Van', '(Coughing is the sign for folding...)')
('Van', "(...but I really don't think I can lose with this hand.)")
('Van', "(Sorry, Jack, but I'm gonna make the play!)")
('Van', 'Call. Full house.')
('Richie', 'Heheh. Sucks for you.')
('Van', 'What?')
('Richie', "I've got a full house, too.")
('Richie', 'Except mine has a ten, so we win!')
('Samson', 'Heheheh. Score one for us!')
('Jack', 'Damn. They got you good.')
('Aaron', "C'mon, man. Get your act together.")
('Halle', 'Looks like they were one step ahead of you.')
('Van', '(Coughing is the sign for folding.)')
('Van', "(Can't imagine I'd lose with this hand...)")
('Van', '(...but I need to put my trust into Jack.)')
('Van', "Fold. I'm out this round.")
('Richie', "Damn. Wasn't expecting you to fold.")
('Samson', "You're just full of surprises, aren't you, spriggan?")
('Jack', 'Oof. Dodged a bullet there.')
('Jack', 'Good call, Van.')
('Van', 'Just had a gut feeling.')
('Van', '(Thanks for the save, Jack.)')
('Aaron', 'Nice going.')
('Halle', "It's always good to know when to pull back.")
('System', 'The heated battle raged on, both sides unrelenting as<br/>the tide shifted back and forth.')
('System', 'Eventually, it all came to a head, where folding would<br/>spell certain defeat—and the victor would lay claim to<br/>every chip on the table.')
('Van', "(Okay. I've got the cards for a straight.)")
('Jack', "Well, frick. I got bad cards. Tonight just ain't<br/>my night.")
('Van', 'Pull yourself together, man. I need you to have your<br/>head in the game.')
('Samson', "You aren't fooling anyone, you know.")
('Richie', "We know you're up to something.")
('Van', "(He's putting his right hand on his face.<br/>That's another one of Jack's signs.)")
('Van', '(I gotta discard one of my cards, but which one?)')
('Van', '(Jack wants me to discard the king.)')
('Van', '(He must be aiming for a four of a kind with kings.)')
('Van', "(Although, he did tell me to aim for a straight flush if<br/>it's within reach.)")
('Van', "(Guess I'll discard the jack, then.)")
('Van', 'All right. Swapping a card.')
('Van', "(That's Jack for you. Always well prepared.)")
('Van', 'A straight flush of hearts. Well, how about that?')
('Samson', 'WH-WHAT?! I lost with four aces?!')
('Richie', 'Shit. We underestimated you.')
('Jack', 'And that cost you the game.')
('Aaron', "He didn't do half bad.")
('Halle', 'Heehee. Van and Jack make a great team.')
('Halle', "I'm almost jealous.")
('Van', '(Jack wants me to discard the king.)')
('Van', '(He must be aiming for a four of a kind with kings.)')
('Van', "(I'd like to be the one to lead us to victory...)")
('Van', '(...but when the chips are down, you can always bet<br/>on Jack.)')
('Van', 'All right. Swapping a card.')
('Van', 'Welp. No pairs for me.')
('Van', "Hope you're luckier than I was.")
('Jack', 'Well, see for yourself.')
('Richie', 'Four kings. Well done.')
('Samson', 'However...')
('Samson', "...it won't be enough to beat THIS!")
('Jack', "...Did you hit your head or something? That's three<br/>of a kind.")
('Samson', 'Wait, what?!')
('Samson', "That's not possible! I KNOW I had four aces!")
('Richie', 'Wh-What the hell happened?!')
('Aaron', 'That was like a magic trick.')
('Halle', "That was one of King's special techniques. It<br/>let him control his opponents cards. Jack's the<br/>only other person who can use it.")
('Halle', "I haven't seen that move in a long time.")
('Jack', 'You guys are down 500,000 mira.')
('Jack', 'Wanna keep going?')
('Samson', "O-Of course we will! We're not gonna back down<br/>after a loss like that!")
('Richie', "We're done with you, though, Jack.")
('Richie', "I wanna play Halle and the redheaded guy.<br/>We're gonna squeeze 'em dry.")
('Halle', 'Yes! Eat that!')
('Aaron', 'So what was that about squeezing us dry?')
('Samson', 'This is humiliating...')
('Richie', "It's one thing to lose to Jack, but getting our shit<br/>kicked in by these nobodies is just plain embarrassing.")
('Halle', 'You expended all of your luck in your match with<br/>Jack and Van.')
('Aaron', "And now you're down 1,000,000 mira.")
('Aaron', 'Time to pay up.')
('Samson', 'Guess we have no other recourse...')
('Samson', '...except to run away!')
('Richie', "Let's scram!")
('Halle', 'Eeek!')
('Jack', 'Halle! Get down!')
('Van', 'Gah! Damn flash grenade!')
('Aaron', 'Cowards!')
('Aaron', "We can't let them get away!")
('Van', "Then let's go after 'em!")
('Van', 'You two handle things here!')
('Jack', 'You got it.')
('Halle', 'Good luck!')
('Van', "I don't have any business here.")
