(500, 'September 7th, 9:20PM')
('Van', "We're lucky the Direwolf and that bracer showed up<br/>when they did.")
('Van', "No, actually, I'm not sure we can chalk that up<br/>to luck.")
('Agnès', "Right, I don't think we can, either.")
('Agnès', "The bracer came to investigate the monsters'<br/>strange behavior.")
('Agnès', 'And the Direwolf had his own reasons to be here...')
('Walter the Direwolf', "...I'm lookin' for a wild mutt who's been let off his<br/>leash—a guy with mint green hair. Ring any bells?")
('Melchior', "I can't say I did, no. There were no other living<br/>beings in sight.")
('Feri', "Didn't that man from earlier say no one was here?")
('Feri', 'Then he was lying. If Aida came from this direction,<br/>then the Eisenschild camp must be nearby.')
('Van', 'Yeah. That guy was definitely bullshitting us.')
('Van', "And there's no way a normal guy could get around<br/>those monsters. We barely scraped by ourselves.")
('Feri', "They kept getting up no matter how many times we<br/>knocked them down. It's like they weren't even alive.")
('Feri', 'They almost reminded me of the ghouls from the<br/>stories they used to tell back home...')
('Feri', "No... That can't be what's going on here! It just<br/>can't be!")
('Agnès', 'Feri...')
('Agnès', 'Why now?')
('Feri', "It's glowing again...")
('Van', "That's a telltale sign that something's up.")
('Van', 'Feels like the higher elements are active here, too.')
('Van', "The camp's probably over on that plateau. Ready<br/>to move?")
('Feri', "I've never been more ready!")
('Agnès', "Let's get moving, then!")
('Feri', '*gasp*')
('Agnès', 'This is awful...')
('Feri', 'Why, Aida? Why are you doing this?')
('Van', "Those guys've got the same eyes as those hounds.")
('Aida', "That's right. They're all lifeless shells of their former<br/>selves—dolls that act purely on instinct.")
('Aida', "Maybe it's just karma at work—divine retribution for<br/>our sins. Hard to say.")
('Feri', '...')
('Agnès', 'Oh, Goddess... What happened ten days ago?')
('Aida', "Really want to know? Well, I'll tell you.")
('Aida', 'The short version is...we were defeated—completely<br/>and utterly.')
('Feri', '...?!')
('Van', "And what's the long version?")
('Aida', "It all began two weeks ago. We were cornered by one<br/>of the CID's Hercules units.")
('Aida', "I'd heard they pick fights with jaegers in Calvard<br/>sometimes, so it wasn't too much of a shock.")
('Aida', 'But in the end, we were no match for them.<br/>We found an opening in their formation and<br/>narrowly escaped.')
('Aida', 'After that, we made our way to Creil and rested at<br/>their inn. Then we set up camp here and started<br/>brainstorming ideas for how to get back home.')
('Aida', "And that's when those bastards appeared.")
('Aida', 'We were attacked by a band of merciless savages—led<br/>by three leaders whose power was...unfathomable.')
('Aida', 'It was a massacre. They led us to ruin like lambs to<br/>the slaughter.')
('Aida', 'They picked us off one by one...until no<br/>one remained.')
('Aida', 'No one...but me.')
('Aida', 'The next thing I knew, I woke up here.')
('Aida', 'When I came to, the first thing I saw was that device<br/>up there. It was emitting that ominous red light back<br/>then, too.')
('Aida', "My comrades were still breathing, but they weren't<br/>exactly alive. All they could do was writhe<br/>and moan.")
('Aida', 'It was like no one had any will of their own. I was the<br/>only one who could move of their own accord...')
('Aida', "...except in the sunlight. I couldn't stand it anymore.<br/>And I didn't feel hunger—at least, not for a while.")
('Aida', 'During the daytime, all I could do was cower in my<br/>tent and wait for night to fall.')
('Aida', 'There was no way I could contact the rest of the<br/>corps—not in this state. Then all of a sudden, I<br/>developed a strange...craving.')
('Aida', 'Our military monsters started coming back to life—<br/>and they were acting without orders.')
('Aida', "And my fallen comrades picked themselves off<br/>the ground... But as you can see, they<br/>aren't themselves...")
('Feri', "I-I'm...so sorry, Aida...*sob*")
('Agnès', "That's horrible. Why would those people kill<br/>your men? Were they the ones responsible for turning<br/>them into...that?")
('Aida', 'Yeah. I think they used that device up there to do it.<br/>I tried to climb the pillar a few times to get a closer<br/>look at it...')
('Aida', "...but my body locks up every time I try. Almost like<br/>I'm being controlled by some unseen force.")
('Aida', "I'm not gonna dance to the tune of a puppet master.<br/>That's why I'm ending it all—with my own<br/>two hands.")
('Feri', "N-No! You can't do that!")
('Van', "So that's your endgame. You'd rather go out in a<br/>blaze of glory than die as a pawn in someone<br/>else's game...")
('Aida', 'You got it. The flames of purification come up all the<br/>time in ghoul-related legends, right?')
('Aida', "So it's time for me to burn. The longer I stand here<br/>with you, the harder it gets to stave off this<br/>insatiable hunger...")
('Aida', 'It makes me wanna suck up every last drop of blood<br/>in your bodies. It makes me wanna feast on<br/>your flesh. Even Feri looks like a nice appetizer...')
('Aida', "I could have that young lady as my main dish...<br/>But too bad that'd make a stringy-looking dude like<br/>you an unsavory last course.")
('Feri', '...')
('Van', 'Damn. Low blow.')
('Agnès', 'Stop this nonsense right now, Aida.')
('Agnès', "You aren't fooling anyone with this charade.<br/>You're still alive and in control, so we won't let you<br/>give up.")
('Agnès', "We know you kept your distance from the villagers<br/>and tried to steer us out of harm's way—which you're<br/>still trying to do now.")
('Agnès', "But why don't you consider Feri's feelings for<br/>a moment?")
('Agnès', 'She left her home for the first time in her life—<br/>charging into a world unknown to her—and tracked<br/>Van down. All so she could find you.')
('Aida', '...')
('Feri', 'Agnès...')
('Van', 'Heh.')
('Agnès', 'If you really care about her, then you should at least<br/>be honest with her. You owe her that much.')
('Agnès', "While we're at it, let's find a way to save you. We can<br/>find a better solution together.")
('Agnès', "Because that's what Arkride Solutions does...<br/>We help people.")
('Feri', '...')
('Van', "Give this girl a little leeway and she starts actin' like<br/>she owns the place...")
('Van', "Now, normally I wouldn't let my assistant sign me up<br/>for work, but she's right. This is a job for a spriggan,<br/>so I'm all ears, Flameeater.")
('Van', "I don't mind bailin' out someone who helped with<br/>Operation Mille Mirage.")
('Feri', 'Van...')
('Aida', 'Haha...')
('Aida', 'I WAS being honest about wanting to suck<br/>your blood...')
('Aida', "...but I'll admit it's not like me to surrender while<br/>there's still life in me.")
('Aida', "It wouldn't be right to throw it all away. I'd be<br/>spitting in the face of Commander Geraint...")
('Aida', '...my puppy-like rival and sister...')
('Aida', '...and my old friends in Zephyr—like my other sister<br/>and the man I admired more than anyone.')
('Aida', "If I ended it all here, I wouldn't be able to face a<br/>single one of them. So I'll press on.")
('Feri', "Aida, I-I'm so...happy!")
('Agnès', "See? Everything's going to be all right.")
('Melchior', 'What a heartwarming scene! Those final lines moved<br/>me to tears! ♪')
('Melchior', 'Although, I am a little perplexed as to how you alone<br/>maintained your sense of self.')
('Melchior', 'But perhaps you had a stronger will to resist than that<br/>of your pathetic subordinates. You were the right<br/>hand of the Jaeger King, after all.')
('Feri', 'You...!')
('Van', 'Look what the cat dragged in.')
('Aida', "Hmph. Should've figured it was you.")
('Aida', 'I might be a little off my game, but I could still sense<br/>you lurking in the shadows.')
('Aida', 'You and those two Almata psychos left my<br/>comrades bleeding out on the ground.')
('Aida', "You'll pay for what you've done...Melchior of<br/>the Thorns!")
('Agnès', '...')
('Van', 'The last piece of the puzzle finally falls into place.')
('Melchior', 'Heehee. Why, thank you. You saved me the effort of<br/>introducing myself.')
('Melchior', 'Allow me to clarify one thing, though. I am a fresh<br/>hire for Almata. I was with friends of a different crew<br/>when we annihilated your unit.')
('Melchior', "Although, the job did still come from my current<br/>boss, so I suppose I'm splitting hairs.")
('Aida', "That tracks. My unit wouldn't fall so easily to<br/>homegrown mafia goons.")
('Aida', "I take it you're the one who put that device up there?")
('Melchior', 'That I did! I had the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity<br/>to experiment with bringing the dead back to life—<br/>and I seized it.')
('Melchior', 'Yet our boss says the device is of little importance.<br/>Curious, no?')
('Agnès', 'Wh-What?')
('Van', "The hell're you on about?")
('Melchior', 'Still, the experiment is in full swing, and nothing will<br/>stop it from reaching its apex.')
('Aida', '...?!')
('Feri', 'The wires!')
('Melchior', "Now, let's throw a little twist into the mix.")
('Aida', 'AAAAARGH!')
('Feri', "What's wrong, Aida?!")
('Aida', "Well...shit... This isn't good...")
('Aida', 'You have to get out of here... Just forget about me<br/>and go! RUUUUN!')
('Feri', 'Aida, no! Stay with us!')
('Agnès', 'H-How could he...?')
('Van', "Damn it. That bastard's gonna pay...but we'll worry<br/>about him later. Ready your weapons, you two!")
('Van', "Our first order of business is calming her down.<br/>We'll get your sister back, I promise!")
('Feri', '...!')
('Feri', 'Right!')
('Agnès', "We'll save you, Aida!")
('Melchior', 'Ahaha! What fun! Let the bloodbath...begin!')
('Aida', "Haha... You're all...pretty damn strong.")
('Feri', 'Aida!')
('Agnès', "I think that did the trick. She's back to normal!")
('Melchior', 'Great show! Bravo!')
('Melchior', 'In fact, it was so delightfully entertaining, I demand<br/>an encore! ♪')
('Van', "Don't you dare!")
('Aida', 'GAAAAAAH!')
('Feri', 'NOOOOOO! Aida! Snap out of it!')
('Agnès', 'Stop this right now! How... How can you be<br/>so cruel?!')
('Van', "Gah...<br/>(I gotta take out at least one of 'em...)")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Hey! How come no one invited me to the party?<br/>I'm feelin' left out!")
('Melchior', 'Whoa, there, big guy!')
('Van', "Your timing's been scarily on point, Direwolf.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Heheh. I just got done puttin' those rabid dogs in<br/>the ground.")
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Then some timely help arrived, so I left the village in<br/>their capable hands.')
('Van', 'Oh?')
('Walter the Direwolf', 'I finally found you.')
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Enjoying your new life as a mafia exec, I take it?')
('Melchior', "Indeed. Well met, Enforcer No. VIII. I didn't think<br/>I'd run into you here.")
('Melchior', "You'll have to excuse me for keeping my<br/>distance, though. Word on the street says you play<br/>VERY rough.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Hey, don't be shy. I'm not gonna bite ya...as long as<br/>you quit draggin' out this game of keep away.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "I've got a list of questions from the Oathbreaker, so<br/>start running your mouth—or I'll run my fist through<br/>your face.")
('Melchior', "Mmm, I'll pass. I'm a man who enjoys playing hard to<br/>get, so you'll have to chase me down if you want<br/>those answers.")
('Melchior', "Besides, our goals may not be aligned, but they aren't<br/>in conflict, either. Why don't you let me go—")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Like hell I'd do that!")
('Agnès', '(The Genesis!)')
('Melchior', 'Ahaha! On that note, I shall bid you farewell.')
('Melchior', "You may do as you will with the device...assuming<br/>you don't die horrible, gruesome deaths, that is!")
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Get back here, you little bitch!')
('Agnès', 'Umm...')
('Van', "Don't worry about them! We've got our own problems<br/>to deal with!")
(61160, 'U...gh...')
(61160, 'Fe...ri...')
('Feri', 'A-Aida?')
('Agnès', 'Feri, no!')
('Feri', '...')
('Agnès', '...')
('Van', 'Raaaaaah!')
('Van', 'Gaaah!')
('Agnès', 'Van!')
('Feri', 'You shielded me and Agnès... Why?')
('Van', "Why do you think? I obviously can't let my clients or<br/>part-timers get hurt on my watch. Shit's bad for<br/>the brand.")
('Van', "(Damn it. I must've broke a rib. I'm not gonna be<br/>able to fight back in this state...)")
('Van', '(Crap. What do I do?)')
('Feri', "Wh-Why'd she stop?")
('Agnès', 'The Geneses are...resonating with one another?')
('Mare', '*sigh* Got your butts kicked again, huh?')
('Feri', 'What is THAT?!')
('Agnès', 'Mare!')
('Van', "Well, well. If it ain't the sentient AI.")
('Van', 'What are you, anyway? Are you really my holo?')
('Mare', "What kind of question is that? Of course I am.<br/>I'm the one and only Mare!")
('Mare', 'Anyway, congrats! You unlocked a new power!<br/>So, ready to give it a whirl?')
('Van', 'You bet!')
('Mare', "Sweet! Let's do it, then!")
('Mare', "Shard swell! The Grendel's all yours!")
(61160, 'Rrrrrrgh!')
('Feri', "Van...? Wh-What's happening?")
('Agnès', "She's resonating with Feri, and it's feeding Van<br/>with energy!")
(61160, 'RAAAAAAAH!')
('Van/Grendel', 'OHHHHHHHH!')
(40501, 'GAAAAAAAH!')
('Aida', '*pant* *pant* *pant*')
('Aida', "Haha. I'm impressed.")
('Feri', 'Aida!')
('Agnès', 'Van! Are you okay?!')
('Van', "*pant* Couple bruises, but otherwise, I'm fine.")
('Van', "But...wish we could've got something out of Mare<br/>this time.")
('Feri', 'Thank goodness! Here, let me treat those wounds<br/>for—')
('Aida', "Haha... Appreciate the thought, but I...don't think<br/>it'll do any good.")
('Feri', 'Wha...?')
('Feri', '*gasp*')
('Agnès', 'The Goddess is calling them home...')
('Van', '...')
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'Too late.')
('Commander Geraint', 'True, but we can at least see her off.')
('Feri', 'Abi!')
('Aida', "I didn't think you'd ALL come.")
('Vice Chief Hasan', "You have no idea how worried I've been, Ferida.")
('Commander Geraint', "I read your letter while we were on the road. It sounds<br/>like you've been through a lot.")
('Aida', "Wish I could've put up more of a fight...but at least I<br/>jotted down what I learned about my attackers.")
('Aida', 'Hopefully you can put those notes to good use—if<br/>you ever run into them.')
('Commander Geraint', "Of course. We won't let your efforts be in vain.")
('Commander Geraint', 'May you finally know peace, bearers of the<br/>iron shield.')
('Feri', '...!')
('Feri', 'N-No...')
('Commander Geraint', '...')
('Aida', "I'm forever in your debt, both of you.")
('Aida', 'Thanks for giving me this chance to talk with my<br/>sweet little sister...one last time.')
('Agnès', 'Oh, Aida...')
('Van', '...')
('Feri', "You can't go! You still haven't told me those stories<br/>about your old corps. You promised, remember!")
('Aida', "Haha... Don't worry your pretty little head.<br/>I'm sure you can hear all about Zephyr from<br/>someone else.")
('Aida', 'You can ask my other little sister, even.')
('Feri', 'No, not from someone else!<br/>I wanna hear them from YOU!')
('Aida', 'You still have...so much growing up to do. I want you<br/>to get strong.')
('Aida', "That's why...I need you to do one last thing for me:<br/>finish me off.")
('Feri', '...?!')
('Agnès', 'What?!')
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'Grant her final wish, Ferida.')
('Feri', 'But, Abi...')
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'If you hope to remain a warrior of our tribe, you must<br/>undergo this rite of passage.')
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'Do not let her kindness go to waste.')
('Feri', '...')
('Agnès', "Feri, don't!")
('Commander Geraint', 'Stay out of this.')
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'If you will not bear witness to it, I ask that you avert<br/>your eyes or leave immediately.')
('Feri', "I can't... I can't do it! I don't want to kill you!")
('Aida', 'Feri...')
('Van', "...That's enough. Can't you see she isn't ready for<br/>this yet?")
('Van', "This ain't a burden for a child to bear—so I'll bear it<br/>for her. It's my job to look out for my client.")
('Aida', '...')
('Feri', '...')
('Agnès', 'Van...')
('Vice Chief Hasan', '*sigh*')
('Commander Geraint', 'He may be right.')
('Feri', "Aida! Don't go!")
('Aida', "You've gotta grow up at some point...but I guess<br/>there's no need to rush.")
('Aida', "Thanks again. I'm grateful for everything<br/>you've done.")
('Aida', 'Farewell, Feri... Commander... Xeno and Leo... Fie...')
('Aida', "Yes... I'll finally be seeing you again...<br/>Rutger...")
('Feri', '*sob* Waaaaaah!')
('Bracer Alvis', "What in Aidios' name happened here?")
('Feri', 'Look! On top of the cliff!')
('Agnès', "How'd he get all the way up there...?")
('Van', "That's the question of the century.")
('Van', "It'd be bad news if he fell down from there...")
('Feri', "Why don't you two stay here? I've got this one.")
('Feri', "I'll be back in a flash—with a cat in tow!")
('Van', "No complaints here. We'll leave it to you.")
('Agnès', "If anything, it'll be good to have two of us down here<br/>should the worst come to pass.")
('Feri', 'Climbing this will be a breeze!')
('Nero', 'Meow?!')
('Feri', "There, there. Hope I didn't startle you, little buddy.<br/>You're not injured, are you?")
('Nero', 'M-Meow...')
('Nero', 'Meoooww. ♪')
('Feri', "Phew! Glad to hear it. You've calmed down a bunch,<br/>too, haven't you? Good kitty!")
('Agnès', 'Is everything all right up there, Feri?')
('Feri', "Yep, the kitty's safe now!")
('Feri', "The cute little thing's actually behaving himself<br/>this time.")
('Van', "Glad to hear it because that 'cute little thing' sure<br/>gave us a lot of grief...")
('Agnès', 'We should head back to the village, then.')
('Agnès', 'Lashkar and Annie must be worried sick.')
