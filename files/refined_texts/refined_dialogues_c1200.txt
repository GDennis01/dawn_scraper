('Maja', 'We had this huge group of devils right on Second<br/>Street over there.')
('Maja', 'Thankfully, we have it under control now.<br/>We banded together with the locals to drive<br/>them out.')
('Maja', "It made me appreciate just how tough jaegers are.<br/>Those guys handled stuff that I sure as hell wouldn't<br/>trust a civilian with.")
('Maja', "I'm gonna have to give 'em some downers later,<br/>though—they got a little too amped up for my liking<br/>once their stuff kicked in.")
('Maja', 'Those jaegers are some tough customers. You can<br/>always count on them when the going gets tough.')
('Maja', "I think they could use some tranquilizing<br/>herbs, though... I had them on some potent stuff<br/>back there. You don't wanna overdose on that.")
('Maja', "Man, they're really getting pelted up on the<br/>surface, huh?")
('Maja', "We don't have a complete picture of what's going on,<br/>but we don't turn away anybody who comes<br/>down here. That's our code.")
('Maja', "They need a place to stay, we'll take them. And if<br/>they need a little pick-me-up? Well, we've got just<br/>the thing for that, too!")
('Maja', "Y'know, I wasn't born in Calvard, but I still fit<br/>in here. I respect the Republic's values like that.")
('Maja', 'Freedom and equality for all, regardless of color<br/>or creed...')
('Maja', "Society doesn't always do a good job sticking to those<br/>tenets, but it's nice to have them outlined right in<br/>the constitution.")
('Maja', "Even people like me can find the place for them—<br/>and for me, that's the Blacklight District. So yeah, I<br/>don't mind celebrating a bit!")
('Maja', 'Yo there. Got a new flavor in stock, if you wanna<br/>check it out.')
('Maja', "Twice the cost, but twice the concentration for twice<br/>the high—and it's no more addictive than the<br/>weaker stuff. Wanna give it a shot?")
('Van', "Can't say I do, sorry. I'll pass.")
('Maja', "Ah, that's a shame. I worked hard on it for the<br/>festival, y'know—I made sure it's worth the price.")
('Maja', "But no worries—if you don't want it, you don't<br/>want it. Oh, and I've still got all my usual stock, in<br/>case you're craving something else.")
('Feri', "(It's kinda weird. It's still dark and gloomy down here,<br/>but it feels like everybody's really excited.)")
('Agnès', '(I guess even the Blacklight District gets swept up in<br/>the festival cheer.)')
('Maja', "I wish you'd try my new stuff. I poured a ton of work<br/>into it in time for the Revolution Festival. I just know<br/>it's worth your while.")
('Maja', "But hey, you do you. I've still got all my usual stock,<br/>so whatever you're in the market for, I've got'cha.")
('Maja', "*sigh* Almata just had to go off the deep end,<br/>didn't they?")
('Maja', "I don't buy the whole 'show of force' bit, personally.<br/>There's gotta be more to it than that, just my<br/>gut feeling.")
('Maja', "I'm feeling it, too—it's gone and knocked my supply<br/>routes out of commission. Business is gonna be real<br/>tough for a while...")
('Maja', 'I used to sell up on the surface until about two<br/>years ago. That was when those guys moved in and<br/>started dealing themselves—Almata, I mean.')
('Maja', "And man, they're ruthless. I couldn't tell you how<br/>many of my routes they've snatched up in those<br/>short years.")
('Maja', "I could swear they were after my head at one point.<br/>I went underground after that, and I don't regret that<br/>decision one bit.")
('Maja', "Blacklight's a good place to be. We have the boss<br/>watching out for us—A can't come slithering in like<br/>they usually do. It's safe here, y'know?")
('Maja', "My herbs get pretty good reviews—I promise you'll<br/>have a good time. Just take them in moderation,<br/>of course... Heh heh.")
('Maja', "And be careful who you do business with. Plenty of<br/>bad actors here in Edith who'll sell you dirty stuff.<br/>It can get you in real trouble.")
('Maja', 'For a while, I remember A was trafficking these<br/>shady steroids.')
('Maja', "Guys say it's real good when you take it, but it wrecks<br/>you in the long run. I'd steer clear of that stuff if I<br/>were you.")
('Maja', 'Hey there! Can I interest you in any of my<br/>specialty herbs? Satisfaction guaranteed, heh heh.')
('Maja', "Before you ask, all my stuff is all safe and street legal.<br/>I'm just here to give people a good time.")
('Maja', "I do have some of the grayer stuff, but I've had issues<br/>with people not using it right. Can't trust those boys<br/>with it, so I don't advertise it.")
('Maja', "I told them to be careful with that stuff, but no dice.<br/>But, well, that's what I get for dealing with<br/>those types. Never again.")
('Van', "(Way she talks, it sounds like her stuff's on<br/>the up-and-up. You just gotta use it wisely and you'll<br/>be fine.)")
('Zin the Immovable', "(Interesting. Maybe I'll take a look at her inventory—<br/>partly because I'm curious and partly to make sure<br/>she's sticking to her word.)")
('Maja', 'You know, I had some funky hookahs come in<br/>through Tharbad.')
('Maja', 'I had them for sale for a hot minute, but then I heard<br/>the police were going around clearing them off<br/>the streets.')
('Maja', "I open them up and, sure enough, they've got some<br/>real hardcore stuff in them. I pulled them after that—<br/>it's just not worth it.")
('Maja', "I'm not in that kinda business. I sell good times,<br/>not lifetimes.")
('Feri', '(She must be talking about those orbal hookahs.<br/>Good to hear the police got rid of them here, too!)')
('Van', "(Generally, the longer a shop's been around, the<br/>better the vendors know what to sell and not sell.<br/>This lady here's a bit of an outlier, but still.)")
('Van', "(It ain't THAT scary, shoppin' down here—just<br/>remember where those lines are and make sure you<br/>don't cross 'em. All right?)")
('Agnès', "(Right! That's good to know!)")
('Yimai', "Blacklight's important to a lot of us. It lets us do our<br/>business in peace, free from prying eyes.")
('Yimai', "So I don't care WHO Almata sends down here, I'm<br/>not giving them one rege of our turf! If anything of<br/>mine would help, you let me know.")
('Yimai', "We're counting on you young'uns! Don't let us down!")
('Yimai', "I dunno what in the world those demon-looking<br/>things are, and I'm clueless as to why all those guys<br/>are frozen in place...")
('Yimai', "...but this is the Blacklight District! It'll take more<br/>than a couple of freakshows to rattle us.")
('Yimai', "I've got these protective amulets for sale, if<br/>you're interested. No idea if they work at all, but it<br/>can't hurt to give them a try.")
('Yimai', "I've known old Filenkov for decades now. He and I<br/>must go back...oh, 30 years, probably.")
('Yimai', 'Oddball, for sure, but customers like him are a<br/>rare breed.')
('Yimai', "Although I can't remember how long it's been since I<br/>last saw him in person. He hasn't really aged<br/>gracefully, has he?")
('Yimai', "I got to sell off that lovely vase today—business is just<br/>booming these days! I'm on cloud nine, hoho!")
('Yimai', "Hmm...? Now, you don't look very sunny, sonny.<br/>What's got you down?")
('Yimai', 'We drove out those Almata goons for good, yeah?<br/>What better reason to go out and party?')
('Yimai', "The Blacklight District is just packed with people<br/>these days... It's a madhouse, I swear.")
('Yimai', "Some are selling, some are snooping, some are just<br/>doing whatever they darn well please. It's hard to<br/>know what's going on anymore.")
('Yimai', "It's gotten everybody a bit high strung lately.<br/>Be careful walking around—you don't wanna set<br/>anybody off.")
('Yimai', "Oof, ack... Why's my old wound giving me trouble<br/>again...?")
('Yimai', "Might just be karma. What goes around,<br/>comes around. This isn't the first time it's given me<br/>grief, and I doubt it'll be the last.")
('Yimai', 'Heiyue had their eyes on me in my youth... I had to<br/>bail from Langport, it got so bad. I miss that city...')
('Yimai', "Ohoho. Perhaps I should head over to Isabelle's and<br/>have her take a look at my old wound. Maybe there's<br/>something she can do for me.")
('Yimai', "Word on the street is, the big A's finally cooling off.<br/>It's been about two weeks since they were last around.")
('Yimai', "Maybe they're finally pulling out of Edith for good...<br/>and good riddance, I say. I can finally get back to<br/>business with them gone.")
('Yimai', 'I just remembered: there were these gangsters who<br/>came up to my shop a while ago looking for some<br/>strange antique...')
('Yimai', "Hindsight says they might've been working for A.<br/>Makes you wonder who's been pulling the strings<br/>behind all this—even I can't say for certain.")
('Yimai', "Did my eyes deceive me, or was that Beauty's Blade<br/>working with Heiyue and Ouroboros?")
('Yimai', "And those weren't the only intriguing faces<br/>present, either.")
('Yimai', "Hohoho! I shudder to think what's about to happen if<br/>all of them are putting their heads together.")
('Yimai', "Well, look who it is: Mister Arkride<br/>Solutions himself! And he's got the Immovable<br/>tagging right along with him, too...")
('Yimai', "Interesting. Veeery interesting, hohoho.<br/>Something must be going on for the two of you to be<br/>working together, but I'll mind my own business.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Hah! You sound pretty well informed, sir.<br/>Nothing gets past you, does it?')
('Yimai', "You know what they say: knowledge is power.<br/>He who knows more, controls most. That's the key to<br/>staying in the black down here.")
('Yimai', "That is to say, I trust you won't have any problems<br/>with my humble little store, Mr. Vathek?")
('Zin the Immovable', "Of course, sir—provided you don't cause any trouble<br/>for us at the guild.")
('Van', "(Sheesh, talk about an uneasy truce. I ain't stickin'<br/>MY nose in their mind games, no sir.)")
('Yimai', "I shudder to imagine what's necessitated that, but I<br/>know better than to stick my nose where it<br/>doesn't belong.")
('Yimai', "Whatever's brought you two together, I appreciate<br/>your business all the same.")
('Yimai', "Hohoho! Oh, Filenkov. Haven't you learned<br/>your lesson? Are you really about to spring for<br/>a forgery?")
('Filenkov', "Come now, don't put it like that. You know me: I<br/>don't care for authenticity or for condition.")
('Filenkov', "I care for the story behind this piece. It's still a work<br/>of art influenced by the antiques of the East.")
('Filenkov', 'It caught my eye, and so I shall buy it. Surely my<br/>old friend would understand how I operate by now?')
('Yimai', "Hohoho... Oh, you're truly one of a kind, Filenkov.<br/>Who else would shine their eyes upon such...<br/>esoteric merchandise?")
('Filenkov', 'Now, these are some interesting finds! Coming back<br/>to Edith is always worth the trip!')
('Van', '(Of all the places that old repairman could have ties<br/>to, never in a million years would I have guessed the<br/>Blacklight District.)')
('Van', "(But hey, this guy's wares are right up his alley.<br/>Maybe there's somethin' in there for me, too. I'll hit<br/>him up and see.)")
('Paprica', 'I just got a hold of Gabriella. She and her little guy<br/>Yota are both doing just fine!')
('Paprica', "You don't know how relieving it is to hear that.<br/>I wouldn't have been able to sleep if anything<br/>happened to those two.")
('Paprica', "Now that I know they're all okay, I can get back to<br/>mixing drinks and lifting spirits! C'mon, drink up!<br/>You'll thank yourself later!")
('Paprica', "I... G-Goddess above, I don't know what to do!<br/>I've never seen anything like this!")
('Paprica', 'Where are Gabriella and Yota?! I know they went up<br/>to the surface not too long ago...')
('Paprica', "I want to look for them, but... Gah, I'm just tied up<br/>down here. What do I do...?!")
('Paprica', "Why, hello, handsome! Welcome to Gabriella's<br/>watering hole!")
('Paprica', "Surprised? Gabriella's put me in charge of the place<br/>for the time being.")
('Paprica', 'She wanted to take her little guy, Yota, to the festival,<br/>and needed someone to hold down the fort.<br/>How could I say no for her kid?')
('Paprica', "She offered to pay for the trouble, so I figured,<br/>why not? It's nice doing something new for a change.")
('Paprica', "This is actually pretty fun! I've never worked in<br/>anything like a bar before. My sales figures are gonna<br/>blow her away when she gets back!")
('Paprica', "I can't go back up to the surface anymore—I've got<br/>debt collectors on my tail. So I'm just stuck down<br/>here now.")
('Paprica', "I'm just trying to make ends meet, landing whatever<br/>clients I can. It's not the WORST I could be<br/>doing, but...")
('Paprica', "...is this really how the rest of my life goes? I'm not<br/>exactly getting any younger here.")
('Paprica', "Not that there's any use worrying now. It's not like I<br/>can just snap my fingers and change the way I live<br/>this late in the game. *sigh*")
('Paprica', "We've had a lot of real nasty jaeger types around<br/>here lately. It makes it hard to focus on my job.")
('Paprica', 'Times like these really bog down my work, given I<br/>have to go out and bring in clients myself.')
('Paprica', "I've thought about joining Eden, but I dunno if I<br/>could hack it when all their other girls are so<br/>much younger... *sigh*")
('Paprica', "Little Yota's just too cute for his own good, I tell you.<br/>He makes all your worries melt away...")
('Paprica', "I think maybe my luck's starting to look up. I'm not<br/>seeing those feisty, fight-picking gangsters around<br/>here anymore, for one.")
('Paprica', "And then just today, I bagged a real VIP client!<br/>I'm so proud of myself! I love getting a real big<br/>shot, heehee. ㈱")
('Paprica', "Maybe I'll take the rest of the day off and treat myself<br/>at Gabriella's. Celebrate the good times, you know?<br/>I deserve it!")
('Paprica', 'Before I came here, I used to think the Blacklight<br/>District was the absolute rock bottom in Edith. Just a<br/>terrible place.')
('Paprica', "But living down here's changed my outlook.<br/>It's...abrasive. Weird, definitely. But you know, it's<br/>kinda comfy.")
('Paprica', "I can take on clients at my own pace, I don't have to<br/>worry about the cops... Life here is good, in its own<br/>weird way.")
('Paprica', "You just need street smarts down here—you gotta<br/>make sure you don't get tangled up with the<br/>wrong people. But hey, I can deal with that.")
('Paprica', 'Oh, I remember all of you guys. Interesting...<br/>You make for one strange group when you all come<br/>here together.')
('Paprica', "But hey, what ISN'T weird when you live in the<br/>Blacklight District? Common sense is for the<br/>surface dwellers.")
('Paprica', "Just be careful down here, folks. These parts can leap<br/>out and bite you if you don't keep an eye out.")
('Paprica', "Hey there, boys! You from out of town? Why don't<br/>you stay a while and I'll show you a good time, hmm?")
('Paprica', "Oooh, you're quite the stud. And your friend there,<br/>he's just ENORMOUS! In more ways than one,<br/>I hope. ㈱")
('Zin the Immovable', "Hah! You make a tempting offer, miss—you're a real<br/>sight for sore eyes yourself!")
('Van', "Not worth it, dude. It's a wild ride, and you don't<br/>wanna be on it.")
('Morgan', 'The only way we can navigate something calamitous<br/>like this is by joining together and combining<br/>our strength!')
('Morgan', "Any help you need, we'll hook you up—anything to<br/>ensure you win! Best of luck out there, Spriggidy-do!")
('Morgan', "Don't be shy! Step right up! I've got all the weapons,<br/>all the ammo, all the funsies you could possibly need!")
('Morgan', "Whew! I'm glad I ordered a little extra stock for<br/>the festival. Who'd have thought it'd come in handy<br/>like this?")
('Morgan', "Happy Revolution Festival! See these new grenades<br/>I've got on display? What do you think? Pretty<br/>nifty, huh?")
(15040, 'Y-Yeah. Nifty...<br/>(Were they really talking about the same<br/>weapons dealer?)')
('Morgan', "Oh, more of a knife guy, maybe? I hear you, I<br/>hear you! Right, get a load of this ripper here—it's my<br/>personal favorite!")
(15040, "(His merch is definitely the real deal, but man, why's<br/>he gotta be so upbeat about it?!)")
('Morgan', "Goodness gracious, I've got customer-os<br/>aplenty today! I'm on top of the underworld!")
('Morgan', "You two take a look around! Anything catches your<br/>peepers, I'll fill you in on the details.")
('Morgan', "Mercy, am I relieved this Almata mess is<br/>yesterday's news.")
('Morgan', 'I read all about it—they said you took down that<br/>rotten old Dantès!')
('Morgan', "And thanks to you, Blacklight's nice and<br/>peaceful again. Now I can get back to selling my<br/>shooty-stabbies for the festival and...other things!")
('Aaron', "Other things? If you're trying to joke, it's not<br/>very funny.")
('Morgan', "Oh, dear. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend. I may be<br/>jocular, but I'm no joker!")
('Morgan', "You see, jaeger types tend to wash up here around<br/>festival time when they don't have any other work.<br/>That's good news for me!")
('Agnès', 'Huh. I never thought about that before. I...guess that<br/>makes sense.')
('Feri', 'Wow, that sounds amazing! I kinda wanna see it for<br/>myself now!')
('Van', "You might wanna think twice before you go rollin'<br/>around with 'em. This place gets real rowdy once the<br/>festival rolls around.")
('Morgan', "I can just tell this year's festival is going to be a<br/>real boon. I'll have to stock up in advance so that I<br/>have everything for everyone!")
('Morgan', 'Land mines, RPGs, chainsaws, submachines...ooh,<br/>and jamming devices, too. Those have been real hot<br/>commodities lately.')
('Morgan', "It's hard getting my orders through to the<br/>manufacturers, but I simply must strike while the<br/>iron's hot!")
('Morgan', "Geez Louise, it's scary to see the kind of havoc a<br/>single group of undesirables can raise.")
('Morgan', "If the Blacklight District is this shaken up about it, I<br/>can only imagine how messy it's gotten on<br/>the surface.")
('Morgan', "I'm scared to think where all this might be headed.<br/>Hopefully it doesn't snowball into something even<br/>worse, but who knows? *sigh*")
('Morgan', "Perhaps it's time I dug out some of my<br/>rarer merchandise. Normally these don't sell so easy,<br/>but you never know.")
('Morgan', "Let's see. I've got my mines, my RPGs... What else<br/>can I put out for sale? Choices, choices...")
('Morgan', "Times like these, it's hard to predict what<br/>people want. Maybe I should put out some of my less<br/>popular items and see if I get any bites.")
('Morgan', 'I had some business to negotiate with an old friend<br/>today—and mercy, she really likes to play hardball<br/>with me.')
('Morgan', "I thought raising her daughter and moving to<br/>Crossbell might've softened her up a little, but nope!")
('Morgan', "That daughter of hers? Wouldn't you know it, she's in<br/>the arms dealing business, too! And darn tootin', she's<br/>good at it.")
('Morgan', 'Word is, she even has her own airship now! She really<br/>does take after her mother. I might have a real<br/>firecracker on my hands when she grows up...')
('Morgan', "I got that deal done, in the end...but I'm telling you,<br/>they make for one scary duo.")
('Morgan', "Whatever happened to throwing your old friend<br/>a bone? Chivalry's dead, I tell you! *sigh* Ah, well.")
('Morgan', 'Today I mosey on up to Altair for a little<br/>business negotiating.')
('Morgan', "I've gotta set the stage juuust right—that means<br/>triple-checking my schedule, arranging gifts and<br/>favors, the whole nine arge.")
('Morgan', "Maybe I should include little notes, too. New Year's<br/>IS almost here! I'm sure they'd appreciate<br/>the goodwill.")
('Quatre', "(He SOUNDS perfectly polite and thoughtful...but I<br/>don't want to even think about what he'd put on<br/>those notes.)")
('Van', "(Yeeeah, I feel sorry for the poor schmucks he's<br/>workin' with.)")
('Morgan', "Oh, I remember seeing you all pass through<br/>here earlier. I'm glad to see you managed to reunite<br/>with Mr. Van!")
('Morgan', "Just be careful where you walk! The more trouble you<br/>can avoid, the better. Blacklight's full of danger—<br/>STRANGER danger, especially!")
('Morgan', "Don't make eye contact with anybody who looks the<br/>least bit suspicious, all righty? It's for your safety.")
('Agnès', 'O-Okay. Thank you for the advice, sir.')
('Risette', 'Not to change the subject, but may I ask why you<br/>wear that mask? Its design is quite...curious.')
('Morgan', 'Oh, you mean this thing? Gee willickers, I feel so<br/>darn silly talking about it...')
('Morgan', 'Call it a little indulgence of mine. In another life, I<br/>was a little...naughty, you see. ㈱')
('Feri', "Oh. That's, uh...neat.<br/>(I guess it's just kinda his own weird little quirk?)")
('Aaron', "(Quirk, my ass. Man's creepy as all get out.)")
('Van', "(I know he's weird, but that's just the way<br/>Blacklight is. Just roll with it, 'kay?)")
('Morgan', "Watch your step when you're walking around here!<br/>The Blacklight District is full of danger—<br/>STRANGER danger, especially!")
('Morgan', 'Come back soon, all righty? Always happy to<br/>serve you!')
('Morgan', "Howdy there, Spriggidy-do! And is THAT the<br/>Immovable Mr. Zin I see? Well, butter my butt and<br/>call me a biscuit! How've you been, big guy?")
('Van', "Wait, you guys know each other? You really are a<br/>celebrity down here, ain'tcha?")
('Zin the Immovable', "I wouldn't say that. Morgan just happens to be one of<br/>the more reputable merchants here—and I do<br/>sometimes employ his services.")
('Zin the Immovable', "He kinda tiptoes the legal line, but he's been an<br/>invaluable informant for us at the guild, so we just<br/>sort of look the other way.")
('Morgan', "Oh, mercy, that's... That's so nice of you, Mr. Zin.<br/>Too nice, in fact—I haven't done that much, really.")
('Morgan', "I still feel terrible that I couldn't help you before...<br/>I'm so sorrily sorry! I'm pathetic, I tell you. Just a<br/>failure in the eyes of Aidios...")
('Van', "(Y'know, it's weird as hell seein' a guy in a mask<br/>beatin' up on himself like that. It's givin'<br/>me whiplash.)")
('Zin the Immovable', "(Hahaha! Yeah, I get that. He's an eccentric fellow,<br/>but I take it to mean he's a good guy at heart.)")
('Morgan', "Well, shut my mouth! I'm surprised to see you two<br/>boys mingling together.")
('Morgan', 'I have a whole slew of outposts scattered around<br/>Calvard—I just happen to be staying around the<br/>Blacklight District for the time being.')
('Morgan', "By all means, feel free to look around and browse<br/>my merchandise! I'm more than happy to show you<br/>all of the wonderful blessings I have! ㈱")
('Morgan', "Of course! If we can be of any use, we'll be happy<br/>to help.")
('Morgan', "I'm sure I can borrow a part or two from our<br/>cutting-edge RPGs—we'll have that covered for<br/>you lickety-split!")
('Yimai', "Don't forget about me, either. I have some black<br/>market wares that are sure to catch your eye.")
('Yimai', "They should help you procure those materials<br/>you're after. Just be warned: they don't come cheap!")
('Van', "Heh. Still hustlin', huh? Glad to see you workin'<br/>together, at least.")
('Yimai', "But of course! Why wouldn't we? All we want is a<br/>nice, peaceful marketplace for our business—and we'll<br/>do all we can to get it back.")
('Morgan', "I hear you're taking part in that big<br/>infiltration mission.")
('Morgan', "Now, being honest, I'm worried sick, but<br/>nevertheless, we'll do everything we can to help<br/>you out! Goddess bless you!")
('Agnès', "Thank you, Morgan. We'll put this all to rest,<br/>we promise!")
('Morgan', "Oh, thank Aidios! You're all okay!")
('Van', "Hey there. You two look like you're in pretty<br/>good spirits.")
('Yimai', 'Well, it helps that the Blacklight District seems to be<br/>weathering the storm better than the surface.')
('Yimai', "Whether it's the physical distance or the...cultural<br/>distance, I couldn't tell you—but I'll take<br/>it, nonetheless.")
('Yimai', 'Or is it perhaps my special evil-warding amulets?<br/>Yes, I can feel their power! Why not buy one for<br/>yourselves, hmm?')
('Morgan', "Oh, that reminds me! I have this chainsaw with quite<br/>the 'history' to it—they say it can rip and tear evil<br/>spirits in two! Let me go find it...")
('Aaron', "Nothing rains on these guys' parade, does it?")
('Bergard', "A steady hand is exactly what you want in your<br/>supplier—takes out all the guesswork. Let's stock up<br/>here while we still can.")
('Gabriella', "I'm not really doing anything for the festival. I mean,<br/>I'm not Calvardian—and even if I were, this isn't<br/>exactly the most festive block in town.")
('Gabriella', 'But everybody else is going on about it, of course.<br/>I figure I oughta let Yota walk around if he wants to.')
('Gabriella', "I do want to show him what the surface is like...<br/>The real world, so to speak. He's still got a shot at<br/>staying on the straight and narrow.")
('Gabriella', "Only problem is the bar... It's not gonna run itself<br/>while I'm gone.")
('Gabriella', "We've got jaegers everywhere trying to make moves<br/>with all the turmoil going on.")
('Gabriella', "However it all shakes out, I can't see it leading to<br/>anything good. *sigh*")
('Gabriella', 'Tell me: was that reporter who I think it was?<br/>The one who broke the news about Creil Village...?')
('Agnès', '*sniffle*')
('Van', 'I...think you know the answer as well as we do.')
('Gabriella', '...Man, shit. He was a good guy.')
('Gabriella', "I feel like it's our responsibility to go out and<br/>avenge him... That way he can rest in peace up there.")
('Gabriella', "I'd do it myself, but...yeah. All I can do is pour one<br/>out for him.")
('Gabriella', "Not to mention, we've got jaeger corps making moves<br/>all over the place. Shit could get ugly any second.")
('Gabriella', "*sigh* I probably need to put more stock in<br/>maintaining my weapons—not just for my safety, but<br/>Yota's, too.")
('Gabriella', "...I'm not his birth mother, I should clarify. I found<br/>him on a battlefield I was working in.")
('Gabriella', "He's not tough by any stretch, though. He's so frail, I<br/>feel like if I let go of him, he'll just blow into dust.")
('Gabriella', "But you know something? I don't feel like I'm the one<br/>protecting him... The opposite, actually: he's the one<br/>who saved me.")
('Gabriella', 'I was a cold and heartless woman before I<br/>found him... He taught me what it meant to<br/>love someone.')
('Gabriella', "There's nothing I want more than for him to grow up<br/>happy, healthy, and strong... I want to give him the<br/>life he deserves.")
('Gabriella', 'I hope and pray my little Yota grows up to be big and<br/>strong, and that he gets to feel the sun on his face.<br/>Easier said than done, but...still.')
('Gabriella', "I was a Northern Jaeger in another life. That's the<br/>only reason I have any connections at all.")
('Gabriella', "But I'm done with that business now. I only hear the<br/>occasional whisper from my friends in those circles.")
('Dingo', "That's still valuable intel regardless—and it's good<br/>that you're sharing it. I try to do the same with my<br/>info so that we all benefit.")
('Gabriella', "Which I appreciate. You don't try to leech off of me<br/>like some other men do.")
('Gabriella', "Any rate, there's no going back to where I came from.<br/>This is my home—I gotta just find a way to hack it<br/>down here.")
('Van', "(I heard her mention the Northern Jaegers—that<br/>must mean she's North Ambrian. That place is still<br/>real poor for...obvious reasons.)")
('Van', "(They finally broke off from Erebonia last year, but<br/>they ain't exactly had it easy since then.)")
('Gabriella', "My hands are too dirty after all these years. A gal like<br/>me doesn't belong on the surface.")
('Gabriella', "And I couldn't go back to the Northern Jaegers, even<br/>if I wanted to—they all broke up. Just gotta lie low<br/>and make it work down here.")
('Gabriella', "I can't just think for myself anymore, anyway...<br/>Gotta take care of Yota, too.")
('Gabriella', "(*sigh* Yota, how are you always SO cute?<br/>You're always such a sweet, considerate little angel. ㈱)")
('Gabriella', "...The hell're you looking at? Can't you give a gal<br/>some privacy?! You're killin' the goddamn vibe!")
('Agnès', "Sorry, sorry! We'll be out of your way.<br/>(She was in a completely different world there.)")
('Aaron', "(Yeah, talk about zoning out. She sure as hell doesn't<br/>look all bark, though.)")
('Feri', "(I kinda feel like she used to be a jaeger. Maybe<br/>she's retired.)")
('Feri', '(Either way, she really loves her son. Heehee.)')
('Gabriella', "Just so we're absolutely clear: if you do anything to my<br/>Yota—and I do mean ANYTHING—you're going<br/>to pay the price for it. Big time.")
('Gabriella', "If you're gonna drink at my bar, I expect you to know<br/>your place. Got it?!")
('Gabriella', '...You serious? Zin Vathek?! What the hell are YOU<br/>doing here?')
('Gabriella', "Look, if you're just a customer, that's fine. But you're<br/>on our turf, and we're not the straight laces you deal<br/>with on the surface.")
('Gabriella', "You just stay the hell out of our business and we'll<br/>steer clear of yours. You got that?")
('Zin the Immovable', "Don't worry, I know my place here. I'm not looking<br/>to ruffle any feathers.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Sometimes all I want is to shoot the shit over drinks.<br/>Nothing wrong with that, is there?')
('Gabriella', "No, provided you don't try to pull anything funny.<br/>And drop the goody-two-shoes bullshit while you're<br/>here, okay? Makes me wanna puke.")
('Zin the Immovable', "I hear you, I'll be careful. Thanks for the warning.<br/>(She must be some kind of ex-jaeger to be talking<br/>like that.)")
('Van', "(Best you don't go down that rabbit hole.<br/>People don't like you pryin' into their histories here.)")
('Van', "(And anyway, pretty sure this ain't the bar we want.)")
('Gabriella', "Bracers make me sick just looking at them—<br/>always have. I sure as hell don't miss that part of<br/>the surface.")
('Gabriella', "Bunch'a hypocrites who don't know jack shit about<br/>how the world works. They're not mafia bad, but<br/>that's not exactly a high bar.")
('Gabriella', "Just stay in your damn lane. This is OUR world. You<br/>wannabe cops and your shiny badges don't mean shit<br/>down here, so get lost.")
('Gabriella', "And ANYBODY who tries laying a finger on my<br/>Yota, bracer or not, they'll have hell to pay.<br/>REAL hell. Remember that if you want to live.")
('Dingo', "Damn. Not a peep from your channels, huh?<br/>That's pretty surprising.")
('Gabriella', "Sorry about that... All I can tell you is that it's not<br/>coming from Messeldam.")
('Gabriella', "I don't know what specifically you're trying to dig up,<br/>but if you're gonna try and find some other<br/>informants yourself, you'd better be careful—")
('Gabriella', 'Oh. Hey there, spriggan.')
('Dingo', "Hey, Van. Didn't know you guys were down here.")
('Dingo', 'Doing a little onboarding for your latest hire,<br/>looks like?')
('Van', "Kinda, though he's just a temp.")
('Quatre', "Pleased to meet you, Mr. Brad—my name is<br/>Quatre Salision. I've heard plenty about you from<br/>my colleagues.")
('Quatre', "From what I gather, you've lent your talents to both<br/>the Institute of Science and the Verne Company on<br/>several occasions.")
('Dingo', 'Yeah, I exchange intel for their inside scoops every<br/>now and then. I scratch their back, they scratch mine.')
('Dingo', "So wait... You're the kid that Hamilton...")
('Quatre', 'Hmm? Is...something the matter?')
('Van', "What's up? Got word from the grapevine about him?")
('Dingo', "No, not exactly. He just reminded me of an old scoop<br/>I'd forgotten about.")
('Dingo', "At any rate, I heard you pulled your own weight out<br/>there in Basel. That's real impressive for a kid<br/>your age.")
('Dingo', "If you can already hang with Van and his ragtag<br/>bunch, you'll do just fine at the solutions office.")
('Quatre', "Th-Thank you! I, er... Of course. I'll pour my all into<br/>my work here.")
('Quatre', "(I'd heard he was handsome, but seeing him in person<br/>is...really something else.)")
('Feri', '(Yeah, he looks really cool and rugged. Heehee.)')
('Aaron', "(Meh. As a real ladykiller, I'd give him maybe a seven<br/>out of ten. Better than the boss, though, I'll give him<br/>that much.)")
('Risette', '(I can see why Mr. Arkride and Ms. Aymé place<br/>their trust in him.)')
('Agnès', "(Ahaha... I think you're<br/>perfectly handsome, too, Van!)")
('Van', "(It's all right, Agnès. You don't have to try and pity<br/>this poor, ugly old geezer. He's just too far gone...)")
('Van', "How 'bout you, though? Out investigatin' something?<br/>I know you ran out on your date with your little<br/>gal pal.")
('Dingo', "Oh, you ran into Marielle, did you? Yeah, I had to<br/>scram—although I did recommend she hit the<br/>bathhouse, so her time out wasn't a total wash.")
('Van', "How 'bout you, though? Out investigatin' something?<br/>Not used to seein' you 'round here at this time of day.")
('Dingo', "Yeah. I have to keep my schedule open—I've got<br/>something lined up tonight. So I'm just schmoozing<br/>here for now.")
('Dingo', '...')
('Van', "...What's up? Sounded like you had more to say.")
('Agnès', 'Is...everything okay?')
('Dingo', "Sorry. Just lost in thought. I'm following a lead at the<br/>moment—nothing solid yet, but yeah.")
('Dingo', "I might actually have to hit you up later, if that's okay.<br/>You might know a thing or two about it.")
('Van', "Fine with me. You know my door's always open<br/>for you.")
('Van', "Havin' a guy like you in my line of work is a real<br/>cheat code. I'll always lend you a hand.")
('Agnès', "Agreed. Please, don't hesitate to come talk to us,<br/>especially now that we have extra hands to help.")
('Dingo', "Thanks. I'll let you guys know if I end up needing<br/>outside help on it.")
('Yota', "Hey, what's a...uh, a rebelooshun festibull?<br/>Mommy and the others keep talking about it.")
('Yota', 'Is it like a...a celery? Cell abrasion? One of those.<br/>I went to one with Mommy at the colosseum. Is this<br/>one like that?')
('Yota', "Mommy asked if I wanna go, but I dunno if I wanna,<br/>'cause like...")
('Yota', '...I dunno what a rebelooshun festibull is.')
('Yota', "But I bet it's great! I get to be with Mommy, and<br/>being with Mommy makes me super duper ultra<br/>extra happy! Heehee!")
('Yota', 'A lot of old guys like to come here for some reason.')
('Yota', "I dunno who they are. Maybe they just like<br/>Mommy's drinks?")
('Yota', "I like them, though! Nobody who likes Mommy's<br/>drinks can be a bad person! Heehee, I'm gonna go<br/>give them all biiig hugs!")
('Yota', "Mommyyy... Lemme help... I'll wash the...<br/>the dishes... *yaaawn*")
('Gabriella', "Thank you, Yota, but that's okay. It's time for you to<br/>go to bed now.")
('Gabriella', 'Mommy can take care of everything by herself.<br/>Go brush your teeth and get tucked in, okay?')
('Yota', 'Mommyyy... Can you pick me up...?')
('Gabriella', '*sigh* Now how am I supposed to say no to that?')
('Gabriella', "Okay, but only after you've brushed your teeth.<br/>Come on, let's go. I'll wait for you while you get ready<br/>for bed.")
('Yota', "Huh? Who are you, lady? I've never seen you before!")
('Quatre', "Lady? A-Are you talking about me? E-Er, no, I'm<br/>a guy!")
('Yota', "Really? You're so prettyyy! I thought you were a lady.")
('Yota', "That's okay! Hey, will you hug me and pick me up?<br/>Pleeease?")
('Quatre', "Er, sorry, I'll have to pass!")
('Quatre', "(This place just gets weirder and weirder...<br/>You'd think this kid would've learned to be more<br/>careful around strangers.)")
('Agnès', "(Heehee, he's really taken a liking to you, hasn't he?<br/>That's so sweet.)")
('Yota', 'Mr. Dingo knows so many cool stories!')
('Yota', "I wanna be just like him when I grow up! I'm gonna<br/>travel all over the world and meet a ton of people!")
('Yota', "And I'm gonna give everybody big old hugs! ㈱")
('Yota', "Hey, you're the curry-her lady!")
('Yota', 'Yaaay! Are you gonna tell me more stories about<br/>the outside? Pleeease?')
('Hermès', 'Of course! What are you curious about today, kiddo?')
('Yota', 'Hmm... Oh, oh! I wanna know about where Mommy<br/>came from! And can you gimme a hug, too?')
('Hermès', "*sigh* Just an irresistible little munchkin, aren't you?<br/>Oh, all right. C'mere, I'm all yours.")
('Van', '(Hah. Even Hermès is no match for the power<br/>of cuteness.)')
('Yota', 'Heehee! I LOVE the curry-her lady!')
('Yota', 'Sometimes she comes to visit me! I wish she would<br/>come every day!')
('Zin the Immovable', "Whoa, hey there, little guy. Didn't see you there.")
('Yota', "WHOA! You're so BIG, mister!")
('Yota', "You should have some of Mommy's drinks!<br/>They're delicious!")
('Yota', "I'm not allowed to have any 'cause I'm too little.<br/>But you guys will love them! I know it!")
('Zin the Immovable', "Sounds like a ringing endorsement to me. I'll never<br/>say no to a good glass of brew.")
('Yota', "Really?! You're gonna have one of<br/>Mommy's 'spear-its'? You promise?!")
('Zin the Immovable', "You bet. I'm a little too busy to sit down for a drink<br/>today, but I'll come back another day for it. Deal?")
('Yota', "Yaaay! I'm gonna tell Mommy right now!")
('Zin the Immovable', "(Whoops, might've run my mouth a bit too<br/>much there. That kid got me hook, line, and sinker.)")
('Van', "(I'll say. No wonder this joint does pretty well<br/>for itself.)")
('Yota', "You're so BIG, mister! You're like a bear!")
('Yota', "Heehee! Hey, mister, won't you come back to play<br/>another day? I'll be waiting!")
('Zin the Immovable', "Well, how can I say no to a face like that? You've got<br/>a deal, kiddo: I'll come back soon, okay?")
('Beckson', 'Need a bite to eat? I just had a ton of people telling<br/>me they were hungry, so I decided to open back<br/>up for now.')
('Beckson', 'Guess we folks adjust to things pretty quickly, for<br/>better and for worse.')
('Beckson', "I ain't made of booze and grub, though. I only got so<br/>much to go around.")
('Beckson', "You guys better come back in one piece, y'hear me?<br/>My business is countin' on you!")
('Beckson', "Hey, good, you're alive. That makes two of us.<br/>We're doing just peachy down here, for the most part.")
('Beckson', "No idea what these devils are. If they're customers, I'll<br/>serve 'em like anyone else. Shitheels? I'll beat their<br/>asses like anyone else.")
('Beckson', "I dunno what's up with those guys frozen in place<br/>there...but they better not try'n dine and dash me,<br/>or else.")
('Feri', "(Wow, he's really giving them the glare! I feel sorry<br/>for them.)")
('Van', "(Well, least he's got the place on lock. You can always<br/>count on him for that.)")
('Beckson', "Damn, I've got Salvatore Gotti himself in the house.")
('Beckson', "I ain't the type of guy to get very hands-on with<br/>my customers. But someone like him, I gotta make<br/>sure we treat him right.")
('Beckson', "Why's that, you ask...? You really don't know?<br/>You dense or somethin'?")
('Beckson', "'Cause Gotti's films are the shit down here, just like<br/>everywhere else! We ain't some other dimension.")
('Beckson', "I recognize some of the guys he's got with him, too.<br/>Whatever they're doin', they look like they're in<br/>good spirits.")
('Beckson', "Heh. Think I'mma go out on a limb and offer 'em<br/>somethin' special for liftin' our spirits here in<br/>this dump.")
('Beckson', 'Every festival, the colosseum down here holds a<br/>tournament called the Apex Showdown.')
('Beckson', "It's a hell of a hoot. They kick it off with this monster<br/>bloodbath, all kinds of different creatures goin' at<br/>each other.")
('Beckson', "Pretty thrillin' stuff, and it makes for as good an<br/>excuse to gamble as any. You should check it out if<br/>you're into that kinda thing.")
('Beckson', "This place is a real magnet for the thugs and lowlifes<br/>of Calvard. Talkin' jaeger dropouts, con artists,<br/>two-bit gangsters, the works.")
('Beckson', "Those guys are always makin' a ruckus. I tell 'em to<br/>can it, but the dumb shits never listen.")
('Beckson', "You folks be real careful wanderin' around these parts.<br/>Damn near anything can pop off if your luck's<br/>bad enough.")
('Beckson', "Ain't nobody knows exactly how long Blacklight's<br/>been around.")
('Beckson', "You believe the people on the streets, they'll tell you it<br/>goes back some 500 years.")
('Beckson', "More likely, it just popped up when people were<br/>driftin' around the city after the revolution. Shit was<br/>real chaotic back then.")
('Beckson', "Only one who knows for sure's probably the boss, and<br/>the boss ain't someone to show up down here often,<br/>so who can say for certain?")
('Beckson', "The boss is the one who keeps things clean<br/>down here. Ain't a soul alive down here who don't<br/>benefit somehow.")
('Beckson', "I don't see the boss all that often myself, but you can<br/>always count on him to come through when you<br/>need him.")
('Beckson', "Well, I'll be damned, spriggan. Word on the street's<br/>that you folks tussled with Almata's crew out in Basel.")
('Beckson', "Heh, don't you play coy with me. You got the<br/>underworld talkin'. Heard even Marduk had to get<br/>their hands dirty.")
('Beckson', "Hope you realize what kind of hornets' nest you've<br/>gone and shook. You ain't careful, you'll have a<br/>one-way ticket to an early grave.")
('Beckson', "Well, look what the cat dragged in.<br/>Thought'cha could start shit outside my<br/>restaurant, huh?")
('Beckson', "I'll let you guys off once—got to make some money<br/>takin' bets on that. But you damage this place and I'll<br/>collect on your head, got it?")
('Beckson', "Don't you guys cause no trouble, all right? This here's<br/>a legit business I'm runnin' with the boss' permission.<br/>You can't gimme shit!")
('Agnès', "('Legitimate' is...stretching it a bit, with all those<br/>safety hazards he's got in plain sight.)")
('Feri', "(Whatever's going on, he sounds serious! Better not<br/>get in his way or else.)")
('Van', "(It ain't MY fault all that crap went down...<br/>Eh, whatever. Let's take a look around and then get<br/>the hell outta here.)")
('Aaron', "(Relax, chief! Why do we need to rush? The gambling<br/>den's open. We oughta grab a seat and throw down.<br/>We can leave once we make some dough.)")
('Van', '(...All right, but just a little. And I mean ONLY<br/>a little.)')
('Beckson', "We run a gamblin' den here, but that don't mean it's<br/>a free-for-all. Any bastards that step outta line get<br/>kicked out. Literally.")
('Beckson', 'You wanna up the ante and put more money on the<br/>table, be my guest. But when you play in my house,<br/>you play by my rules.')
('Beckson', "The sooner you get that through your thick skulls, the<br/>better we'll get along. Got it?")
('Maron', 'Hey there! Come on and have some fun!')
('Maron', "Just don't get TOO naughty, all right? ㈱")
('Magisa', "I hear you youngins are startin' some big operation.")
('Magisa', "Now there's a show I don't want to miss! I'll have to<br/>go watch and get some hecklin' in, heehee.")
('Magisa', "Exciting as this all is, I have to admit, it's gonna get<br/>in the way of my work if it goes on much longer.")
('Magisa', "Don't let me down now, kids! You kick the bucket<br/>and you won't hear the end of it from<br/>me, understand? Wahaha!")
('Magisa', "(Tch... I can shake off your run-of-the-mill monster<br/>like it's nobody's business, but this one's awful<br/>stubborn here.)")
('Magisa', "(And all these people fleein' behind me don't give me<br/>any room to work with. Gah, this is just ridiculous!)")
('Magisa', "Gah, criminy. That racist coot's goin' on one of his<br/>rants again. Does he EVER shut up?")
('Magisa', 'I just might have a word with that man later.<br/>Everybody can appreciate a useful idiot, if you catch<br/>my drift.')
('Magisa', "I can tell just by lookin' at him: poke him in the right<br/>place and he falls like a house of cards. Bet I can<br/>sucker him just like that.")
('Magisa', "The government's been awful slow responding to the<br/>mafia's massacre. And the guild's got their hands<br/>tied, too...")
('Magisa', "Heehee! Oh, man, I haven't felt so thrilled in ages!")
('Magisa', "Who makes the next move, I wonder? Maybe there'll<br/>be some blood to pay?")
('Magisa', "Whatever happens, it's settin' up for one hell of<br/>a show! I'm on pins and needles!")
('Magisa', 'Has it really been a whole year since Crossbell broke<br/>off from Erebonia? How time flies when you get to<br/>my age...')
('Magisa', "I had a number of brushes with the ol' CPD back<br/>when I lived there.")
('Magisa', "They'll throw you in jail for just about anything over<br/>there—I didn't even do anything wrong this one<br/>time, and they still cuffed me.")
('Magisa', "But if they think they got the last laugh, oh, they've<br/>got another thing comin'. One of these days, they'll<br/>pay the piper. ㈱")
('Magisa', "Crossbell's startin' to get a little big for its britches<br/>now that it's independent. They've got consulates and<br/>everything now.")
('Magisa', "But if the cops and the SSS think they've had the last<br/>laugh, oh, they've got another thing comin'.<br/>Sooner or later, they'll pay the piper. ㈱")
('Magisa', 'In a previous life of mine, I used to sell all kinds<br/>of stuff.')
('Magisa', "Money was good, job was easy, and nothin' felt better<br/>than swindlin' whatever poor bastard walked into<br/>my shop.")
('Magisa', "I've been on somethin' of a hiatus from all that, but<br/>I'd just LOVE to get back into the swing of things<br/>given the chance.")
('Magisa', 'Now that was some good entertainment today!<br/>Sure made this old hag happy.')
('Magisa', "They've got some pretty colorful youngins lined up.<br/>I can't wait to see just what sort of havoc they end<br/>up wreakin'. ㈱")
('Aaron', '(Heh. Not your average grandma, this one.)')
('Feri', "(She gives off a really sinister aura... I'm not<br/>sure why.)")
('Magisa', "Blacklight ain't without it's downsides—but when<br/>you're old and you've got more time than you know<br/>what to do with, it's the only place to be.")
('Magisa', "Just don't call it my retirement, because I've still got<br/>plenty of fuel left in this tank! Hahaha!")
('Mistress', "Now that I'm finally back in contact with people, I've<br/>got a good grasp of what's going on.")
('Mistress', "In hindsight, I really wrote off Almata. It's clear as<br/>day now that they're not your average thugs.")
('Mistress', "Your ordinary mafia wouldn't be out causing all<br/>of...this. These people just... I don't even know how<br/>to describe them.")
('Mistress', "That's just what I keep going back to at this point.")
('Mistress', "I'm guessing you're all taking part in that<br/>big operation? Well, go get 'em, tiger. I'm rooting<br/>for you.")
('Mistress', "When this is all over, we'll make sure to treat you<br/>right down here.")
('Mistress', "So make sure you come back alive, got it?<br/>There's nothing sexy about a dead hero!")
('Mistress', "My staff's real skittish with everything going on, so I<br/>hired some extra hands to bolster our security.")
('Mistress', 'That ought to help keep things under control<br/>around here. If only we could help those girls frozen<br/>in place, though...')
('Mistress', "*sigh* I just can't believe those guys would go this far.<br/>You guys be careful out there, all right? Seriously.")
('Mistress', "Well, don't you two look awfully friendly together on<br/>this festival day?")
('Mistress', "Well, that's all right. We accept all kinds here—we're<br/>a judgment-free zone.")
('Agnès', "Wh-WHAT?! Wait, no! You've got it all wrong!<br/>Van and I, we're not—")
('Feri', "'Kinds'? 'All kinds' of what? I don't get it.")
('Aaron', "Huh? Look, I know I'm a hot commodity, but I don't<br/>lend myself to just ANYONE—least of all this old<br/>fart here.")
('Risette', "Heehee... Well, no. Mr. Arkride and I maintain a<br/>professional relationship. It isn't what you seem to<br/>think it is.")
('Quatre', "E-Excuse me?! What are you even saying?! I've never<br/>heard anything more outrageous in my life!")
('Judith', 'I... Beg pardon?! Wh-Why do you think he and I<br/>would ever... Gah, no! Absolutely not!')
('Bergard', 'Oh? What sort of activities did you have in mind?<br/>Training, perhaps?')
('Mistress', '...')
('Mistress', "...Oh. Well, uh, point taken. I might've read the<br/>room a bit wrong. You can't fault me in this line of<br/>work, though.")
('Van', 'Ugh, lay off me already. You always have such a<br/>one-track mind.')
('Mistress', "Heehee! Well, if you know, why'd you seek me out?<br/>Fool you twice, shame on you, right?")
('Mistress', 'Oh, yeah. I wanted to mention... Thanks for getting<br/>revenge for Dingo.')
('Mistress', "He and I went way back. What happened to him just<br/>didn't sit right with me at all.")
('Mistress', "I'm glad he got what he wanted in the end. Now we<br/>can all rest easy going into the festival...and wherever<br/>he is, I'm sure he can, too.")
('Van', 'You can say that again.')
('Van', "(Man, even dead, that guy's got women pinin'<br/>for him. Guess that's just how big an effect he had<br/>on everybody.)")
('Mistress', 'Dingo was always going after Almata. I imagine deep<br/>down, he was always prepared to pay the price...')
('Mistress', 'He was really willing to put it all on the line to bring<br/>them to justice. He never said a word about any of it<br/>to me, though.')
('Mistress', "Either way, I'm glad you guys were able to fulfill his<br/>last wishes. As a friend of his, thank you all from the<br/>bottom of my heart.")
('Van', "Hey. Just wanted to let you know that we found the<br/>notebook we were lookin' for. Thanks for your help<br/>back there.")
('Mistress', "Oh, wow. You found it, huh? Good... I'm sure he's<br/>glad to see it's in safe hands, too.")
('Mistress', "I wasn't able to get together with him all that much<br/>after our careers took off. I loved shooting the breeze<br/>over drinks with him...")
('Mistress', "Had I known this would happen, I would've made<br/>more time for him... It is what it is, though.<br/>Nothing I can do about it now.")
('Mistress', 'All I can do is cherish those little connections he<br/>left behind.')
('Mistress', "I'm only the woman I am today because Dingo stuck<br/>his neck out for me.")
('Mistress', "Edith's gonna feel a little lonelier without him<br/>around, that's for sure...")
('Mistress', "But there's a lot he gave us both while he was<br/>still alive. It's up to us to make sure they all last.")
('Mistress', 'He probably entrusted the notebook to someone he<br/>was close with...')
('Mistress', 'Going off your description, a taxi driver would<br/>probably fit the bill. I can see him being friends<br/>with one.')
('Mistress', 'Good luck. I hope you find the notebook, for<br/>his sake.')
('Mistress', "I'm sure that if he wanted anyone to have it, it would<br/>be you guys.")
('Mistress', "You won't hear me complaining about Almata<br/>getting the boot...but we've got tons and tons of<br/>festival goers trundling around in their place now.")
('Mistress', "It really isn't the best for business when rowdy types<br/>come along... Hopefully they mind their business.")
('Mistress', "But there are so many deterrents in play now, maybe I<br/>won't have anything to worry about. Who can say?")
('Mistress', 'I never thought Almata would go that far...but<br/>they did. They sure as hell did...')
('Mistress', 'I had a couple friends out there, and now... *sigh* All<br/>you can do is just try and roll with the punches,<br/>I guess.')
('Mistress', "What psychotic stunt do they pull next, though?<br/>Nothing's off the table anymore...")
('Mistress', "Well, this is unusual. What's the occasion? You pop<br/>down here for pleasure over business for a change?")
('Van', "Nah, I'm good. Just figure it's a good idea to keep<br/>tabs on this place every now and then. Never know<br/>when you might find somethin' useful.")
('Van', "Been noticin' some faces I didn't see during the day.<br/>Looks like you guys're havin' some interesting visitors<br/>'round here, too.")
('Mistress', "Oh, you mean 'her' and those so-called superheroes?<br/>You bet they're interesting. I've heard my fair share<br/>about them from the grapevine.")
('Mistress', "I don't mind them—we could use a little excitement.<br/>It distracts from how lonely things can get down here.")
('Van', "Y'know, 'lonely' hits different comin' from you, heh.")
('Van', '(I get her, though. You kinda gotta be a lone wolf to<br/>hack it down here.)')
('Mistress', "When the sun goes down, all the boys come out<br/>to play... That's when 'business' really picks up.")
('Mistress', 'What do you say, handsome? Any chance I can<br/>convince you to drop by this evening?')
('Mistress', "To think it's been eight years since I pretty much<br/>washed up here... Time really flies, doesn't it?")
('Mistress', "I broke my back getting this far, but now I've got all<br/>this to show for it—I can count on my harem to get<br/>the job done.")
('Mistress', "They're what keep me around, heehee. I can't bring<br/>myself to retire from this business when I've still got<br/>all of them.")
('Mistress', 'And how could I ever forget Tracey? That man lives<br/>for his job. I can trust him with just about anything.')
('Mistress', "He's reeled in some fine customers in his time—and<br/>that motivates me to keep this place spick and span so<br/>they all walk away satisfied.")
('Mistress', "Well, if it isn't Edith's one and only spriggan!<br/>What brings you here, darling? Got time to stay<br/>and play?")
('Mistress', "Your lady friends are more than welcome to join you,<br/>if they're up for it. We've got girls that know how to<br/>keep a woman company, too.")
('Mistress', "You'll be drowning in pleasures you can't find<br/>anywhere up on the surface, I can promise you that.<br/>Stay a while, won't you, big guy?")
('Feri', "Umm, I don't get it. What kind of place is this?")
('Agnès', "It feels...alluring. I feel drawn to it, but I really don't<br/>know why. I've never felt like this before...")
('Van', "Hard no. Letting you two waltz in there's just askin'<br/>for trouble.")
('Van', "...And YOU, don't even think about sneakin' inside<br/>while I'm not lookin', punk!")
('Aaron', "I'm an adult. What do you care how I spend my<br/>free time? Sometimes a guy needs to just let it hang,<br/>you know?")
('Van', "I care because you'll get hooked on that shit in<br/>two seconds. Can't trust your horny ass to stay<br/>outta trouble.")
('Mistress', "Heehee... I think most of the girls still have some<br/>growing up to do. Those services aside, I've still got<br/>some things for sale here.")
('Mistress', "If you change your mind and decide to spend some<br/>quality time with our girls, just let me know. I'll wait<br/>right here for you, handsome.")
('Risette', '(It appears she and Mr. Arkride are acquainted with<br/>one another. Whoever she is, she certainly has quite<br/>the way with words.)')
('Mistress', 'Now, we have something of a reputation for sucking<br/>our customers dry, literally and figuratively...but we<br/>still have our standards.')
('Mistress', "For one thing, we only put the squeeze on our<br/>richest customers. We don't overwork our<br/>employees either.")
('Mistress', 'Getting addicted only leads to trouble in the<br/>long term. Indulge responsibly, okay?')
('Feri', '(Huh. I dunno how to describe it, but this lady is...<br/>really alluring for some reason.)')
('Agnès', "(I know what you mean. She's beautiful...)")
('Van', '(Yeah, she has her fans on both sides of the aisle.<br/>Probably how she can recruit all those girls for<br/>the place.)')
('Barker Tracey', "Hard times these may be, but that's no reason for us<br/>to close! I've got girls looking after the jaegers and<br/>everybody else shacking up here.")
('Barker Tracey', "And wouldn't you know it, they've all perked right<br/>back up! Definitely made the right call with that one.")
('Barker Tracey', "If you folks need to recharge yourselves, we'd love to<br/>have you. After all, we'll only get through this if we all<br/>come together!")
('Aaron', 'Oh, hell yeah! That sounds tight. Count me—')
('Agnès', 'Aaron? Did you forget we have a job to do?<br/>Hmm?')
('Van', "(Damn, girl ain't messing around. She really put her<br/>foot down.)")
('Barker Tracey', "Things are real crazy down here right now. We've got<br/>people flooding in from the surface trying to flee<br/>the carnage!")
('Barker Tracey', "Everyone's probably scared out of their minds...which<br/>is exactly where we come in! We gotta keep the good<br/>times rolling!")
(15209, "Y-Yeah, you're right! We have to keep on<br/>keeping on.")
(15210, "And nothing's more comforting than the warm, soft<br/>embrace of a pretty lady.")
('Barker Tracey', "We've got things under control over here! I'll keep<br/>our spirits high no matter what it takes!")
('Barker Tracey', "You guys be careful out there—and don't<br/>be strangers! I want to see you here again when this is<br/>all over, got it?")
('Barker Tracey', "I'm the one who roped this guy in! He's the head of<br/>some big company, but he just can't get enough of<br/>this place!")
('Barker Tracey', 'Every week, he slips through the cracks of his<br/>upper-crust life just to see me... Oooh, it gives<br/>me chills!')
('Barker Tracey', "Our aphrodisiacs are selling like hotcakes, too! It's a<br/>good time to be in Zemuria's oldest business, let me<br/>tell you!")
('Barker Tracey', "Even the Blacklight District's all thrown out<br/>of whack. This whole mess is causing problems<br/>for everyone...")
('Barker Tracey', "...which means it's up to us to bounce back and get<br/>everybody back in action!")
('Barker Tracey', "That's it! I'm telling our girls to go all out! No<br/>holds barred! You guys had better come in, too—it's<br/>gonna be a real party in here!")
('Barker Tracey', 'And you there! Girlie! Get over here and help me<br/>bring in some foot traffic!')
('Mistress', 'Good to see you again tonight. Whatever you do<br/>down here, just watch out for cops.')
('Barker Tracey', "Getting tangled up with those crooks is a<br/>rookie mistake. Anyway, I'm off to go bag us a<br/>big spender! Talk to you later!")
('Barker Tracey', "Let me tell you: our girls here have THE best hips<br/>you've ever seen, guaranteed!")
('Barker Tracey', "They know how to buck and twist 'em juuust right—<br/>and the sounds that they make with those silky<br/>smooth voices of theirs... Mm-MM!")
('Barker Tracey', "Now, doesn't that just sound steamy? Come on in<br/>and take a look! We're always happy to give you a<br/>little taste of what our girls can do!")
('Barker Tracey', 'My man! You came at the perfect time! Come on,<br/>step inside and have some fun—bring your lady<br/>friends, too!')
('Barker Tracey', "You're gonna love the girls we have here! Plenty to<br/>choose from, and they're ALL people pleasers—in<br/>more ways than one.")
('Barker Tracey', "Anyhow, enjoy your stay in the Blacklight District!<br/>There's nowhere else in Edith that can tend to your<br/>deepest wants and needs like we can!")
('Van', "(I've seen that guy around here from time to time.<br/>Never knew he was a barker till now.)")
('Van', "(This joint makes sense—the cops don't come<br/>down here. If you wanna do the dirty on the<br/>down-low, this is where you go.)")
('Well-Dressed Man', 'A-Ahem! I assume that one girl is around, yes?<br/>You know the one. Once I found the time, I<br/>came running.')
('Well-Dressed Man', 'I want an hour with... No, two hours! And if you<br/>could put me at the front of the line, I would really,<br/>REALLY appreciate it.')
('Barker Tracey', "Yes we can, Mr. President! She's been waiting for you<br/>with bated breath!")
('Barker Tracey', "Can I also interest you in a bottle of our aphrodisiac?<br/>You won't have a hard time having a hard time, if you<br/>catch my drift!")
('Well-Dressed Man', "*gulp* I... Well, yes, you're right, that would be nice.<br/>I'll... I'll take two.")
('Well-Dressed Man', "Oh, Goddess help me, I'm starting to drool. I'm just<br/>too excited to see her!")
('Well-Dressed Man', "That's why I can't stop visiting this place! It gives me<br/>everything I need and more!")
('Candy', 'Hey, guess what? The boss just passed through and<br/>told me to quit fooling around and get back to work!')
('Candy', "The boss sure can crack the whip at times, heehee.<br/>But I take it as a compliment, you know? It means<br/>he's noticing our work!")
('Candy', "So hey, if he's working hard right now, so should I!<br/>Time to mix my dumb little butt off!")
('Candy', "The boss took off after that, but it's nice to know<br/>he appreciates our work! Oooh, I'm just so flattered!")
('Candy', "So hey, if he's working hard right now, so should I!<br/>Time to mix my dumb little butt off!")
('Candy', "Hey, what's the deal with those guys over there?<br/>Do you have any idea?")
('Candy', "Wait, is that supposed to be, like...some kind of<br/>street performance? Whoa, that's so cool! I wish I was<br/>that talented!")
('Feri', "(I don't think she's caught on yet...)")
('Van', "(I don't blame her. We barely know what the hell's<br/>goin' on ourselves.)")
('Bergard', "(Indeed, that we don't.)")
('Candy', "I like the bluish hue it's got! Kinda goes with the<br/>weird patterning.")
('Candy', "Whoever did this must've had to work super hard<br/>painting all this! They've got the entire<br/>town decorated!")
('Candy', "Woohoo! It's festival time, baby! C'mon, everybody!<br/>Party hard and get your drink on! I wanna see you fly<br/>your freak flags!")
('Candy', "I've got plenty of booze to go around today!<br/>C'mon, drink up, drink up!")
('Candy', 'Heck, I bet I could spray my stock all over the street<br/>and still have enough left for the bar!')
('Candy', 'You know, they hold lots more than just tournaments<br/>at the colosseum. They have all kinds of shows<br/>there, too.')
('Candy', 'Oh, man! If you can catch one of the monster-slaying<br/>exhibitions, those are just EXHILARATING!<br/>Highly recommend them!')
('Candy', "Buuut they're not doing anything like that today.<br/>Plenty to do here, though! Lemme fetch you a drink,<br/>it'll cheer you right up!")
('Candy', "I've been running into trouble lately... I keep getting<br/>all these rough customers.")
('Candy', "I don't know what, but I guess something big<br/>happened, because all these weirdos have been<br/>flooding in down here.")
('Candy', "They're great for business, but they're a teensy bit<br/>scary to deal with, you know?")
('Candy', "Now, I'm...not the sharpest tool in the shed. I don't<br/>really know much about what goes on outside my<br/>ditzy little bubble.")
('Candy', "But I'm not worried. This area always has a way of<br/>bouncing back from trouble. That's what I love<br/>about it!")
('Candy', "And don't you worry, baby, heehee. No matter how<br/>low you go, you'll always have a place here with me<br/>and everyone else! ㈱")
('Van', "Heh, thanks. I'll keep that in mind.<br/>(I know what that's like... I'd rather swim than sink,<br/>that's for damn sure.)")
('Candy', "You know what's great about the Blacklight District?")
('Candy', "The sun never rises on this place! It's always<br/>nighttime down here—and that means PARTY time!<br/>So sit that butt down and drink until you drop! ㈱")
('Candy', "And you're not the only one who's invited—all of you<br/>should stay here and have some fun! Take it from me:<br/>you'll be glad you did!")
('Candy', 'The colosseum is really buzzing today... Must be<br/>something big going on up there.')
('Candy', "I'd say that's as good a reason to let loose and party<br/>hard, though, don't you? I've got just the right drinks<br/>to make that happen!")
('Candy', "In fact, here's a secret: it REALLY turns me on when<br/>somebody buys one of my pricier bottles. Do that and<br/>maybe I'll throw in an extra treat. Mmm! ㈱")
('Agnès', "They...er, sure don't have places like this on<br/>the surface.")
('Aaron', 'You had my attention when you mentioned the<br/>colosseum...but maybe that can wait.')
('Van', "That's what no laws and no regulations does to<br/>a place. Just don't let 'em sucker you in, or you'll<br/>regret it.")
('Joe Browning', "Rahaha! The plan's simple: just kill the<br/>bastards! If they get you, just take 'em down<br/>with you! Got it?!")
('Joe Browning', "Now let's roll, boys! We've got some cleaning<br/>up to do!")
(15211, "Bit soon to be leaving, isn't it? These things aren't<br/>actually dead yet.")
(15212, "So what if they aren't? We're here for the boxer—he's<br/>useful for our plans. Now let's follow along and get<br/>to hunting.")
('Joe Browning', "WOOO, BABY! Now THIS is what I'm<br/>talking about!")
('Joe Browning', "Kill those monsters! Kill those hideous freaks<br/>until they're all dead! KILL THEM!<br/>KILL THEM! KILL THEM ALL!")
(15211, "Goddess almighty, would that boxer shut up?<br/>He's getting a bit too excited about bashing devil<br/>heads for my liking.")
(15212, "Tell me about it. The drugs must've fried whatever<br/>brain cells he had left... Oh, well. Doesn't hurt having<br/>extra brute force to throw around.")
('Joe Browning', 'Whoa, whoa, whoa! What the hell are those<br/>things, huh?!')
('Joe Browning', 'The annual Apex Showdown was supposed to be<br/>afternoon, but this shit is way too crazy for that!')
('Joe Browning', "...Bah, whatever! If you're here for a blood bath, then<br/>let's turn this place into a slaughterhouse! RAAAH!")
('Joe Browning', "Hoo yeah! The Apex Showdown's only three days<br/>away—that's where they crown this year's champion!")
('Joe Browning', "I'm getting pumped up, man. Shit like that's what I<br/>call living!")
('Joe Browning', 'This is all I live for now! Real, raw ass fights with all<br/>the pain and thrills you could ever ask for! BRING<br/>IT ON!')
('Joe Browning', "Well, what've we got here? You jumping into<br/>the fray? Hell yeah, you're my kind of man!")
('Joe Browning', "They're doing exhibition matches for the tournament<br/>right now. Get on this shit and show everyone what<br/>you're made of!")
(15211, "(Craaap... I didn't sign up for this. All I wanted to do<br/>today was a little recon.)")
(15212, "(They're bound to make some moves soon. I should<br/>just lay low and blend in for now.)")
('Van', "(Can't say I recognize those jaegers. Guess this is the<br/>place all the cops go to for sniffin' out intel.)")
('Joe Browning', "All right! Five-hundred more reps today, let's do this!<br/>Grrrah!")
('Joe Browning', "I used to be a famous boxer back on the surface—<br/>buuut then the drugs came a-callin'.")
('Joe Browning', "I fell about as low as a guy could fall... But you<br/>know something? Life here ain't so bad.")
('Joe Browning', 'This place is rotten to shit, but you can do whatever<br/>you want down here! I love it! Hell, you can leave<br/>guys half-dead, nobody cares!')
(15194, "That's the spirit, Joe! Can't wait to see you kick ass in<br/>your next match!")
(15195, "Kill that stupid bastard, you hear me? I've got all my<br/>money riding on you!")
('Joe Browning', "Don't have to tell me twice! Once I'm done<br/>with him, we're havin' ourselves a good<br/>old-fashioned bloodbath!")
('Joe Browning', "I'll knock the sumbitch out in one blow, and<br/>I won't stop until this whole town's red!<br/>GAHAHAHA!")
('Zin the Immovable', "Well, that got weird...but I'll never turn down a<br/>challenge from him.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Especially not after our showdown back in Liberl.<br/>That match had some implications...<br/>Big implications.')
('Zin the Immovable', "For now, I think I'll just hang back and see what the<br/>Butterfly and Silverblade have to offer.")
('Doctor Isabelle', "Sorry, I've got a ton of work on my plate right now.<br/>Can't talk much.")
('Doctor Isabelle', "Hmm... Actually, maybe I should get to work on his<br/>surgery while I wait for Leon to get back. He's sure<br/>taking his sweet time...")
('Doctor Isabelle', "Anyway, I hear you guys are getting involved in some<br/>big operation. Whatever you do, just make sure you<br/>don't come back in body bags, got it?")
('Quatre', 'Of course. Dying would be rather bad.')
('Van', "Right back at you, doc. You seem to be goin' a<br/>million selge a minute there. Don't burn yourself<br/>out, yeah?")
('Doctor Isabelle', "Now there's a tantalizing case study! I haven't felt this<br/>intrigued since they kicked me out of the medical<br/>community in Remiferia.")
('Doctor Isabelle', "Things are about to get a lot more stimulating around<br/>here—and it's all thanks to him.")
('Doctor Isabelle', 'I actually get along pretty well with her, enigmatic<br/>though she is.')
('Doctor Isabelle', "It's just a shame she can't have the hard stuff when we<br/>get together. I get why, but still.")
('Doctor Isabelle', 'Hmm... How feasible would it be to have a pill that<br/>accelerates the breakup of alcohol in the body?<br/>Overclocking the liver, perhaps?')
('Doctor Isabelle', "Word through the grapevine is, the church has some<br/>similar drug. If I could just find a way to reverse<br/>engineer it, I'd be in business!")
('Doctor Isabelle', 'I heard what you guys have been up to lately.<br/>Sounds like you make quite a splash over at the<br/>old capital.')
('Doctor Isabelle', "I also heard some stuff about Almata's leadership—<br/>sounds like they had quite the intriguing lineup, to<br/>say the least.")
('Doctor Isabelle', "Did they really have a 130 year-old ageless wonder on<br/>their team? What a medical marvel... I'd have loved to<br/>get a good look at him.")
('Doctor Isabelle', "At that age, I bet his body was indestructible—and<br/>therefore the perfect guinea pig. I bet I could've<br/>opened him up any which way I wanted...")
('Van', "You sound like you miss him. Word of advice:<br/>don't—he ain't worth it.<br/>(What a freak. Sayin' all that with a straight face...)")
('Doctor Isabelle', "I made plenty today at work, so tonight, I figured I'd<br/>treat myself to a well-earned break.")
('Doctor Isabelle', "I've known Renne here since her Kitty days—we got<br/>to know each other online.")
('Doctor Isabelle', "I never thought I'd get to meet her in person all these<br/>years later—so young, and yet she's grown so much!")
('Doctor Isabelle', "It didn't take her long to start marching to the<br/>Blacklight beat. But I suppose with a résumé like<br/>hers, she can adapt to just about anything.")
('Van', "(Shoulda figured she'd know about her society ties.<br/>Man, what DOESN'T this woman know?)")
(15213, 'Those Almata bastards! They hit our hideout and<br/>nailed our top brass!')
(15214, "Doc, you've gotta come see them! They're on the<br/>outskirts of town. Real deep shit here!")
('Doctor Isabelle', "Outskirts? So he's not inside Edith proper? I can do<br/>house calls, but they don't come cheap.")
('Doctor Isabelle', "I want a million up-front...per person. And then, let's<br/>say, three million for each treatment. Does that sound<br/>good to you boys?")
(15213, 'Wha— You want four million a person?!')
(15214, 'You trying to bankrupt us, you<br/>money-grubbing bitch?!')
('Doctor Isabelle', "If you don't wanna pay, fine. There are plenty of<br/>other doctors out there you can turn to instead.<br/>Take it or leave it, boys.")
('Quatre', '(This is an awfully tense place to be... You can cut the<br/>tension with a knife.)')
('Van', "(Yeah, those mafia goons're always trouble. Just look<br/>the other way and move along.)")
('Doctor Isabelle', 'I get those sorts of clients all the time lately...though<br/>still not as much as before.')
('Doctor Isabelle', "Ever since Almata rose up the food chain, I've had<br/>their victims lining up for blocks outside my door.")
('Doctor Isabelle', "Can't help but wonder how much my services are<br/>REALLY needed, though. Really, I'm just some<br/>black market quack who's fallen from grace. Heh.")
('Doctor Isabelle', "Ah, the spriggan and his lovely assistant again. I see<br/>you've added some new faces to your ranks since we<br/>last met.")
('Doctor Isabelle', 'What brings you here? Somebody hurt I need to take<br/>a look at?')
('Doctor Isabelle', "Well, you know me. Show me the mira and I'll take<br/>a gander. Sick, dead, whatever you need, I can<br/>handle it.")
('Agnès', "Isabelle! I didn't know you worked down here.")
('Aaron', 'What, she a friend of yours or something?')
('Agnès', 'Well, not exactly. She was a client we did some work<br/>for after I first joined.')
('Van', "Yep. As you can probably tell, she's a pretty renowned<br/>doc in the underbelly.")
('Van', "Not my FIRST choice for treatment—she'll patch<br/>you up, but gouge your wallet, too. But hey, she's<br/>always around whenever you need it.")
('Doctor Isabelle', "Ouch, haha! That's a little mean, don't you think?<br/>I'm not some scam artist... I just know what<br/>I'm worth.")
('Doctor Isabelle', 'Money talks, after all—and I listen. Green is a<br/>language we all understand.')
('Risette', '...')
('Feri', "Money...talks? I didn't know they printed talking<br/>money...but I'll take your word for it! You sound like<br/>a really skilled doctor!")
('Doctor Isabelle', 'You know the colosseum behind here? They ship me<br/>a lot of their fighters whenever they get roughed up.')
('Doctor Isabelle', "They're not easy jobs, but I'll always take a look,<br/>provided they've got the coin.")
('Doctor Isabelle', "They're far from my favorite patients, though—too<br/>rowdy for me. They just never sit still.")
('Doctor Isabelle', "Now, the silver spoons who come wailing and<br/>begging with stacks of mira? I love those. They're so<br/>desperate, it's adorable.")
('Doctor Isabelle', "Hmm... I hadn't considered that as a way to restore<br/>cranial nerve functions... Interesting. Very interesting.")
('Doctor Isabelle', 'Thank you, Renne. That helped clear up the part of<br/>your thesis I had trouble parsing. That insight will<br/>come in mighty handy.')
('Renne', "Don't mention it—just know that it's all still theory.<br/>It's up to you and your field to determine how<br/>practical it actually is.")
('Renne', "I'm definitely excited to see how my ideas pan out in<br/>the real world, at any rate. I'll be keeping a very close<br/>eye on those tests. ㈱")
('Doctor Isabelle', "By all means! I'm excited to put your theory to work.")
('Van', "...Do I even wanna ask what harebrained schemes<br/>you're up to? And what's a kid like you doin' down<br/>here at this hour, huh?")
('Doctor Isabelle', "Ah, if it isn't Edith's one and only spriggan.")
('Renne', 'Good evening, Van. Why so concerned? I have<br/>proper permission to leave the campus at night.<br/>Everything is above-board, I assure you.')
('Van', "That's not what I meant and you know it.")
('Van', "So you're still publishin' papers, huh? Man, you're a<br/>real workaholic. You were doin' that five years ago<br/>when we first met.")
('Doctor Isabelle', "So you're the infamous Mille Chaton, are you?<br/>The mysterious researcher who puts out papers at the<br/>speed of light.")
('Doctor Isabelle', 'Medicine, economics, engineering...even literature<br/>and music theory. A polymath through and through.')
('Doctor Isabelle', 'Your work has been very well regarded at<br/>various conferences. I hear you even managed to<br/>attain your doctorate while remaining anonymous.')
('Renne', 'Wow, you do know your stuff. Normally I would<br/>deflect such scrutiny into my identity, but it seems as<br/>though the jig is up.')
('Renne', "My output isn't what it once was. I used to be a little<br/>haphazard in my youth, dabbling in anything and<br/>everything that came to mind.")
('Renne', "But now I'm so busy with the Student Council and<br/>my other commitments, I don't have the energy to<br/>publish as often as I used to.")
('Renne', 'These days, I put out a paper...oh, every six months<br/>or so.')
('Van', "Because, y'know, publishing ONLY two papers a year<br/>at 16 is so bog-standard.")
('Doctor Isabelle', "I think that's a healthy pace to maintain. Your youth<br/>doesn't last forever—it wouldn't do to drown your<br/>teenage years in work.")
('Doctor Isabelle', "My, look at this body! They don't get any fresher<br/>than this! What wonderful samples do you hold<br/>inside, sir?")
('Jacobin', "I... I'm still alive...you know!")
('Jacobin', "Those monsters... Why...did this...have...to happen?<br/>I've...still got to... URGH!")
('Doctor Isabelle', "Hmm... You've had quite the ordeal out there,<br/>haven't you?")
('Doctor Isabelle', "I guess this calls for a dissec... Well, no, I suppose I<br/>should try surgery first. Yes, we'll go with that!")
('Doctor Isabelle', "I'll even treat you for free in exchange for some of<br/>your brain tissue! What do you say?")
('Jacobin', 'Wha—?! H-HELL no, you freaking quack!<br/>Just patch me up like a normal doctor, already!')
('Jaeger', 'Graaah! Damn those...those THINGS!')
('Doctor Isabelle', 'Oh, now this looks bad. That does seem like the work<br/>of a devil.')
('Doctor Isabelle', "Tell you what: I'll give you a discount for my<br/>medical services. I'm extremely interested in you as a<br/>test su—I mean, as a physician!")
('Jaeger', "Are you nuts?! Just treat me like normal! That's all<br/>I want!")
('Doctor Isabelle', "Aww, you're no fun. Well, my standard rate, then:<br/>one million mira. Do we have a deal?")
('Jaeger', "Aidios! The hell kinda doctor ARE you?! I don't need<br/>my wallet bleeding out, too!")
('Lindsey', "Looks like they've been running a bunch of<br/>seek-and-destroy operations down by here.")
('Lindsey', "It's comforting to know that the monsters are being<br/>taken care of...")
('Lindsey', '...but more importantly, those jaegers? Woof!<br/>Now those are some handsome devils. Yes,<br/>VERY handsome... ㈱')
('Lindsey', 'When they come limping back from the battlefield,<br/>stabbed up to within a rege of their life...<br/>*huff* Heeheehee... Oooh, that gets me going.')
('Van', "Good lord, I can't tell if you're just a sadist or you've<br/>lost your damn mind. Talking to you gives<br/>me whiplash.")
('Agnès', "(I think you know as well as I do that she's<br/>beyond help.)")
('Lindsey', "Eeek! Van! There you are! Van, do you have any idea<br/>what's going on?!")
('Lindsey', "There are all these people standing completely frozen!<br/>It's so...creepy! And those who AREN'T frozen,<br/>they're all torn up out here.")
('Lindsey', "I'm so scared! So very, very scared! I don't know what<br/>to do! Help me, Van!")
('Bergard', "Settle down. We've exorcised the devils around<br/>here—you're safe now.")
('Lindsey', 'Y-You have? Oh, Bergard... Thank you, sir! Umm...<br/>Err...')
('Lindsey', "(Ohhh, there's just nothing better than a big, strong<br/>man standing beside me. Van, Bergard...<br/>Anyone, really... *sigh* So dreamy!)")
('Van', '...Anything else we can help with, or are you good?')
('Lindsey', "Oh, I'm fine! If you need to take a break, I've got my<br/>books for you! My collection isn't anything to write<br/>home about, but it passes the time!")
('Lindsey', '(Just make sure to stand right next to me when you<br/>do, please. ㈱)')
('Aaron', "(I respect the hustle, but damn, subtlety's not in her<br/>vocabulary, is it? I've had glasses of water less<br/>transparent than this chick.)")
('Risette', '(Heehee. Some are difficult to read, and some<br/>are...not.)')
('Lindsey', "I used to be able to read books to escape reality.<br/>But this time, it wasn't helping, and I...I lost it.<br/>I really lost it.")
('Lindsey', "I'm sorry for scaring all of you. Don't worry! I think...<br/>I think I'm okay now.")
('Lindsey', "My collection isn't the most interesting thing in the<br/>world, but if you need a break, feel free to give them<br/>a read!")
('Lindsey', '*huff* *huff* D-Did you see them? Did you see all<br/>those people gathered at the colosseum?!')
('Lindsey', 'They all look so big and strong, like they could<br/>tank anything. Like getting...getting stabbed!')
('Lindsey', "Oh, this is too much! I'm getting so flustered just<br/>thinking about it! Oof...")
('Van', 'Man, only you could say that kinda shit with a<br/>straight face.')
('Lindsey', 'EEEP!')
('Lindsey', "O-Oh, my goodness! I didn't see you see there!<br/>M-May I ask your name, sir?")
('Bergard', 'Huh? Me? Well, I go by Bergard Zeman these days.')
('Lindsey', "Oooh, Bergard, is it? You're so burly and handsome!<br/>Can I... Can I call you 'sir'? I'm sorry, MAY I call<br/>you 'sir'? Teehee!")
('Feri', "Oh, no. Don't tell me...")
('Agnès', 'Has she ALREADY fallen for him?')
('Van', '*sigh* Think we already know the answer, but...well?<br/>You fall for him?')
('Lindsey', "I mean, how could I NOT? He's just so big<br/>and strong... I bet I could poke him full of holes and<br/>he'd never leave me!")
('Lindsey', "...Oops! Did I say that out loud? Oh, no! You weren't<br/>supposed to hear that! Now my secret is out! I'm<br/>so embarrassed. So embarrassed...")
('Aaron', "The hell you are. You don't have an innocent bone in<br/>your body.")
('Bergard', "I'm flattered, miss. Thank you. Unfortunately, I have<br/>decided to remain single for the rest of my life.")
('Lindsey', "Aww! But, sirrr! We would go together so well!<br/>Won't you please reconsider? Please?")
('Feri', '(Phew. So much for that romance.)')
('Lindsey', "Bergard Zeman... If only we had met sooner.<br/>We could've done amazing things together, sir.<br/>Really amazing things...")
('Agnès', "(I'm...not sure you ever DID have a chance.)")
('Van', '(Yeah, no. I give her about half an hour before she<br/>finds some other guy to drool over.)')
('Bergard', '(Truly, the Goddess has blessed our world with many<br/>kinds of people. Many, many kinds.)')
('Lindsey', "The Blacklight District is back to normal after what<br/>happened, but... *sigh* It's so boring now.<br/>There's been nothing to excite me.")
('Lindsey', "It gets lonely living underground for so long...<br/>Haven't I put up with this enough? Don't you think I<br/>deserve to enjoy my life again? Don't you?!")
('Van', "Hey, don't look at us—WE ain't on the run.<br/>You reap what you sow, lady.")
('Van', '(Might not hurt to introduce her to our latest<br/>addition at the office. Give her someone new to talk<br/>to for once. Have to be careful, though...)')
('Lindsey', "From the sounds of it, they've got cops everywhere<br/>patrolling the streets above.")
('Lindsey', "I doubt they'll come down here, but it's hard not to be<br/>nervous knowing they're close by...")
('Lindsey', '*sigh* How much longer must I wait until I can<br/>finally, finally leave here and feel the sun on my<br/>skin again? I miss the outside world...')
('Lindsey', "I've loved books for as long as I remember.<br/>Nowadays, they're the only things that can mend my<br/>broken heart.")
('Lindsey', 'Ooh, like this book here! It talks about all the<br/>gruesome ways they used to execute people in the<br/>Middle Ages!')
('Lindsey', "Every page is just dripping with so much love! Oh,<br/>it's irresistible! Just... O-Oh, no! Did I say that<br/>out loud? Teehee! ㈱")
('Van', "(...Why'd I say hello to this chick? Ain't got a damn<br/>clue what she's on about.)")
('Lindsey', "Books are the perfect friend for the lonely<br/>underground lady. You should buy some, too, Van!<br/>You'll love them just as much as I love you! ㈱")
('Lindsey', "If my math's right, then the warrant they have out for<br/>me should expire after three years.")
('Lindsey', "It's been two years since the stabbing, so just a little<br/>more time and then...then I can leave! Leave and live<br/>a life full of love again!")
('Lindsey', "I'd really love to go to a café up on the surface and<br/>enjoy a nice drink.")
('Lindsey', 'Soon! Soon I finally can! I just have to be patient and<br/>hang in there a little longer...')
('Lindsey', 'There are so many scary people down here. And none<br/>of the shops here are all that trendy. It stinks...<br/>REALLY stinks.')
('Lindsey', "But I have to be patient! I can do this! I'm so close, I<br/>can TASTE the freedom! The freedom to love<br/>whoever I want, however I want!")
('Lindsey', "O-Oh, my goodness! Is that... Is that you, Van? It is,<br/>isn't it?! Oh, my beloved fourth boyfriend has finally<br/>returned to me!")
('Agnès', '...What.')
('Aaron', "Damn, chief. Save some girls for the rest of us.<br/>What chick in this town DON'T you have crawling<br/>all over you?")
('Van', "Oh, for—I'm OLD, not INSANE! You really think<br/>I'd get with a girl like her?! Piss off!")
('Lindsey', 'B-But...no! You saved me! You held my hand and<br/>rescued me from those awful, no-good cops on<br/>my tail...')
('Lindsey', 'You were my knight in shining armor, saving me<br/>from those false charges. Just remembering it gives<br/>me butterflies. *sigh* ㈱')
('Van', "...Yeah, uh, if those charges were false, then I'm<br/>Sheena Dirke. Bullshit, lady.")
('Van', "You really oughta kick that habit of yours, stabbin'<br/>every guy you fall for like they're some kinda<br/>cork board.")
('Feri', 'Wait, what did you say she does?')
('Risette', 'Pardon me if this sounds like an obvious question,<br/>but...may I ask why you go to such lengths?')
('Lindsey', "Teehee! Oh, that's just so embarrassing! Are you<br/>really going to make me answer?")
('Lindsey', "I mean, what WON'T a girl do for love? She'll do<br/>whatever it takes to make a man hers—each and every<br/>last rege of him! It's only natural! ㈱")
('Aaron', "(This chick takes 'possessive' to a whole new level.)")
('Agnès', "(She's certainly a...unique person, even under<br/>her circumstances.)")
('Agnès', "(Hold on. Doesn't that mean...?)")
('Feri', "(Van could be next! His life's in danger!)")
('Van', '(The hell it is! I just told you, she and I are NOT<br/>a thing. Period.)')
('Lindsey', "It's only normal for a girl in love to be a<br/>little possessive! Her man should be ALL hers! ㈱")
('Lindsey', "That's why I stab every boyfriend of mine, like a little<br/>pin cushion! And then, when I'm done, I tell them<br/>I'm breaking up with them...")
('Lindsey', "*sigh* Why does it have to be like this? Why do the<br/>police always get involved when it's just a tiny<br/>little argument? It makes no sense...")
('Lindsey', "Oh, well. For now, I'm laying low until things<br/>cool down. I have you to thank for making it all<br/>possible, my love...")
('Lindsey', 'Anyway, I like to collect books in my free time!<br/>Feel free to look around and see if any of them<br/>interest you.')
('Risette', '(For a collection of books, these make for a...rather<br/>stark selection, I must say.)')
('Agnès', '(Yeah, she has a lot of romance novels and...erm.<br/>Prison diaries. She certainly has very specific tastes.)')
('Van', "(Smile and wave, gang, smile and wave. You try to<br/>actually hold a conversation with her and she'll break<br/>your mind in half.)")
('Filenkov', "I got in touch with the kids over in Old Town.<br/>That's one less thing to worry about, at least.")
('Filenkov', 'Now I need to do what I can to help down here.<br/>That way, when I get back home, I can tell them I<br/>did my part!')
('Filenkov', "It seems there's some big operation that's about to<br/>kick off soon. Can I help with supplies at all?")
('Filenkov', "*sigh* Well, quite the fine mess we've found ourselves<br/>in, isn't it?")
('Filenkov', "I'm concerned about the kids over in Old Town, but<br/>they should be okay. They're a tough bunch, I think<br/>they can handle themselves.")
('Filenkov', "Are the lot of you headed out? If you need any work<br/>done before you go, I'm more than happy to help.")
('Filenkov', "I do know how to tune a Xipha. I'm sure you folks<br/>can always use someone like that, no?")
('Filenkov', "It won't do to panic. We must keep calm and get a<br/>read on the situation—knee-jerk reactions will only<br/>come back to bite us.")
('Filenkov', "Either way, I'm glad I was able to stock up on all<br/>these Xipha parts before all hell broke loose.")
('Filenkov', 'Hopefully, they can be of use to the people down here.')
('Filenkov', 'That Yimai, haha. He never changes, does he?')
('Filenkov', "Now that I'm finally back in Edith, I'm going to give<br/>his lineup a good, long look. I can always count on<br/>him to stock the strangest things!")
(15290, 'Hey, you! What are you standing around for? You got<br/>anything better to do, huh? Move along.')
(15291, 'You just loitering or are you some kinda spy? Who do<br/>you work for, huh? Hey! Answer me, punk!')
('Clutch', "Eeek! N-No sir, I'm not a spy! I-I-I'm just lost and I<br/>don't know where to go or what to do! P-Please, can<br/>you help me?!")
(15290, "...Oh. Just a normal-ass civvie. Heh, no wonder you're<br/>shaking in your boots. Haven't been down here<br/>before, huh?")
(15291, "Take my advice: find a bar and lie low. We're about<br/>to round up these monsters and put 'em down—<br/>gonna get real nasty, real fast. Got it?")
('Clutch', 'Y-Yes sir! Thanks for letting me know!<br/>(...Huh! That guy was surprisingly nice!)')
(15290, "We're about to start clearing out the monsters here—<br/>civvies like you'd best get outta the way. Bar's over<br/>that way, yeah?")
(15291, "Might find some thugs in there, but most of 'em are<br/>frozen over or whatever shit that is. Just stay calm and<br/>don't make a fuss.")
('Clutch', "(That's all I have to do? Wow, I guess these guys<br/>aren't as bad as they seem! Okay... I can do this!<br/>No problem!)")
('Clutch', "Eeek! How did I get here?! I was just running away<br/>from those monsters and now I'm... Where AM I?!")
('Clutch', "I'm just completely lost. I have no idea how to get<br/>out, either. Why is this happening to me...?")
('Clutch', "I have no idea what's going on up above, either.<br/>Not that it matters when I doubt I'm ever going to<br/>make it out anyway, ahaha! Ahahaha!")
('Bracer Alvis', 'Huh. Well, hello there. You know, I always had a<br/>feeling you frequented this place—guess I was right<br/>after all.')
('Bracer Alvis', "Anyway, let's just stay in our own lanes here, all right?<br/>I'll look the other way if you do.")
('Van', "(Not even tryin' to play it cool this time. Well, fine by<br/>me—I ain't got nothin' to do with you, anyway.)")
('Bracer Ewan', "It's been a hot minute since I last checked this place.<br/>They've got a really nice lineup today.")
('Bracer Ewan', 'Like this greatsword here. What do you think of<br/>it, Lahad?')
('Bracer Lahad', "It's pretty nice, yeah. Got this back alley blacksmith<br/>vibe to it... I like it.")
('Bracer Alvis', "You two are way too comfortable here... I dunno how<br/>you do it. I can't stand these kinds of places.")
('Bracer Ewan', "Oh, don't be such a spoilsport, Alvis. A bracer is<br/>responsible for ALL citizens, no? Including the ones<br/>in the gutters.")
('Bracer Ewan', "Y'know, that's why Regina worries about you so<br/>much—you're always so high-strung on the job.")
('Bracer Alvis', 'I mean...what? What does Regina have to do<br/>with that?')
('Bracer Ewan', '(Oh, for the love of Aidios, TAKE THE HINT!<br/>You big dense blockhead!)')
('Bracer Lahad', '*sigh* Okay, how about this: you two hold a<br/>competition between yourselves. The winner gets to<br/>take Regina on a dinner date.')
('Bracer Alvis', "Sounds good to me! I mean, I still don't get why<br/>you're bringing her up in this, but I'm not gonna lose<br/>either way! My pride's on the line!")
('Bracer Ewan', 'You were alarmingly quick to agree there... Wait, why<br/>would I have dinner with her? I have a girlfriend.<br/>This is just...')
('Bracer Ewan', "...Oh, whatever. Fine! You're on, and I'm not<br/>gonna lose! I swear on my honor as a B-rank bracer!")
('Bracer Regina', '...Yes, the situation is a lot more insidious than<br/>we anticipated. Lots of unknowns roaming around<br/>down here.')
('Bracer Regina', 'There are no signs of A, either, which is<br/>rather unsettling... Right... Uh-huh.')
('Bracer Regina', "Understood. All right, I'll keep checking as I pull out.<br/>*sigh* Hopefully I still dig something up, but I'll just<br/>have to wait and see.")
('Judith', '(The guild is really pulling out all the stops.)')
('Judith', "(But we shouldn't linger here. Let's get out of here<br/>before somebody recognizes me!)")
('Van', "(One of Calvard's best actresses, and you can't<br/>convince people you're someone else?)")
('Agnès', '(...You know, he does have a point.)')
('Bracer Lahad', "Those two never change, do they? They've been like<br/>that ever since they were rookies.")
('Bracer Lahad', "The more things change, the more they stay<br/>the same. They're capable bracers now, but their old<br/>habits are hard to kick.")
('Bracer Lahad', "Maybe that falls on me as their mentor... I've got<br/>room to improve myself, I reckon. I do need to do a<br/>better job of reining in Ewan.")
('Bracer Ewan', 'Man, how does Alvis function with a head<br/>that dense? Hopefully once I get the guy to come to<br/>his senses, he and Regina...')
('Bracer Ewan', '...Or, wait. He only gets to invite her to dinner if<br/>I lose. And if I lose, then I look bad, and if I<br/>look bad...')
('Bracer Ewan', '...Okay, this is kind of a problem. What do I do?<br/>Should I just win and let him figure it out on<br/>his own? Hmm...')
('Van', "(Man, must suck bein' that dude's wingman.<br/>He's really fussin' over it.)")
('Sylvie', "I didn't expect I'd end up working with the Chief<br/>Giscard himself when I first came here for materials.")
('Sylvie', "He and I have different specialties, but there's still<br/>plenty I can learn from him. It should be a good<br/>learning opportunity for Kaina, too.")
('Sylvie', "But all that learning won't matter if we don't make it<br/>through today. We've gotta give this our all! You can<br/>count on me for support!")
('Kaina', 'This is all just...insane. Absolutely insane. If it turns<br/>out Almata is behind this, too, I swear to Aidios...')
('Kaina', "No, I can't dwell on this. I've gotta help Sylvie and<br/>the Chief however I can—they need us now!")
('Kaina', "The guild's looking after Lashkar right now, which I<br/>really appreciate. That lets me focus on the<br/>fighting here!")
('Kaina', "We'll use the power of technology to take<br/>down Almata. That's my way of getting revenge on<br/>them as a tradesman!")
('Kaina', "I've really got a long way to go before I can reach<br/>Sylvie's level.")
('Kaina', "But I'll still fight to the very end! Supporting all of<br/>you guys is my own little way of getting revenge on<br/>the bastards!")
('Kaina', "So don't be afraid to ask me for any help you need!<br/>As Sylvie's assistant, I'm ready to do whatever<br/>it takes!")
('Olivia', 'Goodness me. I had no idea such a place existed so<br/>close to my apartment!')
('Olivia', 'I stumbled into here by accident—I was trying to<br/>follow a woman much faster than I.')
('Olivia', "I suppose it's relatively safe. There seem to be no<br/>monsters down here, at least... Still, just what have I<br/>gotten myself into?")
('Olivia', 'I really wanted to talk to that woman, but she seems<br/>to have disappeared. Where in the world could she<br/>have gone...?')
('Butler Markley', '*huff* *huff* I am, of course, relieved that the<br/>mistress is unharmed. But why, oh, why did we have<br/>to end up in a place like this?')
('Butler Markley', "It's so...disorderly. I shudder to think what the Master<br/>will have to say if my mistress succumbs to its<br/>degenerate proclivities.")
('Reporter Chen', "*huff* *huff* Well...guess I haven't kicked the bucket<br/>just yet.")
('Reporter Chen', "Where the heck am I, though? Looks pretty crowded,<br/>but I don't recognize this area at all.")
('Reporter Chen', "I was running from a bunch of monsters, turned<br/>down an alleyway, and here I was. I never imagined<br/>I'd find something like this!")
('Reporter Chen', "I'm just... I'm flabbergasted that I never heard about<br/>this place in all my years as a reporter.")
('Reporter Chen', "I hope Marielle and San are doing okay, too...<br/>They tend to have better luck with these things than I<br/>do, but I just can't help but worry.")
('Reporter Chen', "Urgh! If I hadn't torn my stupid calf, I'd be running<br/>straight back to the Times office right now... *sigh*")
('Reporter Chen', "Of all the times to go and get myself hurt, why'd it<br/>have to be now? I swear, I really am cursed...")
('Peter', "I heard the surface is all out of sorts. The Tyrell<br/>District is calming down, but it's panic<br/>everywhere else.")
('Peter', "I hope my dad and the girls are doing okay... I heard<br/>the movie theater's taking in a bunch of evacuees, so<br/>that's good.")
('Peter', 'What the hell is happening here?! First all those<br/>people get frozen, and now those freaking monsters<br/>are crawling everywhere!')
('Peter', "And now I'm in this weird-ass place, whatever it is...<br/>I'd be in trouble if I didn't find it, but still, why'd this<br/>all have to happen?!")
('Peter', 'I wonder how the girls and my dad are doing...<br/>San and Marilyn had just split up when everything<br/>went down.')
('Peter', 'Man, and my dad and I were starting to talk<br/>again, too. I thought this year was actually going to<br/>end on a nice note... So much for that.')
('Peter', "Why did this have to happen? They don't<br/>deserve this... *sigh*")
('Aaron', "Come on! Get 'em! No, not like that, you dumbass!<br/>Hook 'em! Right! RIGHT!")
('Van', "I thought I recognized that head of hair. Good<br/>fight, huh? You're pretty riled up there.")
('Aaron', 'Good fight is right. Got a grudge match going on.<br/>The one I was yelling at, he just barely lost to this<br/>other guy last time.')
('Aaron', "He lost me my money, but I'll get it back this time!<br/>I got a hunch! C'mon, how about you throw some<br/>mira in, too? It's real hype shit!")
('Van', "*sigh* Didn't take long for 'em to reel you in, huh?<br/>Punks gonna punk, I guess.")
('Aaron', "I've got buddies who are just as into all this as me.<br/>We like to bet on who wins.")
('Aaron', "You should get in on the fun, chief. Once you start,<br/>you won't be able to stop.")
('Bergard', 'I, too, am curious to see how this match ends.')
('Bergard', "If things do get out of hand, I'll step in and calm<br/>them down.")
('Bergard', "Go ahead and do your rounds—I'll handle the rest.")
('Renne', "So, Agnès tells me that you're going on something of<br/>a company retreat next week.")
('Renne', "I must say, it sounds like fun! Perhaps I'll stow away<br/>inside someone's truck and come along for the ride.")
('Van', "You might still be pretty short, but not as much as<br/>when we first met. Don't think you'll fit into<br/>anybody's suitcases anymore.")
('Van', "But honestly, you don't have to go to all that trouble.<br/>You're welcome to tag along if you like. We owe you<br/>big time for all your help at Basel.")
('Van', "We got room for one more. You're in if you want it.")
('Renne', "That's sweet of you to offer. Alas, I have plenty of<br/>obligations keeping me busy next week, so I'll have<br/>to pass.")
('Renne', 'That said, I hope you and your lovely assistants all get<br/>some very well-earned rest—Agnès especially.')
('Renne', "She's been a real busy bee, between your work and the<br/>Student Council. Make sure you treat her well,<br/>all right?")
('Van', "Of course. I get I ain't the best influence, but I ain't a<br/>slave driver.")
('Van', '(Renne could stand to take her own advice, too.<br/>That girl never stops. But, well, she has her friends<br/>and family to help with that, I guess.)')
('Renne', "Thinking about it, we HAVE known each other for<br/>quite some time, haven't we?")
('Renne', 'I met our intrepid reporter friend around the same<br/>time, too...')
('Renne', "...I'm sorry. Should I not be dredging all of that<br/>back up?")
('Van', "Heh. Yeah, I'd appreciate it, if I'm bein' real<br/>with you.")
('Van', "(Those were rough times for her, to put it lightly.<br/>She was walkin' through Gehenna...)")
('Van', 'Not to change the subject, but it sounds like<br/>Buzzraider beat you guys to the punch the other day.')
('Dingo', 'Oh, the thing with Judith Lanster? Yeeeah...<br/>That they did. Our editor gave me an earful about it.')
('Dingo', 'But, well, they beat us fair and square—nothing I can<br/>do about that. Now we just wait and see if their<br/>report actually holds water.')
('Van', "You said it. She's a ditz with capital DDs, but I just<br/>don't see her pullin' some midnight tryst for a dope<br/>like him.")
('Van', 'I can see HIM doing it, though, the horndog.')
('Dingo', "Hah. You got that right. I imagine the truth is<br/>somewhere in the middle—and we'll happen upon it<br/>soon enough.")
('Dingo', "If there's anything this job's taught me, it's that the<br/>truth tends to show itself right when you least<br/>expect it.")
('Van', "You might be on to somethin' there. That just your<br/>intuition talkin', or you keepin' secrets again?")
('Van', "Like with that Kitty case back in the spring.<br/>You knew what was up and you still kept your<br/>mouth shut. I haven't forgotten that, y'know.")
('Dingo', "Oh, let go of that already. I just didn't want to<br/>interject myself into that whole debacle.<br/>Nothing more to it.")
('Quatre', "(Huh. Is it just me, or does Van seem to...loosen up<br/>around him? They talk to each other like<br/>they're brothers.)")
('Feri', "(Heehee. It's not just you. You can tell they're<br/>good friends.)")
('Risette', "(Indeed. I don't believe I've ever seen Mr. Arkride act<br/>in such a manner. Rather a change of pace.)")
('Agnès', '(I believe Mr. Kincaid is older than him, too...<br/>He might be the youngest in his old friend group.)')
('Agnès', "(But I guess he's close enough to Dingo that they talk<br/>more like brothers.)")
('Aaron', "(Heh, what a hypocrite. Treats us lackeys like we're<br/>all little kids, only to turn around and baby himself<br/>with this guy.)")
('Dingo', "Anyway, I've gotta jet. I have some investigative work<br/>to wrap up this evening.")
('Dingo', "Y'know, you guys have really been making waves with<br/>all the work you're doing—just don't burn yourselves<br/>out, okay?")
('Van', "Same to you, pal. Work ain't everything, yeah?")
('Judith', "I still don't get how you ended up here, of all places.")
('Judith', "I did hear you were back home tying up some loose<br/>ends, but that's about it.")
('Rixia', 'Mhm. My travels actually took me to President<br/>Rocksmith, as fate would have it.')
('Rixia', 'After what happened the other day, I wanted to<br/>assess the situation for myself.')
('Van', "I still don't get what you're doing down here, of<br/>all places.")
('Van', "I knew you were sortin' some stuff out back home,<br/>but that's about it.")
('Rixia', 'Mhm. My travels actually took me to President<br/>Rocksmith, as fate would have it.')
('Rixia', 'After what happened the other day, I wanted to<br/>assess the situation for myself.')
('Agnès', 'Fair enough.')
('Agnès', 'Thanks again for everything you did in Oración, by<br/>the way. We really, really appreciate it!')
('Aaron', 'Agreed. Cao pulled his own weight, but you were the<br/>real ace in the hole.')
('Feri', "Yeah, I'm so glad we had you around when we did!<br/>You did great!")
('Aaron', 'What she said. I know you did a lot behind the scenes<br/>after we all duked it out back there.')
('Feri', "That was amazing how you and Heiyue were able to<br/>keep Almata in check like that. That couldn't have<br/>been easy!")
('Rixia', 'Oh, no need to thank me. I just did what I could<br/>to help.')
('Rixia', "I may have moved to Crossbell, but Calvard is still<br/>my homeland. I won't allow them to defile it.")
('Rixia', "So I'm happy I was able to help however I could.")
('Judith', 'Got it. That makes more sense now.')
('Rixia', 'I may have moved to Crossbell, but Calvard is still<br/>my homeland.')
('Rixia', "I won't just sit by and let them ruin my home. I was<br/>happy to help however I could.")
('Van', "Got'cha. Now it all adds up.")
('Bergard', 'I understand that you are on leave from your troupe.<br/>Do you intend to return soon?')
('Risette', "I understand that you're currently on leave from Arc<br/>en Ciel. Do you plan to return to the troupe soon?")
('Quatre', "I know you're taking a break from Arc en Ciel at<br/>the moment. Do you plan on getting back together<br/>with them soon?")
('Rixia', "I do, yes. I'm booked for a handful of events<br/>coming up.")
('Rixia', "Once the Revolution Festival is over, I'll be making<br/>my way back to Crossbell.")
('Rixia', 'I also want to attend the memorial service for the<br/>victims at Creil... I want to see for myself how the<br/>country responds.')
('Agnès', "That's fair. Thank you for sharing all that with us.")
('Van', "Sounds like you're gonna have your hands full once<br/>you're back in Crossbell.")
('Van', "Hope you're able to take it easy in the meantime, be a<br/>little lazy like our local celebrity.")
('Judith', 'Wha...? Excuse you! Have I been ACTING lazy to<br/>you, huh?!')
('Quatre', "Yes, she's quite the workaholic. I admire that.")
('Risette', 'Indeed. Her work ethic is admirable—albeit perhaps<br/>a little self-destructive.')
('Rixia', "That's the plan: just taking it nice and slow while<br/>I can.")
('Rixia', "I'll be heading back to Crossbell once the Revolution<br/>Festival is over. I have work waiting for me there.")
('Rixia', "But until then, I'm relaxing here in Calvard.<br/>If anything comes up, don't hesitate to get in touch.")
('Rocksmith', "Given my position, opportunities to visit the<br/>Blacklight District are few and far between. I'm glad I<br/>was able to make time for it today.")
('Rocksmith', 'I make a point of interacting with everyone in<br/>Calvard—ordinary civilians and stranger<br/>types included.')
('Rocksmith', "I have to leave the heavy lifting to you and the other<br/>hardworking heroes out there. Rest assured, though,<br/>I'll be helping the efforts myself.")
('Rocksmith', "This is quite the calamity to befall us, isn't it?<br/>You must be a regular citizen from the look of things.")
('Rocksmith', 'Do you have any family? I imagine they must be<br/>worried about you, what with all of this happening in<br/>the middle of the festival.')
('Magisa', 'Y-Yes, I suppose they are. I worry for my<br/>grandchildren out there as well...')
('Magisa', '(Curses... Of all the places to run into that wretched<br/>Samuel Rocksmith!)')
('Magisa', '(And the CID and Flying Swallow are here, too?<br/>Could this get any worse?!)')
('Magisa', "(Can't an old woman get a little rest around here?<br/>I just got away from those monsters! I don't need<br/>these people harassing me, too!)")
('Rocksmith', 'Also, did I see you come in from the subway station<br/>with other civilians in tow?')
('Rocksmith', "That's quite the impressive feat at your age, madam.<br/>Not everyone remains such a hardy walker in their<br/>golden years.")
('Magisa', 'Ah, haha, y-you flatter me. I was a triathlete in my<br/>youth, you see.')
('Magisa', '(Hmph! If this guy goes prying into my past, he and I<br/>are going to have a problem!)')
('Director Gotti', 'Inspiration strikes at the weirdest times. All this<br/>craziness is giving me some really big ideas for my<br/>next picture...')
('Director Gotti', "Man, though, what a place! Everybody here is just a<br/>whack ass, and I love it! You can't make these<br/>folks up!")
('Director Gotti', "Er, not that I'm getting distracted! No, no, I'm still<br/>keeping an eye on Nina and Judith, making sure<br/>they're safe!")
('Director Gotti', "Van, baby! Good to see you! I'm guessing you're<br/>about to take off?")
('Director Gotti', "Hey, you're not in THAT much of a rush, are you?<br/>Grab a seat and join the fun. C'mon, it'll cheer you<br/>all up!")
('Van', "Sorry, Gotti, we're gonna have to take a rain check<br/>on that. Once this is all over, though, I'm down to<br/>shoot the shit.")
('Van', "As for you, Golden Butterfly... You guys at the<br/>society takin' a back seat to all this? What's the plan?")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "That's a difficult question to answer, hon. Truth is,<br/>Ellroy's the one in charge here.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "With the city frozen in place, there's not much point<br/>in the other Anguis getting their hands dirty, as<br/>it were.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "That said, I wouldn't be surprised if McBurn and the<br/>Grandmaster throw their caps in the ring. They're in<br/>a position to do so, anyway.")
('Van', 'Greeeat. Just what I wanted to hear.')
('Bergard', 'Hmm... The Blazing Demon and his master, you say?')
('Director Gotti', "Whoa, whoa, whoa! 'Grandmaster'? 'Blazing Demon'?<br/>What're these names you're throwing around?<br/>That's some juicy stuff! C'mon, fill a guy in!")
('Aaron', "Dude, I know you like sticking your face in every<br/>orifice you can find, but you don't want to know.<br/>Trust me.")
('Risette', "I've heard rumblings about those individuals.<br/>They're not your average criminals, for certain.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'Said the pot to the kettle, heehee. Your own<br/>organization is just brimming with secrets, I hear.')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "At any rate, A and the Gardens may very well get<br/>their wish if something isn't done to stop them.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "Perhaps that's a sign I should play my hand—albeit,<br/>only after I've had some time to rest. You can't rush a<br/>woman on these things.")
('Van', "You really march to the beat of your own<br/>drum, don'tcha? Just, once you DO make a move,<br/>make it count.")
('Feri', "Good luck with that! We're really happy for any help<br/>we can get.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "I'm sure you are, sweetheart—just don't wait on my<br/>account, all right? I'm going to be a good while yet.")
('Director Gotti', "...You don't say. You telling me the Far East has its<br/>share of pleasure quarters, too?")
('Kurogane', "Correct. They're not as abundant as you might be<br/>accustomed to, but they do still exist.")
('Kurogane', "Of course, they're not quite as active as they<br/>once were.")
('Ashladd', "Can't say I'm surprised, given how things are<br/>out there.")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "Indeed. They do still sound like interesting<br/>little venues. I'll have to visit when I get the chance.")
('Van', "(Yeah, I'm, uh... I'm not touchin' that one.<br/>They sound pretty into that discussion.)")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "As for Walter, in case you were wondering, I imagine<br/>he's celebrating. He's always been looking for fighters<br/>who can match his strength.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "That said, I can't help but wonder how a certain<br/>alumna of ours will respond to this whole imbroglio.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "Perhaps once I've gotten my beauty rest, I'll venture<br/>up to the surface and have a look around for myself.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'I can almost see the heads spinning over at the<br/>Bracer Guild. The Immovable, joining forces with<br/>yours truly? Scandalous.')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'We may only be fighting together for a short while,<br/>but I fully intend to savor this little treat. Teehee.')
('Hermès', 'We meet again. Got a job to do right now,<br/>I take it?')
('Hermès', "That's a bummer. Wouldn't you prefer calling it a day<br/>and having fun with your assistants instead?")
('Hermès', "...Not that I'm one to talk, admittedly. I've got<br/>deliveries to handle all day and all night, so no time<br/>off for me.")
('Van', "Gotta say, I didn't expect to find you here—how<br/>long've you been down here?")
('Hermès', "Oh, not too long—I'm just here for work.<br/>I'm guessing you and the rest of your office are<br/>taking a breather?")
('Hermès', "Whatever you're up to, be careful. This place has no<br/>shortage of 'unique' characters to look out for.")
('Agnès', 'You can say that again...')
('Van', "Y'know, you're givin' em too much credit.<br/>'Characters' almost makes 'em sound reasonable.")
('Hermès', 'Haha. Well, when you have all these different<br/>factions here, I find it best to stay neutral and avoid<br/>ruffling any feathers.')
('Hermès', "I don't shy away from anyone. You need something<br/>hauled, I'm your mule—for the right price and the<br/>right conditions, of course.")
('Aaron', "(And here I thought she'd gone batshit in setting up<br/>shop down here. Guess it's not that surprising in<br/>retrospect, though.)")
('Van', "(She might not technically be part of the underworld,<br/>but she's got one foot in it for sure.)")
('Hermès', "Just for reference, there's no alcohol in this. I can't go<br/>ferrying around orders all drunk and dizzy, now,<br/>can I?")
('Hermès', "Once I'm done with this, it's straight off to the next<br/>job. *sigh* No rest for us weary freelancers, is there?")
('Van', "Ain't that the truth.<br/>(...Wait, booze or no booze, how the hell is she able<br/>to down that with her helmet still on?!)")
('Agnès', "(You know, that's a really good question. I'm curious<br/>now, too.)")
('Hermès', "Well, if it isn't the spriggan and his merry band<br/>of part-timers. How's it going?")
('Doctor Isabelle', "You've got a funny way of celebrating the festival if<br/>you're spending it down here with us.")
('Van', 'Yo there. Heh, I could say the same for you. All the<br/>places you could get your booze on and you pick this<br/>skeevy dump?')
('Hermès', "Well, let's not jump to conclusions, Arkride. I've still<br/>got work to do, so no alcohol for me.")
('Hermès', 'She and I do have a lot in common—we both extend<br/>our services to the less savory parts of society, for one.')
('Doctor Isabelle', "That's right. We're pretty close—so close, in fact, that<br/>I've actually seen her face beneath that helmet of hers.")
('Van', "Heh, no kidding? Guess you two're closer than<br/>I thought.")
('Van', "Y'know, I always just figured that thing was stuck to<br/>your head and you couldn't take it off.")
('Hermès', "I... Hahaha! You're joking, right? This? This is just a<br/>regular old helmet.")
('Hermès', "You keep buttering me up like that, though, maybe<br/>you'll get to see beneath it, too.")
('Van', 'Damn, hah. You know how to lead a guy on.')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "I get the feeling something interesting is right around<br/>the corner... I'll stick around and keep an eye out.")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "And at any rate, this isn't the worst place to kill time.<br/>I have to wait for Celis to rendezvous with<br/>me anyway.")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "...Ah, wait, that's right. I forgot that I was asked to<br/>do something. I guess I can't hang around here<br/>after all.")
('Doctor Isabelle', "This looks rather intriguing... Oh, I'm sorry, did I<br/>say intriguing? I meant serious.")
('Doctor Isabelle', 'I could sever the wound and derive a sample from it.<br/>Cultivating it might reveal an as of yet<br/>undiscovered pathogen.')
('Doctor Isabelle', "But is it fresh enough for that? Hmm... Maybe it'd be<br/>faster if I simply injured myself instead.")
('Van', "Glad to see you're batshit as ever, doc.")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "There certainly are some colorful people down here,<br/>aren't there? She fits right in.")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'I have an idea, Doctor: what if I went out and<br/>captured some subjects for you?')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "I'd love to help, personally. I'm simply fascinated by<br/>the idea of dissecting some unlucky devils!")
('Doctor Isabelle', "Oooh, you're my favorite kind of assistant! Deal.<br/>Get me those devils and for your reward, you get to<br/>watch me take them apart.")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'That sounds perfect! Oh, but do be careful. I AM still<br/>charged with punishing heretics, so no grafts or other<br/>unholy business, understood?')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'Heeheeheehee! / Aaahahahaha!')
('Aaron', 'Nope. No problems here. Just a sadist and a quack<br/>feeding off each other. Your average day in<br/>the underground.')
('Bergard', "I don't anticipate things getting too out of hand with<br/>Leon to mediate, but you two exercise restraint<br/>nonetheless, yes?")
('Kilika', "The fact that Zin and Walter haven't come back yet<br/>tells me that they've found a promising lead<br/>above ground.")
('Kilika', "I'm just keeping an eye on things down here, for<br/>my part. I'm still prepared to rendezvous with them,<br/>should the need arise.")
('Kilika', "Granted, it's not exactly a good look for the CID to<br/>just play catch-up to the other factions out and about.")
('Kilika', "We may not have the answers to everything, but I<br/>think we're close. Now's the time to pool our<br/>evidence together and start connecting the dots.")
('Warrant Officer Cody', "Ulgh... I can't make sense of all this shit. I'm getting a<br/>headache just thinking about it.")
('Warrant Officer Cody', "At least my older sister is okay. That's a relief...<br/>Now we just gotta figure out how to stop this mess.")
('Warrant Officer Cody', "*sigh* I'm concerned how President Gramheart is<br/>going to act in reaction to all this. Just gotta wait and<br/>see, I guess.")
('Jack', "I saw a ton of booze brands I've never seen at<br/>Langport or Bermotti's joint, so I decided to give 'em<br/>a whirl, and...")
('Jack', "...it was not a good idea. U-Urf! Goddess, I'm gonna<br/>be sick.")
('Jack', "You guys working right now? Nice, keep it up—just<br/>don't work TOO hard, all right? No shame in taking<br/>a break every now and again.")
('Halle', "We've got lots of colorful folks down here already,<br/>and it's not even festival time yet.")
('Halle', "Hardly any point trying to babysit Jack here—it'll<br/>turn out like it always does. Maybe I'll just take a walk<br/>and see what's around here.")
('Jack', '*hic* Water... I need...water...')
('Halle', "I told you to take it easy on the hard stuff while<br/>we're here. We're not on our home turf! You can't<br/>expect them to make stuff the same here.")
('Van', "Oh, hey. Didn't realize you two were in Edith.<br/>Looks like you're havin' a real fun time.")
('Halle', 'Hey there, good to see you.')
('Jack', "We've been working like dogs on the broker stuff.<br/>Thought we could use a break and now here we are.<br/>Just having the time of our lives...")
('Van', 'So what dragged you two all the way here? You on<br/>their tail, I take it?')
('Halle', "Yup. We're trying to figure out how the underworld's<br/>changing now that they're gone—and you can really<br/>only do that on the ground.")
('Halle', "It's pretty calm so far, surprisingly—more than<br/>I expected. Maybe it's because the CID was so on top<br/>of the stragglers.")
('Jack', "Probably. Now that those smug pricks aren't running<br/>around, the underground's settling back down.")
('Jack', "Those drugs, though... Those'll be sticking around for<br/>a while. It's a lot tougher to get those off the streets.")
('Agnès', "That does make sense... That's unfortunate.")
('Halle', 'Actually, this chat just reminded me of something.')
('Halle', "I've heard whispers about some two-bit gangster<br/>who's on the run from the feds now, after he did<br/>some work for those guys.")
('Halle', "Word is, he's camping out somewhere in the<br/>Tyrell District. I don't have anything else to go on,<br/>but I figured you might wanna know.")
('Feri', 'The Tyrell District, huh? Hmm...')
('Van', "Oh, that's a good tip. 'Preciate it.")
('Van', 'Well, have fun, you two. Just try to stay on your feet,<br/>Jack, all right?')
('Prince Sherid', 'Before I forget, I wanted to mention that you might<br/>see a familiar airship above the skies of Edith in time<br/>for the festival.')
('Prince Sherid', 'The Principality plans to make a big splash with it—<br/>all part of our efforts to strengthen our ties<br/>with Calvard.')
('Prince Sherid', 'You should receive more information on the<br/>details erelong.')
('Agnès', "Whoa... THAT airship? The one you were kind<br/>enough to lend me in Oración? That's amazing!")
('Van', "Man, subtlety ain't in your vocabulary, is it?<br/>Still, thanks for lettin' us know. We'll keep an eye out<br/>for that follow-up.")
('Prince Sherid', "I knew my time wouldn't be wasted exploring this<br/>district, but I wasn't expecting to find all this<br/>down here... Very curious, indeed.")
('Prince Sherid', "Naje may grumble about being here, but deep down, I<br/>can tell she's intrigued herself.")
('Prince Sherid', 'You should join us and watch. We would love your<br/>company, my friend.')
('Naje', 'I really object to staying in this vulgar den...<br/>We have no further business down here.<br/>I say we leave posthaste.')
('Naje', "But, as His Highness is wont to do, he'll be staying<br/>down here as long as he pleases... *sigh*")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Bah! Money-grubbin' fox, tryna gouge me at a time<br/>like this...")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "*sigh* But I can't go without that stuff. Price hike or<br/>no, I gotta deal with it.")
('Van', "Everything good? If someone's gougin' you, I can try<br/>and give 'em a word or two.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Oh, you guys. Good work on everything you've done<br/>so far. I can only imagine how rough it's been<br/>out there.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Don't worry about me, though—I'm just a<br/>stubborn bastard. I'll figure this out one way or<br/>the other.")
('Quatre', "Oh. Hello, Supervisor. I didn't know you were here.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Yep. I'm gatherin' up parts for a li'l bunker buster.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Looks like this place has some good stuff to work<br/>with, thankfully—shouldn't take me long to get<br/>packed up here.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Like I said, I'm doing just fine. You kids focus on<br/>your own business instead. I'm sure that's been givin'<br/>you enough grief as is.")
('Van', "Heh heh. 'Preciate it, sir. You take care out<br/>there, yeah?")
('Quatre', "What he said. We'll see you later, Supervisor!")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "What is it? You need somethin' from me?")
('Van', "Yeah. Wanted you to check somethin' out.")
('System', 'Van showed Giscard the Onyx Stel.')
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "...Well, I'll be damned. That's real Onyx Steel,<br/>all right.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Goes by Star Steel as well. It's a real potent metal—<br/>dangerous, too.")
('Van', "Nice. I figured you'd know a thing or two about it.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "That I do. But this is only my second time layin' eyes<br/>on it... It's been ages and ages.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', 'As I recall, only a precious few Eastern blacksmiths<br/>had the skill—and the right—to work with it.')
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Lookin' at it, though, this isn't just one thing. It's a<br/>Zemurian Ore alloy.")
('Van', 'Zemurian Ore? That rings a bell...')
('Van', "Aren't the Empire's Divine Knights made from<br/>that stuff?")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', 'Yup.')
('Chief Engineer Giscard', 'Incidentally, it was Professor Russell who figured out<br/>how to process it.')
('Chief Engineer Giscard', 'After that, Professor Schmidt synthesized this alloy<br/>with it—called it Black Zemurian Ore.')
('Van', 'Man, those three sure get around, huh?')
('Chief Engineer Giscard', 'This, though, this would be as hard to process—<br/>harder, even—than Black Zemurian Ore.')
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "I do know a thing or two about processin' the<br/>stuff, though. Given enough time, I can probably<br/>make this work.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Bein' honest, it's a good chance to test my skills,<br/>heh heh. You want a weapon outta this? I'll do it<br/>for free.")
('Van', "Yo, heh. I ain't sayin' no to that.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', 'Full disclosure, making weapons with this amount is<br/>only going to be enough to arm a single person.')
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Once you've picked what you want, come<br/>lemme know.")
('Van', 'Got it. Thanks.')
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "I've gotta make do with the stuff I've got here. It's all<br/>well built, at least, so I can't complain too much.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Ultimately, I just gotta shut up and get those<br/>eggheads what they need. I'm the chief engineer for<br/>a reason!")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "So don't you worry about us. You just do your prep<br/>work and I'll make sure you head out there in the best<br/>equipment you can get.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', 'All right. Whose weapon do you need me to<br/>work on?')
('Van', 'Could you make me a stun caliber?')
('Van', 'Could you make Agnès an orbal staff?')
('Agnès', 'A-Are you sure? I appreciate it.')
('Van', 'Could you make Feri a rifleblade?')
('Feri', 'Oh, thank you so much! This is an honor!')
('Van', 'Could you make Aaron a set of twin blades?')
('Aaron', "Heh, much obliged. They won't go to waste.")
('Van', 'Could you make Risette a blade gear?')
('Risette', 'Oh, goodness. Most appreciated, thank you.')
('Van', 'Could you make Quatre an orbal pulse gun?')
('Quatre', 'R-Really? I... Thank you, Van.')
('Van', 'Could you make Judith a shooting star whip?')
('Judith', "My, you're a class act!")
('Van', 'Could you make Master some gauntlets?')
('Bergard', 'Oho? Well, thank you, Van.')
('Van', 'Sorry. Need a moment to think about it.')
('Chief Engineer Giscard', 'Take your time.')
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Bet'cher ass.")
('System', "Van's group retrieved the equipment from Old Town<br/>and put Giscard to work on their new weapons.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Aaand there ya go! She's all finished!")
('System', 'Obtained <br/>.')
('Van', "Oh, yeah... This here's the GOOD shit.")
('System', 'Obtained <br/>.')
('Agnès', 'Oh, goodness. I can already tell this is an<br/>incredible staff.')
('System', 'Obtained <br/>.')
('Feri', 'Whoooa! This looks incredible!')
('System', 'Obtained <br/>.')
('Aaron', "Well, holy hot damn. I'm giddy already.")
('System', 'Obtained <br/>.')
('Risette', 'This craftsmanship is just transcendent. My thanks.')
('System', 'Obtained <br/>.')
('Quatre', 'This is an excellent weapon.')
('System', 'Obtained <br/>.')
('Judith', "Oooh! I can't believe how good this thing is!")
('System', 'Obtained <br/>.')
('Bergard', 'Now, this... This is a fine weapon indeed.')
('Van', "Your skills are the real deal. No wonder you're the<br/>head of Basel's artisans.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Oh, it ain't nothin'. Plenty of people who could<br/>make those.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', 'Anyway, if you pick up any more Onyx Steel, you let<br/>me know.')
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "If you're okay with me working it, I'll always be happy<br/>to help.")
('Van', "'Preciate it, Supervisor.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "I've gotta make do with the stuff I've got here. It's all<br/>well built, at least, so I can't complain too much.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Ultimately, I just gotta shut up and get those<br/>eggheads what they need. I'm the chief engineer for<br/>a reason!")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "So don't you worry about us. You just do your prep<br/>work and I'll make sure you head out there in the best<br/>equipment you can get.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', 'Oh? I see you got your hands on some Onyx Steel.')
('Chief Engineer Giscard', 'All right. Whose weapon do you need me to<br/>work on?')
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Bet'cher ass.")
('System', "Van's group retrieved the equipment from Old Town<br/>and put Giscard to work on their new weapons.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Aaand there ya go! She's all finished!")
('System', 'Obtained <br/>.')
('System', 'Obtained <br/>.')
('System', 'Obtained <br/>.')
('System', 'Obtained <br/>.')
('System', 'Obtained <br/>.')
('System', 'Obtained <br/>.')
('System', 'Obtained <br/>.')
('System', 'Obtained <br/>.')
('Van', "Seein' you go at it never fails to impress.")
('Van', 'Thanks, Supervisor.')
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "I've gotta make do with the stuff I've got here. It's all<br/>well built, at least, so I can't complain too much.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Ultimately, I just gotta shut up and get those<br/>eggheads what they need. I'm the chief engineer for<br/>a reason!")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "So don't you worry about us. You just do your prep<br/>work and I'll make sure you head out there in the best<br/>equipment you can get.")
('Shizuna', "I never thought I'd get another opportunity like this<br/>after that whole game in Oración.")
('Shizuna', "Maybe I should make a habit of visiting the<br/>Revolution Festival EVERY year, if it's gonna be<br/>like this!")
('Van', 'Please, no. You stir up enough trouble as is.')
('Shizuna', "Enough about me, though. You guys look like you've<br/>got your hands full with things as usual, which I<br/>totally get.")
('Shizuna', "Can't take it easy just yet, what with the festival just<br/>around the corner and the fallout from everything<br/>with you-know-who.")
('Shizuna', "But don't you guys get the feeling there has to be<br/>more going on? I don't know what, but it's like there's<br/>something else brewing in the air.")
('Aaron', "Sure you're not just being paranoid? Keep talking like<br/>that and you're going to jinx us, girl.")
('Van', '...')
('Shizuna', 'Never a dull moment with you, is there, Van Arkride?<br/>Heehee.')
('Shizuna', "What is it people like to say about you? That you<br/>have a 'nose' for things? It reminds me a lot of the<br/>Unclouded Eye.")
('Shizuna', "Well, whatever comes our way, both in the festival<br/>and beyond, I'm gonna take it all in stride and have a<br/>blast doing it!")
('Shizuna', "I know you guys can't help being busy right now, but<br/>you should consider taking some time off, too. I think<br/>you'll be glad you did.")
('Shizuna', "If you ever want more company, I'm always happy to<br/>tag along!")
('Walter the Direwolf', "I didn't think there was any fun to be had at the<br/>festival, but this might've changed my mind.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "I can't even remember the last time I squared off<br/>against the Golden Butterfly. Bet your ass I'm<br/>booking this rematch.")
('Jacobin', 'Why? Why must a pure, Goddess-fearing Calvardian<br/>such as I endure such humiliation?!')
('Jacobin', 'I had to be rescued from those monsters breathing<br/>down my neck—and not by one of my own, but by...<br/>by a MIGRANT girl!')
('Jacobin', 'Unbelievable. Simply unbelievable! This is<br/>an outrage!')
('Jacobin', 'What a farce! Having my funding cut off was bad<br/>enough. Now people are accusing me of working<br/>for Almata! Can you believe that?!')
('Jacobin', "I couldn't care less what happens to those goons—the<br/>last thing I need is the authorities going after me!")
(15292, "Heh, what's got your panties in a bunch, old man?")
(15293, "Har har har! Hey, barkeep! Get this stuffy fart<br/>some drinks! The man's still too sober, and that<br/>won't do!")
('Jacobin', 'You stay out of this, you backward cretins!<br/>You people epitomize everything I detest—you and<br/>this wretched district are the scum of the earth!')
('Jacobin', "Hmph! And I'll pull this whole bloodsucking weed<br/>from the ground up if I have to! That is my duty to<br/>this fine country!")
('Van', '(Oh, I remember this racist prick. Still up his own ass,<br/>from the sounds of it.)')
('Van', "(Think I'll just leave him be for now. He won't be<br/>causin' any trouble lookin' as scrawny as that—<br/>everybody here'll just laugh at him.)")
('Van', "(There's that far-right 'activist' again. Guess those<br/>assholes in Oración were funding his efforts, too.)")
('Van', "(Guess he flew a little too close to the sun. Maybe if<br/>we're lucky, he'll wise up and start changin' his tune.<br/>Maybe.)")
('Jacobin', "Despite calling themselves the 'Patriot League,' those<br/>spineless fools are all too quick to silence us<br/>ACTUAL patriots.")
('Jacobin', "We're a dying breed, I tell you. The more they reject<br/>us, the more they kill the idea of patriotism itself!")
('Jacobin', 'Surely there must be SOMEONE who sympathizes<br/>with us? Someone who truly cares...but where?<br/>Where are they hiding?!')
('Van', "Well, here we are. The place the city's very worst<br/>call home.")
('Van', "For how long it's been around, it's kinda crazy how<br/>much more lively it's gotten in the past few years.")
('Zin the Immovable', "No kidding. You won't find it on any map, yet people<br/>are still somehow finding their way down here.")
('Zin the Immovable', "But what criminal WOULDN'T be tempted by a<br/>literal lawless zone where they can let off all the steam<br/>they damn well please?")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Might be a bit much for your little ones to handle<br/>right now, though.')
('Van', "...Yeah. Hate to do it, but I gotta introduce 'em to<br/>it eventually.")
('Van', "Can't stay ignorant of its existence forever when<br/>you're in this line of work.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Heh. True enough.')
('Zin the Immovable', "So my impression of you being a mother hen looking<br/>after her chicks wasn't so far off after all, huh?")
('Van', "Oh, can it. So where're we goin'?")
('Zin the Immovable', "Well, let's peek in at the nearby bars for starters.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Watch your back, all right?')
('Van', 'I know.')
('Van', "...You're shittin' me, right?")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Sorry to hold things up.')
('Cao', 'How delightful it is to see you, Mr. Arkride. And you<br/>as well, Immovable.')
('Walter the Direwolf', 'You sure took your sweet-ass time.')
('Walter the Direwolf', "Didn't expect Arkride to be with ya, though.")
('Van', "I'm just here to do him a favor.")
('Van', "But if I'd known we were comin' to see<br/>SCUMBAGS like YOU, I'd have turned him<br/>straight down.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Come on, now. No need to be like that.')
('Zin the Immovable', "I knew you were in Calvard, but it's hard to believe<br/>it's been two years since I last saw your face,<br/>eh, Walter?")
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Not since Jormungandr, huh?')
('Walter the Direwolf', "Bugged the hell outta me we weren't even able to use<br/>that chance to settle the score between us.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Heh. Same here.')
('Zin the Immovable', "So, I'm sure it's no coincidence I was suddenly able to<br/>meet you so easily?")
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Aye. Spoke to these two before you showed up, but...')
('Walter the Direwolf', "...meetups like this here and there ain't such a bad<br/>idea with how little we know about those guys.")
('Van', '...I see now.')
('Van', "We're all after Almata, so we're here to trade<br/>information on 'em.")
('Van', "Didn't think I'd chance into a gathering this major.<br/>So, who's our imposing friend?")
('Ashladd', 'I ask that you proceed as though I am not present.')
('Ashladd', 'Think of me as a random traveler who happened to<br/>be here when you arrived.')
('Van', "That's, uh, asking a lot...")
('Van', "Though the coat and you being part of this group<br/>gives me an idea of who you're affiliated with.")
('Ashladd', '...')
('Zin the Immovable', "To kick this thing off, it's proving impossible to even<br/>learn more about Almata at this point.")
('Zin the Immovable', "Heard a report the other day that a bracer on an<br/>undercover op on them still hasn't come back.")
('Cao', 'We have been in much the same position ever since<br/>the situation in Langport.')
('Cao', 'Not long ago, a cold-blooded warning video was sent<br/>to our council of elders. The kind meant to serve as<br/>an example.')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Ugh...')
('Van', 'They just keep getting worse.')
('Walter the Direwolf', "We've had nothin' like that on our end, but there is<br/>one guy up top who can't seem to wipe the smile off<br/>his face since they cropped up.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "He's one real shitbag, so if HE likes 'em, you know<br/>they're real monsters.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Sounds to me like we all think we're better off<br/>crushin' 'em before they become even more of<br/>a headache.")
('Van', 'This guy—he the one you mentioned a while back?')
('Walter the Direwolf', "I've got a list of questions from the Oathbreaker, so<br/>start running your mouth—or I'll run my fist through<br/>your face.")
('Van', "(The infamous Fourth Anguis, huh? Doesn't quite<br/>sit right...)")
('Zin the Immovable', "I imagine our definitions of 'crush' differ here, but at<br/>least we know where we all stand now.")
('Zin the Immovable', "Save for our friend keeping his cards to his chest<br/>there, anyway. It sounds like the CID's up to<br/>something, too.")
('Zin the Immovable', "Still, wish I could figure out just what their 'boss'<br/>is thinking.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Old Rocksmith's successor, huh? Heard some colorful<br/>rumors about him myself.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "But knowin' he's turned a blind eye to a hole like this<br/>makes him all right in my book.")
('Cao', 'Indeed. President Rocksmith was a broadminded<br/>fellow in his own right...')
('Cao', '...but the current president has proven even more<br/>receptive toward us. Some of the elders are rather<br/>fond of him.')
('Cao', 'Though that does also make him a far more<br/>formidable foe during negotiations.')
('Zin the Immovable', "*sigh* From our perspective, the president's<br/>willingness to work with you guys is one giant,<br/>flapping red flag.")
('Cao', "Oh, do not misunderstand! All of our cooperative<br/>efforts are in line with your guild's code.<br/>Heaven forbid otherwise.")
('Van', "Can you guys not probe each other while I'm stuck<br/>right in the middle?")
('Van', "I feel like I don't even need to be here anymore.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Easy, Arkride. Your part's just about to come up.")
('Van', '...!')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Walter...')
('Walter the Direwolf', "Heh. It ain't often we get a chance like this, and you<br/>can't PICK a better place.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "You weren't satisfied with how we ended two years<br/>ago, either, so what say we pick it up where we<br/>left off? Right here, right now.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Hah. Sounds like a plan.')
('Van', "Wait! You saw this coming, didn't you?!")
('Van', "Hell no! I ain't here to watch two monsters beatin'<br/>the crap outta—")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Who said you'd watch? You and White Orchid<br/>Dragon are joinin'.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Come on. Exchange info, exchange blows—either<br/>way, we're gettin' to know each other.")
('Van', '...?!')
('Cao', 'I admit to some reluctance standing between<br/>combatants of your caliber...')
('Cao', '...but I am also not one to pass up a chance to face<br/>Mr. Arkride and the famed Zin the Immovable.')
('Van', 'Well, you SHOULD BE!')
('Zin the Immovable', "Sorry, Arkride. But this is just how it's gotta be.")
('Zin the Immovable', "We'd lose sight of ourselves if it was just one on<br/>one—and who knows how much damage we'd<br/>cause then?")
('Van', 'Ugh... You damn asshole!')
('Ashladd', "I shall act as observer. Fight to your hearts' content.")
('Van', "Why're you so up for this?! You're welcome to my<br/>spot, you know!")
('Cao', 'Haha. Perhaps another time.')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Ohhhhhhhhhh! / Haaaaaaaaah!')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Ready...')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Ready...')
(40602, 'Begin!')
('Walter the Direwolf', "HAHAHAHA! And ya STILL won't accept that<br/>S-rank promotion! Why the hell not?!")
('Zin the Immovable', "I'm just not ready for it. My Taito skills have nothing<br/>to do with it.")
('Zin the Immovable', "Though it'll sure give me a boost in confidence if I<br/>can beat you here!")
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Heheh! Oh, yeah? Will it, now?')
('Van', "Wh-Whoa! The hell're you—")
(40301, 'Uhh... Hold on a sec...')
(40302, 'Th-This is looking real bad...')
(40303, "I gotta scram—huh? I-I can't move!")
('Cao', 'I fear there is no stopping this.')
('Ashladd', 'I am honored to bear witness.')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Ohhhhhhhhhh! / Haaaaaaaaah!')
('Kilika', 'THAT IS ENOUGH.')
('Zin the Immovable', '...?!')
('Cao', 'Well, then...')
('Van', "You're...")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Kilika!')
('Walter the Direwolf', "Tch. You got here quick. And here I was hopin' we<br/>could duke it out a little longer.")
('Kilika', "I figured you'd have a lot of catching up to do, so I<br/>thought to give you some space. A mistake on my<br/>part, I see.")
('Kilika', 'Are you a future S-rank bracer and a society Enforcer,<br/>or are you infants?')
('Zin the Immovable', 'W-Wait a minute! This was all his fault!')
('Walter the Direwolf', "Don't gimme that! You were all gung-ho until she<br/>showed up, buddy.")
('Van', "Lookin' more and more like 'infants' from where<br/>I'm standing...")
('Cao', 'What a shame. I was rather looking forward to seeing<br/>that to its end.')
('Cao', 'You are a force to be reckoned with, Flying Swallow.')
('Kilika', "It's good to see you, spriggan. I see Zin is causing you<br/>trouble yet again.")
('Kilika', "As for you, Cao...are you sure it's all right for you to<br/>be out of Crossbell after your promotion to president?")
('Cao', 'Worry not. I foisted all responsibility there to Yin and<br/>the SSS.')
('Van', 'This guy has no shame...')
('Van', 'Looks like you brought more suspicious folks to<br/>the party.')
('Dominion Celis', 'What? You got a problem with us, punk?')
('Dominion Celis', "So you're the spriggan of the Republic—but<br/>personally, I think of you as the dropout of the<br/>Kunlun school.")
('Van', 'Wait. Are you...?')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "Now, now, Celis. It's not good to pick fights with<br/>him when you've only just met.")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "Even if he is a shady piece of human waste from<br/>Aidios-knows-where who can't figure out which half<br/>of the moral fence he's standing on.")
('Van', 'Uhh...')
('Dominion Celis', "Wow. Even I wasn't tryin' to be THAT harsh.")
('Cao', 'Curious...')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Hmm...')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'Still, I see it was worth our while to come down here.')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "Who knew a battle between the society's finest<br/>Eastern martial artist and a student of one of the<br/>three great schools would be waiting for us?")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'But perhaps the greatest surprise of all is seeing you.')
('Ashladd', '...')
('Dominion Celis', 'Heh. Thought you were acting kinda funny lately...')
('Dominion Celis', "...but findin' out you're all buddy-buddy with the<br/>society is one thing I didn't see coming.")
('Ashladd', "...I haven't the faintest idea what you're<br/>talking about.")
('Ashladd', 'I am a mere traveler who chanced upon this place and<br/>its current company. Nothing more.')
('Ashladd', 'I ask that you pay me no mind, Mother Celis,<br/>Father Leon.')
('Dominion Celis', "You're not even trying to hide it!")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'Ahaha! You are quite the interesting fellow,<br/>vice captain.')
('Walter the Direwolf', "Heh. Must've been a hard job bringin' a couple of<br/>runts like them down here.")
('Kilika', 'I thought they would make a fine match for you.<br/>We do have an agreement right now, after all.')
('Dominion Celis', "Who're you callin' a couple of runts?!")
('Dominion Celis', "You sure can run your mouth, Direwhelp, but don't<br/>go gettin' cocky.")
('Dominion Celis', 'How about I show you and that hardhead what I can<br/>REALLY do?')
('Walter the Direwolf', '...Yeah?')
('Walter the Direwolf', "With what, missy? That sword? Sure you're gonna be<br/>swingin' it and not the other way around?")
('Walter the Direwolf', "How'd a teenybopper like you even get that damn—")
('Dominion Celis', "...I'm twenty-seven.")
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Huh?')
('Dominion Celis', "I said, I'm TWENTY-SEVEN. Any questions?")
('Walter the Direwolf', '...Huh.')
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Well...I guess some guys are into that kinda thing.')
('Dominion Celis', 'You are SO dead.')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'You had to step on a landmine... She hates when<br/>people talk about her little babyface and impressively<br/>short height.')
('Dominion Celis', 'Also dead.')
('Walter the Direwolf', "Ugh... I'll leave this crap to you, Arkride.")
('Van', 'Why me?!')
('Zin the Immovable', '*sigh* (I have a feeling I know where these three<br/>are from...)')
('Feri', 'Oh! There he is!')
('Van', 'Guys?')
('Agnès', 'Van! ...Wait. Huh?!')
('Aaron', 'Cao! ...What kinda crazy party is this?!')
('Cao', "Well, if it isn't Aaron.")
('Van', "How'd you even find this place? I thought I threw<br/>you off my tail.")
('Elaine', '*sigh* This is what happens when you only keep<br/>people half in the loop.')
('Van', 'Elaine...')
('Zin the Immovable', "*sigh* I didn't think you'd wander down here, too.")
('Dominion Celis', "Ugh... Wait. Isn't she...?")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "The one and only Beauty's Blade. But the woman<br/>next to her...")
('Elaine', 'I happened to run into them during their search<br/>for you.')
('Elaine', 'I did have my doubts on whether to bring them here<br/>or not, but as you can see... Well, in any case, I had a<br/>feeling you were here.')
('Risette', 'My apologies. I had no idea what we were getting<br/>ourselves into.')
('Risette', 'But now that I see it, this place certainly does pique<br/>my interest.')
('Van', '*sigh* Well, I was gonna bring YOU down here at<br/>some point...')
('Van', "...but what's with you beating me to it, Elaine?!")
('Van', "You're the one who's constantly harpin' on about<br/>keepin' 'em outta danger!")
('Aaron', "You going senile? We're used to danger.")
('Feri', 'And besides, I see some other kids down here, too.')
('Agnès', "I know that you have our best interests at heart, but<br/>no one likes being kept at arm's length forever.")
('Van', 'Erk...')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Sorry for all the trouble this ended up causing, man.')
('Zin the Immovable', "But hey, it ended up being a good chance to teach<br/>'em about this place, no?")
('Van', "Oh, please. Don't start actin' like you did<br/>nothin' wrong.")
('Elaine', "I'll say. I have some choice words for you, too, Zin.<br/>You didn't think to discuss your coming here with<br/>anyone else?")
('Elaine', 'Quite the arrogant move on your part.')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Uhh... Well...')
('Kilika', '*sigh*')
('Walter the Direwolf', "Well, fun's over. I've had enough of bein' here.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Today was more about sayin' hi anyway. I've done<br/>what I came for.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Walter...')
('Kilika', 'We will see each other again at some point—even if<br/>the only other place I can imagine that happening is<br/>your prison cell.')
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Heh.')
('Ashladd', 'Well, kind strangers. If you would excuse me.')
('Dominion Celis', "Yeah, that's enough hellos.")
('Dominion Celis', "Sorry for making you show us down here, Chief.<br/>We're outta here.")
('Dominion Celis', 'See you all around sometime.')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "I wouldn't be surprised if we met again—though that<br/>depends on what A does.")
('Cao', 'Well, now that the air has calmed down a touch...')
('Cao', '...perhaps those of us who remain might continue<br/>sharing information?')
('Aaron', 'Man, you never change...')
('Van', "Sounds like there's no room for doubt, then.")
('Van', "Almata's got some other organization workin' for 'em.")
('Kilika', 'So it would appear.')
('Kilika', 'Their funding is at least partly coming from those<br/>who funded the racial terrorism of the past, too.')
('Agnès', "That's...awful.")
('Feri', 'Van was telling us about that not too long ago.')
('Risette', "Our company's risk assessment led us to the<br/>same conclusion.")
('Elaine', 'Up until a few years ago, racially motivated attacks on<br/>those of Eastern and Central Eastern descent were all<br/>too common.')
('Elaine', 'They were known to be orchestrated by white<br/>supremacist groups who traced their origins back to<br/>the old kingdom.')
('Elaine', 'But the situation changed significantly when a rather<br/>large group attacked the trade conference in Crossbell<br/>four years ago.')
('Kilika', "Fortunately, we were able to quell the situation<br/>thanks to an 'insurance policy' we had in place...")
('Kilika', '...and as soon as the crisis was put to rest, the former<br/>president started an aggressive crackdown on<br/>those groups.')
('Kilika', "You didn't hear much from them after that—then the<br/>post-war reparations put the entire issue on the<br/>back burner.")
('Cao', "That's not to say they disbanded, however.<br/>If anything, the economic prosperity provided an<br/>ideal cover for them to continue in secret.")
('Cao', 'And now their cover is coming to an end, bringing<br/>the issue of them to the surface once again.')
('Agnès', '...')
('Aaron', "Well, I don't know how those assholes are tied<br/>to Almata...")
('Aaron', "...but if they've got all those fat stacks at their<br/>disposal, that explains how they got so big so fast.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Yeah. And with that kind of mira, they could bring<br/>people on the outside into the fold.')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Like the group Melchior and that new puppeteer<br/>come from.')
('Zin the Immovable', 'A group able to wipe out a high-ranking company of<br/>jaegers single-handedly—and likely with special<br/>abilities at their disposal.')
('Feri', '...')
('Van', 'So they ARE from the Gardens.')
('Cao', "Heh. I am thoroughly unsurprised you've heard<br/>of them.")
('Cao', 'Few have, even in the criminal underworld.')
('Feri', "What's the Gardens?")
('Agnès', 'Is it some kind of group?')
('Elaine', "They're a criminal organization that's of a different<br/>breed to mafias like Almata.")
('Elaine', "They don't have much in common with the society,<br/>either, mind. We first learned of their existence nine<br/>years ago.")
('Elaine', 'Their modus operandi is gathering orphans and<br/>giving them a first-class education...in assassination.')
('Agnès', '...!')
('Aaron', "Damn... Didn't know stuff like that was even real.")
('Kilika', 'Unfortunately, it very much is. Their members are<br/>few in number, but they complete their missions with<br/>startling success.')
('Kilika', "The organization is divided into several groups, called<br/>gardens, with each being led by an 'overseer.'")
('Risette', 'We are aware of their presence at Marduk as well.<br/>Their threat level is considered to be S+.')
('Risette', 'Internally, it was at one point believed that most<br/>unsolved assassinations were their handiwork.')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Yeah. You can imagine the headache when we even<br/>had another group trying to mimic their playbook.')
('Zin the Immovable', "Still, their name hasn't cropped up very much over<br/>the past couple years.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Not since the overseer of the Garden of Swords was<br/>taken out by two members who fled the organization.')
('Feri', 'Oh, wow...')
('Agnès', "(I feel like I've read that story somewhere before...)")
('Van', '...')
('Agnès', '...What is it, Van?')
('Van', "Nothin'. Anyway, now we know that that group of<br/>monsters is workin' with Almata.")
('Van', "It's still a mystery how they ended up that way—same<br/>with how they wound up with all that<br/>terrorist funding...")
('Van', "...but maybe a more pressing question is WHY<br/>they're workin' together.")
('Feri', 'True...')
('Aaron', "They've got three of the worst tiles that exist. Just a<br/>matter of working out what hand they're going for.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'You a mahjong player, too? Erm, I mean...')
('Zin the Immovable', "You're right. We're gonna need to focus on that<br/>going forward.")
('Cao', 'Indeed—albeit in our own unique ways, no doubt.')
('Kilika', "Well, I believe we've had enough discussions for<br/>one day.")
('Elaine', "Still, it seems clear there's more room for negotiations<br/>between us than some other groups going forward.")
('Cao', 'Heh. I am most humbled you are including us in that.')
('Zin the Immovable', "Well, I don't know about you and Gien, but Heiyue<br/>has its moderates, too. Like Fan.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Take it we can include you guys in that, too, Arkride?')
('Van', "Goes without saying. Hell, we're the common thread<br/>between all of you.")
('Van', "And you're just gonna keep using us as a bridge<br/>between you anyways.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'You got that right. / So we would. / But of course.')
('Van', 'Stop being so in sync!')
('Cao', "I see it didn't take you long to adjust to life in<br/>the capital.")
('Cao', 'Just bear in mind that Lady Ashen is rather worried<br/>about you back in Langport. Do try to exercise<br/>restraint in your daily life, hmm?')
('Aaron', 'Man, she could stand to chill out a little—and you<br/>should be the one checking in on home more often.')
('Aaron', "How's Xin doing, by the way? He's been abroad in<br/>Remiferia for half a year now, right?")
('Cao', 'I believe he is doing rather well. He attends a<br/>distinguished middle school there and is blessed with<br/>many good friends.')
('Van', 'Come to think of it, Chief, I know you go way back<br/>with him and the Direwolf...')
('Van', "...but I would've figured René would handle this<br/>kinda thing.")
('Elaine', "That's right...")
('Zin the Immovable', 'The smart guy you and Elaine grew up with, yeah?')
('Kilika', "He's actually quite occupied with another case for us.")
('Kilika', 'As for what that case is...you will soon see.')
('Van', "Huh? That's sure an ominous way of puttin' it...")
('Van', "And she's one of the more reasonable ones, too.")
('Van', "Why can't the CID be staffed by more...<br/>normal people?")
('Risette', "Forgive me for saying so, but you're a fine one to talk.")
('Feri', "Yeah! I can't believe you came to a place like this<br/>without us!")
('Aaron', "Kinda pisses me off I let you shake me in the first<br/>place, but that's in the past now.")
('Agnès', 'So...just what is this place?')
('Van', "It's called the Blacklight District.")
('Van', "It's the city's unofficial 13th District—and its<br/>dark side.")
('Van', 'A lawless zone that changes location from time to<br/>time and that few cops dare to tread.')
('Van', "It's home to criminals of every kind. Good place for<br/>'em to get together, too.")
('Agnès', 'To think that all this time, such a place was right<br/>under my nose...')
('Feri', 'You know, I feel like Abi said something about it to<br/>me before.')
('Risette', 'I was aware of its existence, but this is my first time<br/>seeing it in person.')
('Risette', "It looks to be a combination of multiple underground<br/>areas that went unused during the city's<br/>urban planning.")
('Aaron', 'Good spot to hang out. We had to walk through a<br/>whole damn maze just to get here.')
('Aaron', "An underground colosseum and contraband as far as<br/>the eye can see... It's like it was made for me.")
('Van', "...Well, too late to do anything now that<br/>you're here.")
('Van', "I'm gonna guess people stayed away 'cause you had<br/>Elaine, but people are always gettin' into scuffles<br/>around here.")
('Van', "So let me teach you how to speak this<br/>district's language.")
('Van', "We'll take a tour while we do, but just keep your eyes<br/>peeled, all right?")
('Agnès', 'Right!')
('Feri', 'Of course!')
('Aaron', "I'm down.")
('System', 'Leave the Blacklight District and return to<br/>the surface?')
('Quatre', 'I never would have imagined there was a place like<br/>this in Edith before coming here...')
('Feri', "I'm not surprised. And is it just me, or does this<br/>district seem even more on edge than usual?")
('Risette', 'It makes sense that it would be. I imagine a number<br/>of secret agents are down here investigating after<br/>what happened.')
('Agnès', "I'd assume so, too. This may be the closest thing<br/>Edith has to a lawless district, but the authorities can't<br/>afford to turn a blind eye right now.")
('Aaron', "Well, I guess we should snoop around the shops and<br/>see if anyone's seen that reporter anywhere?")
('Van', "Yeah. Let's get movin'.<br/>(This feels like...)")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Wh-What are you doing?!')
('Agnès', 'Did you hear that?')
('Van', 'Yeah. I knew it!')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Let go of me! I said, let GO!')
(40454, 'Hmph. YOU were the one who started piling on<br/>the questions.')
(40453, 'Nothing in life comes free, young lady.')
(40451, "Now we get to enjoy our rightful reward. C'mon...")
('Van', "Someone needs to go back to Sunday School, 'cause<br/>that sure doesn't sound like the definition of 'rightful'<br/>to me.")
(40454, 'And just who the hell are you guys?')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'A-Arkride Solutions!')
('Judith', '*sigh* She really was down here...')
('Agnès', 'Are those people jaegers?')
('Feri', "I don't think so. That getup they're wearing looks<br/>familiar, though.")
('Feri', 'I think their name is Bugbear?')
('Risette', 'Ah, them. Their threat level is a mere C-.')
(40453, "H-Hey! You lookin' for a fight, lady?!")
(40451, "Man, this sucks. We were gonna take advantage of<br/>the mess Almata's made to finally get our name<br/>out there...")
(40451, "...but all this state of emergency crap has got us stuck<br/>where we are, and it's pissin' me off!")
('Aaron', "Wow. What a bunch of losers. No wonder they're<br/>called jaeger dropouts.")
('Quatre', "I'm sure they've still seen enough combat to be a<br/>problem, though.")
(40452, "Huh. I only just realized, but they've got some real<br/>lookers with 'em, too.")
(40454, "Guess we'll get to have some fun after we show 'em<br/>who's boss!")
('Van', 'Ugh. This is so dumb...')
('Feri', 'Time to take them down.')
('Aaron', 'Now that was just pathetic.')

(40452, 'Damn it! I thought these guys were just a bunch<br/>of rookies!')
(40451, 'Ugh... Fine! Have it your way!')
('Feri', 'Reinforcements coming in!')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'D-Doggies?!')
('Van', "Tch. Course they'd have military monsters at their<br/>beck and call.")
('Judith', "Mmgh... It's not going to be easy fighting off this<br/>many while defending her.")
(40453, 'Heh heh. Looks like the tables have turned, huh?')
(40454, "It figures, though. These days, Calvard's full of wusses<br/>who're so used to peace, they've forgotten how<br/>to fight.")
(40454, 'I bet Heiyue would just roll over, too. Maybe we<br/>should try getting ourselves hired by the new big boys<br/>in town!')
('Agnès', 'What?! How can you suggest that?!')
('Quatre', "Do you even understand what you're saying?!")
('Houseman', "'Heiyue would just roll over,' would they?")
(40452, '...Huh?')
('Van', 'Wait...')
('Aaron', 'G-Gien?!')
(40454, 'Argh!')
(40453, 'Ugh!')
(40453, 'Wh... Wh...')
(40454, 'What just happened?!')
('Houseman', "Well, you aren't putting up much of a fight.<br/>Perhaps you ought to consider hanging up the jaegers'<br/>uniform if you cannot act the part.")
('Agnès', 'Th-Those are...')
('Feri', "Heiyue's xiongshou!")
('Judith', "I've heard rumors, but never seen them in person...<br/>(Their strength is supposed to be comparable<br/>to hers...)")
(40458, "D-Don't be scared! We still have the upper hand<br/>in numbers!")
(40455, 'Y-Yeah! Deploy all of the military monsters—')
('Houseman', "So that you don't misunderstand, we are not the main<br/>threat you face here.")
(40455, '...What?')
('Bergard', 'MMGH!')
(40457, 'H-How...?')
(40455, 'Urk...')
('Bergard', 'That is a shame. Your prowess is sorely lacking.')
('Van', '...')
('Aaron', "...Isn't that the guy we passed on the way to Longlai?")
('Quatre', 'Oh! The one on that giant ETWS bike!')
('Bergard', 'I must apologize. I see I overdid it some.')
('Bergard', 'Though I did restrain myself...')
('Bergard', "That's a good boy. No trouble caused, no<br/>trouble faced.")
('Bergard', '...So, then, what will the rest of you be doing?')
(40455, 'E-Excuse us, sir!')
(40457, "W-We're leaving! NOW!")
('Agnès', 'Umm...')
('Judith', "Can't top real life for the best visual effects, huh...?")
('Quatre', 'He sent both man and monster flying through<br/>the air...')
('Houseman', 'I would expect no less from the famed Lion.<br/>Your strength only seems to have grown since your<br/>active days.')
('Bergard', 'Heh. I no longer go by that name, and I would<br/>very much appreciate you forgetting it.')
('Bergard', 'Thank you for leading me here, Elder.')
('Houseman', "Not at all. That wasn't the only reason I came here.")
('Houseman', "And I'm sure, with circumstances as they are, that I<br/>am going to be relying on you significantly in the days<br/>to come.")
('Bergard', 'I see...')
('Houseman', "It's good to see you all again. I hadn't expected we<br/>would meet so soon upon my arrival.")
('Aaron', "Argh... Can't believe two old codgers rolled right up<br/>and hogged all the limelight.")
('Aaron', 'B-But what are you even doing here?')
('Houseman', 'Our course of action has been decided, you see.')
('Houseman', "Heiyue's response to currently unfolding events.")
('Aaron', '...')
('Risette', 'So your preparations are complete, then.')
('Houseman', 'Indeed. The mists have cleared, and we have exactly<br/>the number of pieces that we require.')
('Houseman', 'Until the matter has been fully resolved, we will also<br/>be assuming control of the Blacklight District.')
('Houseman', "That is in accordance with our agreement with this<br/>nation's supreme authority.")
('Agnès', '...!')
('Feri', 'Then the president signed off on this?')
('Judith', "And what do you mean by 'the mists have cleared'?")
('Houseman', "Heh. It's time you decided your next move—though I<br/>would suggest you listen to what my friend here has<br/>to say before doing so.")
('Houseman', 'Farewell for now, Aaron. I will be in touch.')
('Aaron', 'H-Hey!')
('Aaron', "Man... Didn't think he'd come all this way in person.")
('Aaron', "Fan's probably still in Langport, but now I really<br/>wanna know what the 'pieces' he mentioned refer to.")
('Agnès', '...Are you all right, Van?')
('Van', "...Yep. This is him, all right. This is how he's<br/>always been.")
('Van', 'He looks normal on the surface, yet everything he<br/>does is batshit crazy.')
('Van', "Like wanderin' off with some stupid-dangerous<br/>object back when he was younger.")
('Bergard', 'Haha! That certainly brings back memories.')
('Bergard', 'Yet I have discarded my past now, and I would ask<br/>that you discard it as well...')
('Bergard', '...my old greenhorn student, Van.')
('Quatre', "This is Van's former master? The one he said was like<br/>a father to him?!")
('Feri', "Umm... But wasn't he...?")
('Van', "I've got more to say than there are stars in the sky, but<br/>let me start with this:")
('Van', 'Why are you still alive when you supposedly<br/>died three years ago, Master Barkhorn?!')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "I'm so sorry for all the trouble I caused you.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "I'm such an idiot... I just got tunnel vision and let<br/>myself get all carried away.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "*sniffle* Dingo always warned me about this, but look<br/>at me—I haven't learned a thing...")
('Agnès', 'Marielle...')
('Van', "...Well, I ain't gonna tell you not to push<br/>the envelope. That's in a reporter's job description.")
('Van', "Just make sure you don't forget what Dingo said.")
('Van', "'Think about what you can do, and what you want<br/>to do.'")
('Van', "'You'll find a clue on how to move forward in the gap<br/>between the two.'")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', '...')
('Van', '...He used to tell me that a lot back when we<br/>first met.')
('Van', "As long as you don't stop thinkin', there's gonna be a<br/>way to bridge that gap. You just gotta find it.")
('Van', "We're working on his last request right now.")
('Van', "We won't be able to do it alone, but we're plannin' to<br/>make up for our shortcomings with help from others.")
('Van', "Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if that brought us to you<br/>before long. We'll need help from more than<br/>shady folks.")
('Van', "So keep your head high, and let's all do the jobs we're<br/>best for—if nothin' else than to prove his words right.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "...Right! I don't know how much of a contribution I'll<br/>be able to make...")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "...but I'll start being more mindful of my cans and<br/>wants—and I'll do it while finding a way to<br/>move forward!")
('System', 'They made their way across the underground railway<br/>tracks, fortunately encountering no more devils as<br/>they did.')
('System', 'Before long, they arrived in the Blacklight District.')
('Feri', 'There are lots of colored lines here, too...')
('Aaron', "Yeah, but notice how there's a good amount of people<br/>who aren't frozen. This area's in better shape than the<br/>surface, looks like.")
('Risette', 'I imagine many of them deliberately came here from<br/>the surface believing it to be safer.')
('Van', 'Would be a smart move.')
('Van', "(I don't recognize either of those guys. Must be<br/>new here.)")
('Van', "(The only people who're moving around are people I<br/>remember seein' at some point before.)")
(40451, "I-It's you guys!")
('Feri', "Hmm... I feel like we've seen you somewhere before...")
('Risette', 'They were the men Mr. Zeman trounced effortlessly<br/>when they were causing trouble for Ms. Aymé.')
('Aaron', 'Yeah, along with Gien and his xiongshou.')
('Aaron', 'They got owned so fast, I forgot all about them.')
('Fie', 'I think their name is Bugbear?<br/>(I vaguely remember us running into them back when<br/>I was in school.)')

('Van', "Ugh. Why couldn't you guys just be frozen, too?")
(40451, "'U-Ugh,' yourself! You don't have to be so rude<br/>every time!")
(40452, "I thought we could finally rest easy now that we're<br/>away from all the chaos on the surface, but we HAD<br/>to run into you guys.")
(40453, "I see you're traveling in smaller numbers these<br/>days, spriggan.")
(40454, "Something tells me they've got info we could do<br/>with having. Time to put the screws to 'em!")
('Feri', '...')
('Aaron', '*sigh* Can you dumbasses really not tell when the<br/>odds are stacked against you?')
('Bergard', "Heh. I've been waiting for your arrival.")
(40451, 'AAARGH!')
(40453, 'GAAAH!')
(40455, "H-He's baaaaaack!")
(40454, "I-It's that crazy old guy again!")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "I'm not entirely opposed to vulgarities, but such<br/>foolishness is downright repulsive.")
(40454, 'Wh...?')
(40455, 'What the—?!')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'I do so appreciate how lowlifes like these help us<br/>cream of the crop stand out.')
(40460, '...Huh?')
(40461, 'Oh... Oh, no...')
('Van', "I knew you were gonna turn up here, but I didn't<br/>expect you to make a whole show of it.")
('Fie', 'Looks like some strong guys on guard here.')
('Kincaid', 'I see there are some formidable allies guarding<br/>the place.')
('Cao', 'I see we have some formidable allies here.')
('Feri', 'You put a stop to them just like that...')
('Aaron', "You could've at least let them THINK they had a<br/>chance of winning.")
('Bergard', 'Well, we may not have been counting on their arrival,<br/>but we suspected it was about time for yours.')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'That CID aide and the White Orchid Dragon arrived<br/>not long ago, too.')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'Claussell and the White Orchid Dragon arrived not<br/>long ago, too.')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'Claussell and that CID aide arrived not long ago, too.')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'They informed us of what you were up to.')
('Van', 'Then that makes things easy.')
('Risette', 'So the two of them passed through here as well, then.')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'Ellroy also filled me in on our current predicament.')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "It sounds like it's quite the mess—but why not let the<br/>mess wait and indulge yourselves with a good<br/>rest first?")
('Van', "Of course you'd say that...")
('Van', "Anyway, the Oathbreaker's a given, but did the<br/>Direwolf and the Immovable stop by before all this<br/>went down?")
('Fie', 'I was expecting Zin to be here.')
('Kincaid', "I'd heard we could expect some other surprising<br/>faces here.")
('Cao', 'Hmm... I had heard we could expect some other<br/>surprising faces here.')
('Bergard', 'Zin and the Direwolf were here not long ago, but<br/>they have since returned to the surface.')
('Bergard', 'Ashladd and the shinobi of Ikaruga have<br/>also departed.')
('Bergard', 'We do have some other unexpected guests in their<br/>place, however.')

('Van', "President Rocksmith! That's some party you've got<br/>with you.")
('Aaron', 'I knew Gotti was gonna be around, but...')
('Director Gotti', "Gahaha! Good to see you guys! Hear the surface's<br/>gone down the shitter!")
('Fie', "I thought you were in the Seiden District. I'm glad<br/>you're okay.")
('Kilika', 'Heh. You as well.')
('Kincaid', "I'm glad to see the both of you are faring well.")
('Kincaid', 'And you also, of course, Mr. President.')
('Kilika', 'Heh. The same to you, Kincaid.')
('Warrant Officer Cody', "...It's good to see you, sir.")
('Cao', "Well, well... I'm relieved to see you're all right.")
('Kilika', "Heh. Same to you—not that there's anything in<br/>this world capable of taking you out.")
('Rocksmith', 'I decided to make my way here after I finished talking<br/>with Fan and the crown prince.')
('Rocksmith', "I've heard that this place has changed quite a bit since<br/>I held my position, so I've been meaning to revisit it<br/>for some time.")
('Director Gotti', "And I see why you'd want to come, Mr. President!")
('Director Gotti', 'The rotten air of this dirty, dingy hellscape STINKS<br/>of magnifical eros and savagery!')
('Director Gotti', "Oh, pinch me, Aidios! I'm already DYING to film<br/>something here!")
('Aaron', 'How is this guy so predictable...?')
('Van', "I'd be more concerned if he changed overnight.")
('Feri', "...What does 'eros' mean?")
('Risette', "That's a word you need not concern yourself with for<br/>a while, Ms. Al-Fayed.")
('Bergard', 'Well, then, how about we take a seat over there for<br/>the time being?')
('Van', 'So this originated in the Vantail District after all.')
('Bergard', 'Indeed—no doubt as a result of what we saw in<br/>that transmission.')
('Rocksmith', "I wasn't able to see it myself, and so I've had to rely<br/>on hearsay...")
('Rocksmith', "...but I hear that Almata's missing executive member<br/>and their deceased leader made an appearance?")
('Van', "...Yeah. There's no guarantee it's really them, but<br/>there's a good chance it is.")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "You witnessed Dantès' death firsthand, didn't<br/>you, Master?")
('Bergard', 'I did. He should most certainly be dead after what<br/>he endured.')
('Bergard', 'As such, I would ordinarily suspect that some manner<br/>of trickery is at work here. Ordinarily.')
('Fie', "He wasn't the only deceased Almata member<br/>there, either...")
('Kincaid', "He wasn't the only deceased Almata member<br/>there, either...")
('Cao', "He wasn't the only deceased Almata member<br/>there, either.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "We're without a doubt dealing with something far<br/>from ordinary here.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'I heard that people came back from the dead during<br/>the chaos in the Empire two years ago, too.')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "And as it so happens, weren't you one of them?")
('Bergard', "...I was only believed to be dead. My situation is<br/>fundamentally different to that of the<br/>Empire's Immortals.")
('Van', "I wasn't part of all that, but from what I've heard, that<br/>was tied up in a curse specific to the Empire.")
('Van', "The being responsible for it is dead and gone, too.<br/>We shouldn't have to deal with Immortals again.")
('Van', "...Not sure why I'm even tellin' you this. You probably<br/>know way more about the whole thing than I do.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "Heehee. Aren't you a bright boy?")
('Kilika', "It sounds like they're unrelated to the Empire's<br/>troubles, then, whether they are the actual Almata<br/>members living again or impostors.")
('Kilika', 'Though you seem to have your own theory as to what<br/>is at work here, Mr. Arkride.')
('Van', '...')
('Feri', '(After what happened with Aida...)')
('Risette', "(It isn't impossible that this is the work of<br/>a Genesis...)")
('Aaron', "(Yeah. It's too early to say for sure, though.)")
('Fie', 'Hmm...')
('Kincaid', '...')
('Cao', 'Hmm...')
('Director Gotti', 'Almata did do some crazy mindbending stuff<br/>in Tharbad.')
('Director Gotti', "So I think we can safely say that common sense<br/>doesn't always apply to them.")
('Rocksmith', 'Yet it seems the only way to find out the truth now is<br/>to charge right into the matter and find it.')
('Rocksmith', 'Is that your thinking also, Arkride?')
('Van', 'It is. I was the one who dealt the killing blow to<br/>Dantès in Oración.')
('Van', "It wasn't 'cause I didn't have a choice. And it wasn't<br/>to avenge a friend.")
('Van', "No, he'd just gone too far off the rails—and as a<br/>spriggan, I couldn't let him go one step further.")
('Van', 'So finding out the truth is on me now.')
('Van', "Because I don't believe in leaving any job half done.")
('Rocksmith', 'Very well, then.')
('Fie', 'Heh.')
('Kincaid', 'Heh.')
('Cao', 'Heh.')
('Kilika', 'The CID has no opposition to that.')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', '...')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'Heehee...')
('Feri', "We've had plenty of run-ins with Almata in<br/>the past...")
('Feri', "We're not gonna turn back now!")
('Aaron', "Nope. After what they did to my bros, I'm not gonna<br/>stop until they're gone for good.")
('Risette', "As a concierge, it is my job to intercept and<br/>mitigate potential risks, and that is just what<br/>I'll do.")
('Risette', 'We also still have to find Ms. Claudel, Mr. Salision,<br/>and Ms. Lanster to ask for their input on<br/>our next move.')
('Feri', "Absolutely! We can't make a decision without them!")
('Aaron', "Miss Perfect's got her big-brained friend with her, so<br/>I'm sure she's sitting pretty, at least.")
('Van', "Judith's not even one of my part-timers...")
('Van', "Though I guess that's technically true for my<br/>master, too.")
('Bergard', 'It may be, but rest assured I will be accompanying you<br/>till the very end.')
('Bergard', "We need to bring Victor's family home safely as well.")
('Feri', "Yeah! We can't forget about Yumé and Paulette!")
('Aaron', 'And that useless racecar driver, but he can just rot out<br/>there for all I care.')
('Risette', 'That is rather harsh...')
('Rocksmith', "It sounds like there's nothing more that needs to<br/>be said. Go on, then, and follow your hearts.")
('Rocksmith', 'It would do mine good to see that young Agnès is<br/>safe and well.')
('Van', "She was headin' to Tyrell, so as soon as we're ready,<br/>we should head there next.")
('Van', "Can't say I'm not curious what her dad's up to, too.")
('Rocksmith', "Hmm... Indeed. I'm sure he's fine wherever he is,<br/>of course.")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'Well, with that out of the way, I also have something<br/>I would like to discuss.')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'I have no specific problem with our master<br/>accompanying you on your travels.')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'That being said, Mr. Van Arkride...')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'While I am aware that your group is handling some<br/>peculiar items that have their share of<br/>interesting effects...')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "...you wouldn't happen to have any other ideas on<br/>what could be causing all of this, would you?")
('Van', '...!')
('Feri', 'Huh?')
('Aaron', 'What do you mean? ...Wait a sec.')
('Risette', '...')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "While unofficial and known only to a select few,<br/>there just so happens to be a word in the church's<br/>lexicon that refers to what we are seeing.")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'Specifically, to the state of devils descending upon the<br/>real world and bringing about chaos.')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "Isn't that right, Master Bergard?")
('Bergard', 'You are correct. Only those involved with the darker<br/>side of the church will ever come into contact<br/>with it...')
('Bergard', "...but Edith is currently in a state of what we would<br/>call 'Pandemonium.'")
('Van', '...')
('Feri', 'Pandemonium...')
('Aaron', 'Never heard that one before.')
('Risette', 'Neither have I, but it has a chilling ring to it.')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "It's mentioned in a text called the Book of Ezer.")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "It's an Apocrypha that only members of the<br/>Gralsritter, Iscariot, and chosen others are permitted<br/>to read.")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "For good reason, too. It's a book that eats away at the<br/>reader's soul the longer they peruse it.")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "Now, forgive me if I'm wrong, but might you have<br/>been one of its perusers at some point?")
('Van', 'Well...')
('Van', '...')
('Feri', 'Van...')
('Aaron', 'Was this after you quit school? Or...')
('Risette', '...')
('Director Gotti', "You kinda lost me near the start of all that, but your<br/>only problem's that Van read some banned<br/>book, right?")
('Director Gotti', "What's the big deal with reading a banned book<br/>or two? I've got mountains of 'em hidden away—<br/>some real juicy ones, too!")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "I-It isn't quite that simple—")
('Director Gotti', 'Oh, I think it is!')
('Director Gotti', "I know Van. I know he's a man's man with a good<br/>head on his shoulders and a burning passion for all<br/>that's right.")
('Director Gotti', "Hell, I'd be happy to appoint him the successor of my<br/>'Gotti Spirit' if anything ever happened to me!")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'Oh, my.')
('Van', "'Preciate the support, really, but I dunno if I'm<br/>THAT much like you, Director.")
('Director Gotti', "You're a smart one, too—which is why I thought<br/>you'd be able to see him beyond your personal bias.")
('Director Gotti', "A real man follows his eyes and his heart! He doesn't<br/>let his position blindly turn him into some<br/>prejudicial schmuck.")
('Director Gotti', 'Got a counter to that, Leon?')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', '...')
('Van', 'Director...')
('Bergard', 'Heh.')
('Aaron', 'What the hell kinda logic is that?')
('Feri', "I don't know what you said, but it sounded really cool!")
('Risette', 'It displeases all of us at Arkride Solutions to see our<br/>boss be dismissed over these personal biases, too.')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "You're right, I admit it. I don't know Arkride<br/>very well.")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "I've also had a negative image of him since before we<br/>even met.")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "Specifically, that he was an irritating little dandiprat<br/>who gave my master six months of headaches when<br/>he's not even part of the church.")
('Van', 'Hey! ...I mean, yeah, but...')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "Either way, in deference to the director's words, I<br/>won't push this subject any further.")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'You seem to have your own concerns about what is<br/>happening as it is.')
('Van', '...')
('Van', "We're the same age, right? Kinda crazy to me that<br/>you're a Gralsritter.")
('Van', "But don't worry. I know I'm a pain, but I don't plan<br/>on causin' as much trouble as you're fearing.")
('Van', "The last thing I'd want is to soil our master's good<br/>name by bein' hunted down after bein' branded<br/>a heretic.")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', '...Ha. Unbelievable. You really are disturbingly<br/>well informed.')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'Very well. As students under the same master, I will<br/>be counting on you, Van.')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'My work requires me to stay here for a while longer...')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', '...but should you run into Celis on the outside, then<br/>please give her my regards.')
('Van', 'Yeah. Will do.')
('Van', "With devils for days in the capital right now, we're<br/>gonna need you guys big time.")
('Van', "So here's hopin' we can put our differences aside—at<br/>least until this is over.")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'Heh. I can give it some thought, I suppose.')
('Director Gotti', "That's what I like to see! Bromances are a bond<br/>forged through sweat and tears! Speaking of sweat,<br/>who's up for a talk about sweating it up while fu—")
('Kilika', "Mr. Director, I would VERY much like to hear about<br/>those 'mountains of banned books' you profess<br/>to have.")
('Director Gotti', 'Erk...')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'Heehee. I have to admit, my interest is piqued.')
('Warrant Officer Cody', "My head's starting to hurt...")
('Rocksmith', 'Hahaha! Go easy on him, now, Kilika.')
('Aaron', 'Ugh...')
('Feri', 'Oh! Are you jealous?')
('Aaron', 'Like hell I am!')
('Risette', 'It appears we can now finally move forward.')
('Bergard', 'That we can. You have my appreciation for helping<br/>them in my absence.')
('Fie', "I'm glad I was able to help—'cause they helped<br/>me, too.")
('Fie', "Things are still looking grim, but it feels like there's at<br/>least light at the end of the tunnel now.")
('Feri', 'I feel the same way!')
('Kincaid', 'Not at all. I should be the one thanking you.')
('Kincaid', "Van and I go back a long time, and you've done much<br/>for my younger brother in times when I could<br/>do nothing.")
('Risette', 'Mr. Kincaid...')
('Cao', 'Not at all. I chose to travel with them in part due to<br/>my own curiosity.')
('Cao', "I enjoy seeing promising young people develop, even<br/>if they aren't part of Heiyue.")
('Aaron', 'Sounds about right for you.')
('System', 'Fie left for the northern part of the city, saying that<br/>she was going to resume her activities as a bracer.')
('System', 'Kincaid left for the northern part of the city, saying<br/>that he had another task to attend to.')
('System', 'Cao left for the northern part of the city, saying that<br/>he was going to resume his work as part of Heiyue.')
('System', 'With Bergard taking their place, they then readied<br/>themselves to continue their mission.')
('Van', "Well, there were some surprises along the way, but<br/>we've got our next objective now.")
('Van', "So as soon as we're ready, we should make for the<br/>Tyrell District.")
('Feri', 'Right! Agnès should be there waiting for us.')
('Aaron', 'Everything here seems to be mostly how I<br/>remembered it, so it should be a good place to<br/>stock up.')
('Bergard', 'Indeed. The northern part of the city is crawling with<br/>devils—we should prepare carefully before we depart.')
('Risette', 'That door is the exit we want, I assume?')
('Van', "Yeah. Kind of a maze on the other side, but there's a<br/>path that'll lead us directly to the Tyrell District.")
('Feri', "Well, let's get to work!")
('System', 'Bergard rejoined the party, and Fie left the party.')
('System', 'Bergard rejoined the party, and Kincaid left the party.')
('System', 'Bergard rejoined the party, and Cao left the party.')
('Zin the Immovable', "And that's how it's done.")
('Van', 'Almost feel sorry for the bastards in hindsight.<br/>Almost.')
('Van', "Gotta be pretty wet behind the ears to pick a fight<br/>with the Immovable and not know what they're<br/>gettin' into.")
('Van', "Goes to show why the Taito School's still got its rep.")
('Zin the Immovable', "It's lost some of its luster from back in the day, alas.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'The central dojo closed down ten years ago after<br/>Master Ryuga passed.')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Now it hangs on by a thread, split between several<br/>disparate dojos.')
('Van', "(Speakin' of those...)")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Hmm? Got something on your mind?')
('Van', 'I remember you liked to go visit those rinky-dink<br/>dojos every now and then to train with the disciples.')
('Van', 'Why not take up the mantle and revive the Taito<br/>School outright? You ever think of doing that?')
('Van', "Can't imagine anyone would have a problem with you<br/>takin' the reins.")
('Zin the Immovable', "I'd love to see that as much as anyone, believe me, but<br/>I don't think I'm cut out to lead the whole school<br/>like that.")
('Zin the Immovable', "And I can't just shirk my duty as a bracer to chase<br/>some pipe dream of mine.")
('Zin the Immovable', "Maybe once I'm retired, I'll give it some thought.")
('Van', "True. Guild probably can't afford to lose somebody as<br/>high up as you.")
('Van', "Given everything goin' on right now... Yeah.")
('Zin the Immovable', "You flatter me. I can't take all the credit, though—<br/>you really held your own in that fight back there.")
('Zin the Immovable', "You've got a lot of oddball moves in your arsenal.<br/>I can tell you're trained in Kunlun, clear as day.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Must have a hell of a master to be able to fight<br/>like that.')
('Van', 'Heh. Hell of a master is right—he went and wasted<br/>his talent on a punk ass like me.')
('Van', "Couldn't even repay him for everything he did.")
('Zin the Immovable', "Ah, you don't say?<br/>(Could he mean...?)")
('Zin the Immovable', "Anyway, let's keep moving. Our destination should be<br/>further in.")
('Van', "I'm sure you guys've figured it out, but the Blacklight<br/>District ain't exactly the kind of place you visit<br/>for fun.")
('Van', "Aaron's another story, but the rest of you make easy<br/>pickings for scumbags and lowlifes hackin' it<br/>down here.")
('Van', "You don't come down here by yourselves, understood?")
('Feri', 'Yeah, I get what you mean. Things can get really<br/>dicey if you get surrounded here...')
('Feri', "...but if you bring a buddy along, I bet it'd make for a<br/>fun fight!")
('Agnès', "Well, ideally, you won't be fighting in a city at all...")
('Agnès', "Still, I didn't realize there were so many people like<br/>that down here.")
('Van', "Yup. Pretty spooky when you think about it—this<br/>world here's a lot closer to yours than you might be<br/>comfortable with.")
('Agnès', "It is, but...honestly, I'm just more surprised this all<br/>existed right under my nose.")
('Agnès', "At least, it's surprising to someone as well-to-do<br/>as me. Perhaps I'm just not very aware of<br/>my surroundings.")
('Agnès', "You'd think this would be something of a problem,<br/>but it's like everyone just turns a blind eye to it...")
('Van', "I hear ya. Blacklight's a lawless place, but they have<br/>their own rules instead.")
('Van', "The big one being, you don't drag innocent civilians<br/>into your messes down here.")
('Van', "Most tend to follow that, so they'll leave you alone...<br/>Keyword bein' most.")
('Van', "Some of 'em step outta line, like we just saw.")
('Aaron', "Reminds me of Heiyue's own code.")
('Risette', 'Do you visit here often, Mr. Arkride? You seem to be<br/>rather well informed about this area.')
('Van', "I check in from time to time. There's intel down here<br/>that you can't find anywhere else.")
('Van', "And as you guys might've noticed by now, it's a good<br/>place to sharpen your street smarts.")
('Feri', "Yeah, I totally get what you mean. That's gotta be<br/>like the best part of this whole trip!")
('Van', "...Man. Jaeger born and bred, ain'tcha?")
('Feri', "Oh, cool! There's a match going on right now!")
('Aaron', 'This some kind of arena? Nice.')
('Van', "Yup. This here's where they hold fightin'<br/>tournaments—you go in and beat the shit out of<br/>each other.")
('Van', "Makes for a gamblin' hotbed, as you can imagine.")
('Aaron', 'Oh? Color me intrigued.')
('Feri', "Wow, that's awesome! Sounds like an amazing place<br/>to train!")
('Van', "Yeah, no. Literally ANYTHING goes in there—<br/>roids, mods, explosives, you name it. It ain't the place<br/>to train.")
('Van', "It's straight-up bloodsport in there. The organizers'll<br/>even come up with bullshit reasons to make you fight<br/>monsters and archaisms.")
('Van', "Even if you survive all the shit they throw at you, it<br/>really ain't worth it. Just steer clear of it, all right?")
('Feri', "That's fair. Sounds like you really have to be on your<br/>toes in there...")
('Van', "Pretty decent prize money if you win, though. I'll give<br/>'em that much credit. It's one way to make ends meet<br/>down here.")
('Risette', "Mr. Arkride, you're not speaking from experience, are<br/>you...?")
('Van', "Nah, that shit ain't my scene... Well, not anymore,<br/>I mean...")
('Van', "...Look, they were hard times, okay?! That bastard<br/>paid for a new truck, but he didn't pay for all the<br/>mods like the previous one had!")
('Aaron', 'Whatever you say, chief. Next time you decide to<br/>enter, let me know so I can put my money on you.')
('Van', "Hell no, I ain't settin' foot in that cesspit again!")
('Agnès', "Oh, you know what I just realized? We haven't<br/>checked any bulletin boards here.")
('Van', "Don't sweat that. As a rule, I don't take 4SPGs from<br/>anybody down here.")
('Feri', "Why not? There are a lot of people here who could<br/>use some help, aren't there?")
('Aaron', "For real. Nobody down here's exactly innocent, so<br/>I can't imagine any of them being able to go to<br/>the cops or bracers for help.")
('Van', "That's the problem. There are some rare exceptions,<br/>but almost everyone down here has a checkered past<br/>in some way.")
('Van', "Ultimately, I can't trust 'em not to abuse the<br/>system. Worst case scenario, I get farmed out as<br/>a grunt for some real sketchy shit. Not worth it.")
('Risette', "That does make sense, given spriggans' reputation for<br/>assisting in legally gray matters.")
('Risette', 'I can see how a bad faith actor might exploit them for<br/>their own gain—and how society at large would offer<br/>little to defend them.')
('Van', 'To be clear, I already make a point of filtering out<br/>those garbage posts to start with.')
('Van', "More than anything else, it'd just be a giant time sink<br/>trying to vet requests from these parts. That's the<br/>biggest reason I don't bother.")
('Van', "As much as some folks might think otherwise, I don't<br/>deal with criminals. I deal with people who have<br/>complicated problems.")
('Van', "When somebody has a problem they can't rely on the<br/>law or the guild to solve, they come to me. That's all<br/>there is to it.")
('Feri', "That's Van for you!")
('Van', "What can I say? It's worked for me so far. Must be<br/>doin' somethin' right.")
('Van', "End of the day, if someone here really wants my<br/>services, they're not completely out of luck.<br/>They've still got two options.")
('Van', 'They can post a 4SPG in another part of town, or<br/>they can come talk to me. Same as anybody<br/>else, really.')
('Van', "Doesn't mean I'll agree to help, but I'll hear 'em out,<br/>at least.")
('Agnès', "Heehee. That's our boss, always trying to keep the<br/>door open.")
('Aaron', "Huh? Everybody's scared shitless here... What's<br/>going on?")
('Feri', 'Look over there!')
('Bergard', 'They have all fainted.')
('Van', "They're all knocked out.")
('Agnès', "What the...? What could've happened?")
('Van', 'Oh, I think I might know. Got a hunch these fools<br/>tried barking up the wrong tree...and they paid<br/>the price. Hard.')
('Aaron', 'Oh, shit.')
('Feri', 'That would explain it.')
('Judith', "Well, I'd say they had it coming, then.")
('Quatre', 'I almost feel sorry for them...')
('Risette', "If anything, they're lucky to have gotten off so lightly.")
('Prince Sherid', 'Van, my friend! How wonderful to see you. And the<br/>rest of you, as well!')
('Van', 'Good to see you, Your Highness. You sure roughed<br/>those poor bastards up good, huh?')
('Prince Sherid', 'Oh, I had no hand in this. None whatsoever!')
('Prince Sherid', "You see, they attempted to make moves on these<br/>ladies here—and they just wouldn't take no for<br/>an answer. They got physical, and...well.")
('Prince Sherid', "These women, they're truly a force to be<br/>reckoned with. Even yours truly quivers before them!")
('Rixia', 'Er...')
('Shizuna', "Hey, don't you think that's a little mean, Prince?")
('Naje', 'I was simply performing my duties. Nothing more,<br/>and nothing less.')
('Aaron', "Okay, but that doesn't explain why you all were<br/>hanging out. You guys make for one weird posse,<br/>however you slice it.")
('Rixia', 'A mutual acquaintance of ours was kind enough to<br/>put me in touch with His Highness, so I came down<br/>here to meet with him. But then...')
('Naje', 'As fate would have it, she happened to run into us<br/>here as well.')
('Shizuna', "I'm on a break for once after wrapping up a job.<br/>I came into town to unwind until the festival, take in<br/>some of the local sights.")
('Shizuna', 'Anyway, I wandered down here looking for a little...<br/>excitement, I guess you could say.')
('Shizuna', 'And I got everything I bargained for and more!')
('Shizuna', "This is too good to just be some kind of coincidence.<br/>Destiny must've brought us together. What do you<br/>say, Yin, Ms. Bodyguard? Want to go a round?")
('Rixia', "I... I think I'm good, thank—")
('Prince Sherid', "Well, that sounds like a delightful proposal!<br/>Don't worry about me, Naje. I encourage—nay,<br/>IMPLORE you to take her up on it!")
('Naje', '*sigh* The things you say sometimes,<br/>Your Highness...')
('Naje', "I suppose I should just be grateful you're not thinking<br/>to throw down with her yourself.")
('Shizuna', "Oh, didn't mean to leave you all out, Van! You guys<br/>are more than welcome to—")
('Van', 'Yeah, no. We have this thing called work—strange,<br/>I know.')
('Van', "(Damned if I'm gettin' caught in the crossfire<br/>between those two. That ain't the kind of threesome<br/>I'm into.)")
('Shizuna', "Aww, you're no fun... Oh, well! There's always<br/>next time!")
('Van', "Just don't burn the whole district down, all right?")
('Agnès', "What's going on? Why does everyone look so...afraid?")
('Feri', 'Huh? Why do all these people look so scared?')
('Aaron', "Huh. Something's got everybody scared shitless...")
('Risette', 'Everyone here looks to be afraid of something...or<br/>someone, perhaps.')
('Quatre', "Something feels really off... Everyone's on pins and<br/>needles here, and I'm not sure why.")
('Judith', "What's with the stage fright here? Everybody's stiff as<br/>a board...")
('Bergard', 'Strange... I can practically smell the fear from<br/>these people.')
('Van', "I'm gettin' déjà vu here...")
('Van', "Oh, hey, Master. Didn't realize you were here.<br/>Hey, you got any idea what all this hubbub's about?")
('Bergard', 'I believe your answer lies over there.')
('Van', "Oh, Aidios. I figured it was something along those<br/>lines—hopin' it wouldn't be THAT extreme, but,<br/>well, Blacklight.")
('Bergard', "I have no idea what they're planning to do, but I can't<br/>just stand idly by and watch.")
('Van', "Yeah, I'd really rather keep my distance, but I don't<br/>think we can here. Let's move.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "C'mon! Let's get this show on the road, already!<br/>You're wasting a good opportunity otherwise.<br/>When else will we all meet like this, huh?")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'You make a fine point. Truly, the stars must have<br/>aligned to direct us all here.')
('Shizuna', 'Shall we pick up where we left off at the big<br/>game, then?')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Well, no stopping this now.')
('Van', "The hell there isn't!")
('Van', "Hey! Cut that shit out! You're chokin' the whole<br/>street with all this chi you guys're puttin' out!")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'Ah. So very good to see you again, darling.')
('Walter the Direwolf', "Piss off, spriggan. You expect me to pay attention to<br/>those nobodies? I've got bigger fish to fry over here!")
('Shizuna', 'Oooh, perfect timing! You guys should hop in and<br/>join the fun, too! What do you say?')
('Van', 'Do I LOOK like I wanna get my face rearranged?<br/>Yeah, I thought not.')
('Van', "And you! You're a bracer, for cryin' out loud!<br/>What're you doing, eggin' 'em on?!")
('Zin the Immovable', "Look, I'm not gonna contest that, Van, but look at<br/>these guys. Do I look like I can hold them all off<br/>by myself?")
('Agnès', 'Well...')
('Feri', 'Er...')
('Aaron', '...Yeah, no. Not happening.')
('Risette', 'I would assume not.')
('Quatre', 'Well...no.')
('Judith', "I...wouldn't hold my breath, yeah.")
('Van', '*sigh*')
('Zin the Immovable', 'So, yeah. If this is gonna happen, we might as well<br/>take it down here and contain the spread.')
('Zin the Immovable', "If there's any part of Edith that can shake off a street<br/>fight, it's this place.")
('Van', "...Okay, I'll give you that, but still.")
('Bergard', 'Even here, collateral damage is all but inevitable.<br/>All hell will break loose once that first punch is<br/>thrown, whether you intend for it or not.')
('Bergard', 'Why not take the fight to the colosseum, instead?<br/>A purpose-built arena should prove a suitable place<br/>for a two-on-two match.')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Hmm... The man does have a point.')
('Shizuna', "Agreed. I say we take up the Roaring<br/>Lion's suggestion.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "I don't care where we fight. Let's just get this show<br/>on the road, already! We'll draw lots to come up with<br/>the teams. Everyone good with that?")
('System', "Following Bergard's suggestion, the four stepped into<br/>the arena and drew lots to determine the two sides.")
('Shizuna', "So I'm with the Immovable, eh? Heehee... Now, this<br/>should be fun.")
('Zin the Immovable', "It's an honor and pleasure, Silverblade.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Heh. Enjoy the company while you can, 'cause I'm<br/>tearing you both down! Now stop yappin' and start—")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'Now wait just a minute, Walter, dear.')
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Oh, what?')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'Does this not remind you of our day out in Oración?<br/>This team seems rather...stale to me.')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "It's not every day we get an opportunity like this.<br/>What say you we devise a different matchup?")
('Van', 'So...what? You guys wanna draw lots again?')
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Oh, for crying out... Okay, fine. Here we go again...')
('Shizuna', 'Well, this is certainly different.')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'Heehee... Now, THIS, I like. This ought to make for<br/>a better match.')
('Shizuna', "You two were both Taito School disciples back in the<br/>day, weren't you? Can't wait to see what those fists<br/>can do at their very pinnacle!")
('Walter the Direwolf', '...Are you SERIOUSLY tryna get me to team up<br/>with him? You dense?!')
('Zin the Immovable', "For once, I agree with my cantankerous 'friend' here.<br/>Sorry, but we're gonna have to veto this one.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "Oh, hush. I can't believe you two... Fully grown, and<br/>you're still bickering like children? Please, it's only for<br/>one match.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Can it! I don't give a rat's ass what you have to say!<br/>It AIN'T happening!")
('Bergard', 'I suppose this was how it was always going to<br/>turn out.')
('System', 'Then what was the point of drawing lots...?')
('Van', 'So there was no point in drawing lots at all... *sigh*')
('Walter the Direwolf', 'THERE we go—this is more like it. Now can we get<br/>started already or what?')
('Zin the Immovable', 'I have to say, after all that, my enthusiasm for this has<br/>gone down the drain.')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "Either way, now that there's nothing to stop us...")
('Shizuna', "Let's have ourselves some fun, boys and girls!")
('Van', "And that's our cue to jet. I don't wanna be in a five<br/>arge radius once they're at it.")
('Bergard', 'You can leave if you wish. I personally am curious to<br/>see how this plays out.')
('Van', "All right, don't let me stop you, Master. See ya later.")
('Van', "Oh, but before I go, you guys? Just don't destroy the<br/>place, will you?")
('Van', "...Okay, maybe that's too much to ask. Just...<br/>Just keep it to yourselves, I guess. I'd better not hear<br/>about this up on the surface.")
('Agnès', "Y-You don't really think that could actually<br/>happen...right?")
('Feri', "Don't be silly, Van! That shouldn't happen...<br/>e-er, hopefully!")
('Aaron', "You're awfully serious about that. It's not<br/>ACTUALLY gonna happen...right?")
('Risette', 'I...would like to believe to everyone has the<br/>wherewithal to avoid such a scenario.')
('Quatre', "That... That couldn't possibly happen...right?")
('Judith', "U-Uhh... You're kidding, right, Van?<br/>...Van?")
('Director Gotti', "Hot damn! I knew this place was the talk of the town,<br/>but it's even more invigorating than I ever<br/>could've imagined!")
('Director Gotti', "Hey, you said your name was Leon? I like the cut of<br/>your jib! You've got some fine taste for such a young<br/>guy still!")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "Thank you, Mr. Director. It's an honor to hear that<br/>from the man himself, as such an avid fan of yours.")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "I've watched your whole catalogue, actually.<br/>My partner enjoys them, too—the standard cuts,<br/>at least.")
('Director Gotti', "Interesting choice of words there, my friend. Is that<br/>to say you've watched my director's cuts?")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "Of course, sir. What tasteful man wouldn't?")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "I've simply chosen not to share that with Celis.<br/>She'd fly off the handle if she ever found out.")
('Director Gotti', "Gahaha! You say that, but you're still waiting for the<br/>right time to tell her, aren't you?")
('Director Gotti', "I know how these things go, trust me! There are few<br/>things finer on the Goddess' green earth than an<br/>older woman hot and bothered!")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "Hah, I suppose so. Nothing gets past you, sir, does it?<br/>(Not that you could ever tell she's the older one from<br/>the way she acts...)")
('Director Gotti', "Gahaha! Oh, man, this is great! I'm having the time<br/>of my life here!")
('Director Gotti', "Tell you what, kid: the whole tab's on me! You<br/>guys, too! Don't be shy! C'mon, join us!")
('Ashladd', 'Well, if you insist.')
('Kurogane', 'Far be it from me to turn you down. I shall<br/>accompany you until my princess has returned.')
('Van', "Oh, great. This can only end well. And what the<br/>hell's Gotti doin' over here, anyway?")
('Beckson', "Far as I can tell, the guy tried searchin' for this place<br/>after he caught wind of it, buuut he got lost. That lad<br/>there bailed him out.")
('Beckson', "Still, that's the one and only Salvatore Gotti, eh?<br/>Think I can get him to shoot one of his famous<br/>movies here?")
('Van', "Uh, you sure that's really a good idea, shinin' a light<br/>on this joint?")
('Agnès', "Perhaps not... They're all having fun, at least.<br/>Let's just leave them be for now.")
('Feri', "They look like they're having fun. Maybe we should<br/>just leave them alone.")
('Aaron', 'Crashing their little bachelor party is just asking<br/>for trouble. Probably best we keep our distance<br/>from them.')
('Risette', "They seem to be enjoying themselves. In my view,<br/>we'd best leave them to their devices.")
('Quatre', "Who knows what'll happen if we get dragged into<br/>their orbit? We should probably just leave them be.")
('Judith', "I'm a little worried, not gonna lie—I'm not sure how<br/>they'll get back to the surface. It's a pretty rough<br/>crowd down here...")
('Judith', "...but they're tough guys themselves, I guess.<br/>They'll figure it out.")
('Bergard', "(Hmm... It's one thing to find Leon here,<br/>but Ashladd? Now, there's an unexpected twist.)")
('Bergard', "I see no reason for us to rain on their parade—let's<br/>just leave well enough alone. We can always talk to<br/>them later.")
('Clément', "You stupid bitch! You just had to run your mouth,<br/>didn't you?")
('Clément', "All you had to do was sit quietly next to me and nod<br/>your head like a good girl—everything would've been<br/>just fine!")
('Clément', "But nooo, you just HAD to run your mouth! Now all<br/>that money I could've swindled is gone! All down<br/>the drain!")
('Lulua', "How... How could you deceive a woman<br/>like Daphne? That's just horrible!")
('Lulua', "If I knew that was what you were after, I never<br/>would've gone along with any of this!")
('Clément', "News flash: I don't give a shit. You have a JOB to do,<br/>and that's all that matters, you understand?")
('Clément', 'You sucker people in with that sweet, innocent face<br/>of yours, and then I swoop in for the kill!')
('Clément', "I figured that old hag was an easy target, but nope...<br/>She's sharper than she looks.")
('Clément', "But I've still got some tricks up my sleeve... Maybe I<br/>can pull something else on her.")
('Clément', "I've got this insurance plan, and you're gonna get her<br/>to take it out for me, all right?")
('Lulua', 'Excuse me?! Why should I—')
('Clément', "Ah-ah-ah. Don't even start with me. You took on<br/>this job, and you accepted my payment.")
('Clément', "That means you're obligated to do the work,<br/>little lady. Your 'feelings' can't do the job for you.")
('Clément', "So don't you run out on our deal here, or you're<br/>gonna regret it, capisce?")
('Lulua', "I... I told you. If it's the mira you want, you can have<br/>it back. I don't care!")
('Clément', "That's not how this works. It's not about the money—<br/>it's about the DEAL. You can't just walk back the<br/>deal now that you've taken it, see?")
('Clément', "You're in it now, whether you like it or not. Now be a<br/>good girl and stop—")
('Van', 'Lemme stop you right there.')
('Lulua', 'Wh-Who are you?')
('Clément', 'Tch. The hell do you want?')
(62100, "Hahaha! Oh, NO! The hero's come to save the day!<br/>I'm just SHAKING in my boots!")
('Van', "Hero, I ain't. I'm a spriggan, and I don't give a rat's<br/>ass about that goody-two-shoes shit.")
('Van', "I'm here 'cause my client told me to fetch that girl,<br/>and that's exactly what I'm gonna do. I'm askin' you<br/>NICELY to hand her over.")
('Clément', 'Greeeat, one of you pricks. Just what I needed.')
('Clément', "Look, buddy, you're barking up the wrong tree.<br/>This girl's with us—she's not going anywhere.")
('Clément', "Now if you don't get outta my face right this instant,<br/>we've got problems.")
(62101, 'You heard the boss! Scram!')
(62102, "Aww, man. What a friggin' dumbass. Guy really<br/>thinks he can just walk up by himself and take on all<br/>of us?")
('Elaine', 'Who said he was alone?')
(62100, 'Augh!')
('Lulua', 'H-Hey, I know that face... Elaine Auclair?!')
('Clément', 'Oh, of all the goddamn times...!')
('Van', "Nice work, Elaine. I've got the girl!")
('Clément', 'H-How did you...?!')
(62100, 'What the—?!')
('Elaine', "Seyla? You shouldn't—")
('Seyla', 'Lulua! Over here!')
('Lulua', 'Seyla! Seyla, is that you?!')
(62101, "Urk... You're not getting away, you little—")
('Van', 'Whoopsie there. Forget about me already, pal?')
('Elaine', "Run, you two! We'll take care of these guys!")
('Lulua', 'O-Okay! Thank you!')
(62102, 'Are you...SHITTING me...?!')
('Van', 'You want some more? Looks like you guys dunno<br/>when to stay down.')
('Elaine', "Put your hands up and surrender yourselves!<br/>You're only digging yourselves deeper!")
('Clément', 'For the love of... Seriously? A bracer AND a spriggan<br/>ganging up on me? This shit blows...')
('Clément', 'What are you doing?! Did I say you could just<br/>lie there? DID I?! Get your asses up and<br/>GET THEM!')
(62100, 'Y-Yeah, okay!')
(62101, "You guys're gonna be real sorry!")
('Van', "Jig's up, pal. You're the only one left standin'.")
('Clément', 'Eep! I... M-Mercy! Mercy, please!')
('Elaine', "Of course. I'm taking you to the guild.")
('Elaine', 'You have a lot to answer for—your crimes here AND<br/>your relationship with A. Do I make myself clear?')
('Clément', 'A-Anything but that...!')
('Van', "Oh. So he was workin' for 'em all along. That does<br/>track, yeah.")
('Van', "I'll let you handle the rest, then. Make sure the guy<br/>pays for what he's done—and pays GOOD.")
('Elaine', 'Heehee. Of course. You have a good night.')
('System', "Clément was promptly taken into the guild's custody,<br/>and made to confess his crimes.")
('System', "After looping in Daphne to the day's events, Van<br/>escorted Lulua and Seyla back to the Tyrell District.")
('System', 'Quest WithoutU completed!')
('System', 'Received')
('Mistress', "Oh, it's...you.")
('Van', "Y'know, I thought I knew you well, but I had no idea<br/>you and Dingo went so far back.")
('Van', "Level with me here: you were the one helpin' him<br/>investigate Almata's illegal adult business,<br/>weren't you?")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', '...')
('Mistress', "*sigh* Yeah, that's right. We must've worked together<br/>for...oh, a decade, I wanna say.")
('Mistress', 'We both had to keep it on the down-low in order to<br/>operate freely, though.')
('Mistress', 'He and I had known each other since we were both<br/>up in Messeldam.')
('Van', 'That long, huh? Guess that makes sense.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Umm, if you don't mind me asking, how did the two<br/>of you...you know, meet?")
('Mistress', "Oh, it wasn't anything special. He was a<br/>newly-minted intel broker...and I was your common<br/>whore, making ends meet out on the streets.")
('Mistress', "We had a nice little thing going. He'd buy<br/>information I 'coaxed' from my clients, and I'd do<br/>him some favors in kind.")
('Mistress', 'He scratched my back, I scratched his.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Huh... This is all news to me.')
('Agnès', "Can we assume that Dingo hadn't started doing any<br/>reporting work back then?")
('Mistress', 'More or less. I will say, for an errand boy working<br/>underground, he had a certain naïveté to him<br/>back then. Maybe because he was still so young.')
('Mistress', 'I had an acquaintance who worked at a local paper...<br/>I remember he was pretty intrigued about that side<br/>of things.')
('Mistress', "I'll also mention, it was eight years ago when I made<br/>the move to Edith and set up shop down here.")
('Mistress', 'But before I left, he gave me some top secret<br/>information as a parting gift. His intel and his<br/>connections have been a huge help to me.')
('Aaron', 'Heh. Leave it to the ladykiller to schmooze his way<br/>into the underground.')
('Feri', "He really helped a lot of people while he was alive,<br/>didn't he?")
('Judith', 'That he did.')
('Risette', 'Indeed...')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', '...')
('Mistress', "Later on, after everything went down in Messeldam,<br/>that's when he ended up drifting into town.")
('Mistress', 'Personally, I was happy to see him make a clean break<br/>and get into a better line of work with better people.')
('Mistress', 'Haha... You never know what life has in store for you.<br/>Maybe the Goddess took a liking to him and threw<br/>him a bone.')
('Van', '...Maybe so, yeah.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Sorry to interject, but what happened to him<br/>in Messeldam? I didn't know anything about that.")
('Mistress', "I wish I could tell you, honey, but it's not really my<br/>place to say. That all happened after I left, so I only<br/>heard things through the grapevine.")
('Mistress', "But I won't leave you empty-handed. If you're<br/>looking for his notebook, I've got some information<br/>I'd be happy to share.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Really? You'd do that?! Oh, thank you! Thank you<br/>so much!")
('Van', "Just to clarify, we're lookin' for this black leather<br/>notebook he used to carry around. You've seen it<br/>before, I take it?")
('Mistress', "Sure have. He'd been looking for a place to stash it<br/>away. I offered to hold on to it myself, but he turned<br/>me down.")
('Mistress', "Can't blame him for being so cautious when he was<br/>going up against Almata.")
('Mistress', 'But I did hear him mutter about asking someone for<br/>help on his way out of town for a piece.')
('Mistress', 'That was three days before everything went down in<br/>Creil, for reference.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', '...!')
('Feri', 'Holy cow! What timing!')
('Quatre', "On his way out of town, huh? That's rather specific...")
('Bergard', "That's a valuable clue, there.")
('Agnès', 'Actually, now that she mentions it, how DID Dingo<br/>get to Creil? Do you have any ideas, Van?')
('Van', 'He had this tiny-ass car, but he never drove it all<br/>that much. He was always paranoid of people<br/>following him.')
('Van', 'Usually he took a train or a bus when he had to go<br/>out to the sticks. Probably flew a bit from time to<br/>time, too.')
('Van', 'But I dunno what he did here...')
('Aaron', "Same. We're talking about a guy who knew all their<br/>tricks by that point—he might as well have just been<br/>moving randomly.")
('Aaron', "He sure as hell wouldn't take something as obvious as<br/>public transit—not when Almata had<br/>eyes everywhere.")
('Van', "Exactly. I think we can rule out his own car, too.<br/>That would've carried its own risks.")
('Van', "Thinkin' realistically, he probably would've...")
('Van', "(That doesn't track. He couldn't have assumed<br/>Almata didn't have eyes on rental companies and<br/>their records.)")
('Van', "(Plus, even if he HAD rented one, the cops probably<br/>would've known by now, since it would've<br/>gone unreturned.)")
('Van', '(I think we can scratch that off the list.)')
('Van', "(Y'know, ridiculous as it sounds, he probably<br/>COULD have gotten all the way out to the<br/>countryside on the back of a truck.)")
('Van', '(But if Almata found him, they very well coulda<br/>snuffed out the driver in the crossfire.)')
('Van', "(I just don't see Dingo takin' that kinda risk. He was<br/>a lot more methodical than that.)")
('Van', "(An orbal bike's pretty handy for a reporter like him—<br/>maneuverable, too.)")
('Van', "(But you stick out like a sore thumb when you're on<br/>one, with how rare they are. That's not how he<br/>did things.)")
('Van', 'I think chances are pretty good our guy took a taxi.')
('Van', "Sure as hell ain't cheap, but it'd have given him the<br/>lowest profile and the most flexibility. They blend<br/>right in on the road.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Oh! Good thinking!')
('Agnès', 'You might be on to something, Van. Taxis are pretty<br/>commonplace, especially for people heading out<br/>of town.')
('Agnès', "There's no way Almata could've been monitoring<br/>every single taxi running in Edith.")
('Judith', "So let's say he did take a taxi. What kind would he<br/>have taken? Probably one of those independent ones<br/>instead of a company taxi, right?")
('Risette', 'If that were the case, what sort of taxi would he<br/>have taken? Presumably one with a self-employed<br/>driver instead of a company, no?')
('Bergard', "Hmm... If that's what he did, he likely opted to ride<br/>with a self-employed driver rather than someone<br/>working for a company.")
('Quatre', 'That does make sense. That would have allowed him<br/>to move much more erratically, thereby throwing<br/>Almata off his trail.')
('Bergard', "That's a good point. A self-employed driver would<br/>have given him more flexibility.")
('Risette', "That's an excellent point. Hiring a self-employed<br/>driver would allow him to chart his own course<br/>and movements.")
('Mistress', 'Sounds like you guys have your next lead. I have no<br/>idea who the driver could be, unfortunately—maybe it<br/>was one of his friends.')
('Mistress', 'My guess is, he had a driver he hired on the regular—<br/>someone he could trust. That ring any bells for<br/>you, sweetheart?')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Hmm... You know something? It actually does.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'I remember Dingo would sometimes hail a taxi to get<br/>to a reporting site.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'He mostly took one that had this black and yellow<br/>checkered pattern around the bottom. The driver was<br/>an eccentric guy, too, from what I recall.')
('Feri', "Oh, wow, that's really good info! Glad you were able<br/>to remember that!")
('Van', "You said it. We'll have to look into that once we're<br/>done here.")
('Van', "Anyway, thanks for the chat, Mistress. I'll pay you<br/>back sometime.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Yes, thank you so, so much! You have no idea how<br/>grateful I am!')
('Mistress', "Oh, don't mention it, haha. I owe Dingo that much.<br/>That said, you can always repay me by coming back<br/>here to play, you know! Don't forget that! ❤")
('Mistress', "But yeah, Dingo would tell me stories about you two<br/>sometimes—the 'punk-ass spriggan' and the 'newbie<br/>reporter' he had befriended.")
('Mistress', "I do hope you're able to track down his notebook.<br/>If there's anyone out there he'd want to inherit it, I<br/>have to imagine it'd be you two.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Thank you! We'll do our best!")
('Van', "We're sure as hell gonna try. Be a waste to just let it<br/>go after doin' all this work for it.")
('Van', '(A taxi with a black and yellow checkered pattern...<br/>I know exactly which one that is. Had no idea Dingo<br/>was a regular in it.)')
('Van', "(I see that car out by Central Station a lot.<br/>Driver's probably out for lunch right now, though.)")
('Van', "(Let's check the food stalls first, see if we get lucky.)")
('Van', "(A taxi with a black and yellow checkered pattern...<br/>Pretty sure I've seen that once or twice.)")
('Van', "(Pretty sure it's usually out by Central Station...but I<br/>wanna say I've seen it out in other places, too.)")
('Van', '(Well, only one way to find out. Time to hit<br/>the pavement.)')
('Curtis', '*huff* *huff* Finally... I finally found you!')
('Curtis', "Hey, you're Maja, right? The herb seller? Tell me<br/>you've got the mints I'm looking for!")
('Maja', "Say, I don't think I recognize you. You look like you<br/>came from the surface, the way you're dressed.")
('Maja', "Hate to break it to you, but I don't stock that garbage.<br/>Honestly, you should really quit taking those things if<br/>you know what's good for you.")
('Curtis', "Liar! You have those mints! I know it! If I don't get<br/>more of those mints, I... I'm...!")
('Van', "Bingo. Knew this is where we'd find our poindexter.")
('Curtis', 'Huh? What do you want? I could swear I recognize<br/>you from somewhere...')
('Agnès', "You're Curtis, right?")
('Maja', "Clearly something's going on with this kid here.<br/>Mind filling me in?")
('Van', 'Sure. His mom sent out a request for us...')
('System', 'Van and company brought the two up to speed on the<br/>events that brought them there.')
('System', 'They clarified that the mints Curtis had been eating<br/>were reportedly laced with illicit substances.')
('Curtis', "Wh-What?! I didn't hear anything about that! All I<br/>knew was that they were hard to come by...")
('Curtis', 'I thought they were ordinary mints that just<br/>happened to taste like tobacco!')
('Maja', "Oh, there's more to them than that... Much more.")
('Maja', 'I heard they were manufactured by A—and that they<br/>leaked out onto the streets before the cops did their<br/>post-Tharbad roundup.')
('Maja', "The CID stamped out their pipelines, so they're not<br/>being made anymore—it's only a matter of time<br/>before they're off the streets completely.")
('Agnès', "Well, that's a relief.")
('Aaron', "I get you kids like to rebel against your parents, but<br/>hard drugs aren't exactly the got'cha you think<br/>they are.")
('Curtis', "It's not about that! I'm not trying to rebel—<br/>I NEED those mints! Why can't you<br/>simpletons understand?!")
('Feri', "It's not worth damaging your body! You really need<br/>to stop!")
('Van', "You're already showin' side effects, bud.<br/>That outburst there? Probably the mints makin' you<br/>irritable and prone to withdrawal.")
('Van', "Like it or not, those things are havin' an impact on<br/>you, and they're only gonna get worse the longer<br/>you're on 'em.")
('Curtis', "I KNOW that, for crying out loud! I KNOW<br/>they're dangerous! But I have to take them... If I don't<br/>have them, I can't study hard enough!")
('Curtis', "And if I can't study hard enough, I'll fail my entrance<br/>exam—and then I'll just be another stupid kid like all<br/>the rest...!")
('Curtis', "I don't even want to imagine how my parents would<br/>react if that happens...")
('Curtis', "They'll yell and scream and...maybe kick me out of<br/>the house... Haha. My life's over, isn't it?")
('Agnès', 'This poor kid... I feel awful for him.')
('Quatre', "That's...uncomfortably close to home. I can<br/>understand where he's coming from...")
('Risette', "This mint addiction seems to be a symptom of the<br/>real problem, then. We'll need to address the root<br/>cause to solve this case.")
('Judith', "This poor kid's been driven into a corner... We have<br/>to hold his parents accountable! No middle-schooler<br/>should be stressing like this!")
('Bergard', 'Fear not, young man.')
('Bergard', "So long as we're on this case, we won't let your<br/>parents unjustly punish you. That I promise.")
('Van', "*sigh* Okay, I didn't sign up to be this<br/>family's counselor...")
('Van', "...but it's pretty clear to me that the parents share<br/>some of the blame here. We're gonna need to give<br/>'em a talkin' to.")
('Van', "I know you're not gonna like this, but I need you to<br/>be part of that discussion with us. Okay?")
('Curtis', '...')
('Maja', "If you don't mind me asking, do you know who sold<br/>those mints to him in the first place?")
('Van', "We do, actually: blonde guy with a goatee.<br/>Seemed like he had a habit of slingin' his stuff<br/>around town.")
('Maja', "Oh, HIM. Should've figured... Don't you guys worry.<br/>He hasn't been on the streets for long—I'll be sure to<br/>remind him of the rules we have here.")
('Maja', "Though frankly, if he's going around selling drugs to<br/>children, he won't be on the streets for long.")
('Van', "Thanks. We'd really appreciate it—saves us the<br/>ballache of havin' to go find him again.")
('Van', "(I probably oughta report back to René before doin'<br/>anything else, though.)")
('Van', "Now that we're done here, let's swing back around to<br/>Bermotti's place and fill him in on the details.")
('Agnès', 'Good idea. Maybe he can take a look at Curtis and<br/>diagnose his condition, too.')
('System', 'Van and company quickly got to work, paying<br/>Bermotti a visit and filling him in on their<br/>minty mystery.')
('System', 'Having previously analyzed the ingredients found in<br/>the orbal hookahs, Bermotti was able to prescribe<br/>sorely-needed medicine for the boy.')
('System', "And once Curtis' symptoms subsided, Van contacted<br/>his parents.")
('System', "They agreed to reconvene at the family's home so that<br/>the group could report their findings.")
('Van', '(Oh, right. Those street racers asked me to scout<br/>some people.)')
('Van', "(If there's anybody I oughta talk to, she's at the top of<br/>the list.)")
('Van', "Hey, Hermès. Got a sec? I'm doin' a job for some<br/>street racers right now.")
('Van', "They're lookin' for some extra racers to fill out their<br/>lineup for today.")
('Hermès', 'Oh, are they now? Well, color me intrigued.<br/>Tell me more.')
('Hermès', '...Right. So they want to go all out for their big<br/>rematch, is the gist.')
('Hermès', 'Well, that seems fun! These guys sound like my kind<br/>of people.')
('Hermès', "Unfortunately, I've still got some work to take care<br/>of today. If the timing works out, though, I'd be<br/>happy to join in.")
('Van', "Nice. That'd be really great! Yeah, once you're free,<br/>just head right on over to the meet. Sound good?")
('Hermès', 'Better than good! Thanks for the invite.')
('Van', "Well, I've hit up everyone I can think of.")
('Van', "Guess all that's left is to loop back with the racers.")
('Van', "Well, I've hit up everyone I can think of.")
('Van', "Guess all that's left is to loop back with the racers.")
('Van', '(Oh, right. Those street racers asked me to scout<br/>some people.)')
('Van', "(I could hit up Walter, but...yeah, no. That's just<br/>askin' for trouble.)")
('Van', "(Maybe Master's willing to play ball.)")
('Van', "Hey, Master, you got a second? There's somethin' I<br/>wanted to ask you.")
('Bergard', 'No problem. What is it, Van?')
('Van', "...Anyway, they're looking for some racers to fill out<br/>their lineup for today.")
('Van', 'Sound like fun to you? I thought it might be up<br/>your alley.')
('Bergard', 'Hmm... That certainly is a tempting offer.')
('Bergard', "That said, I'm not sure they would appreciate some<br/>fogey my age crashing their party.")
('Bergard', "I think I'll pass, but I appreciate that you thought<br/>of me.")
('Van', "I don't think that'd be a deal breaker for them, but<br/>fair enough. I'll see if I can find someone else.")
('Bergard', 'Have you considered asking Aaron, perhaps?')
('Bergard', 'As it happens, I lent him my orbal bike for the<br/>duration of the festival.')
('Van', 'Oh, good thinking! I had no idea!')
('Van', '...You sure you want him racing on it, though?<br/>It could get scuffed up.')
('Bergard', 'A little dent or two is hardly a bother—I enjoy fixing<br/>those little gremlins.')
('Van', "All right. Thanks, Master. I'll hit him up and see<br/>what he has to say.")
('Van', "Well, I managed to get a hold of him. He's on board.")
('Bergard', "Good to hear! I'm glad it all worked out.")
('Bergard', "Of course, I can't say this too loudly, given the<br/>law-breaking involved, but I hope you all have a fun<br/>time at the race.")
('Van', "We will. I'll keep an eye on him so he doesn't fly off<br/>the handle...bars.")
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Yo. Mind if I join the party? Sounds like you guys are<br/>planning something big, and I want in.')
('Van', "Oh, great. My favorite... Weren't you supposed to be<br/>busy right now?")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Who cares if I was? I see you bunch shootin' the shit,<br/>I get curious. Nothing more to it.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "You said you're putting on a race or something?<br/>Bikes're allowed, I take it?")
('Van', "*sigh* Guess the cat's outta the bag. Yes. We've got<br/>motorcyclists racing, too.")
('Van', "Just don't go crazy here, all right? These guys are<br/>mostly amateurs.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Bull. The hell kinda race is it if you can't go balls out?")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Well, I'm racin', whether you like it or not. Tell 'em<br/>to get ready for an ass whoopin'.")
('Van', '...Damn it. This is exactly why I was tryna AVOID<br/>roping him in.')
('Bergard', 'It sounds like we have quite the climactic showdown<br/>at hand.')
('Van', "Well, I've hit up everyone I can think of.")
('Van', "Guess all that's left is to loop back with the racers.")
('Van', "*sigh* I can't believe I let you drag me here.")
('Aaron', "Oh, quit your bellyaching, grandpa. I know you didn't<br/>have anything better to do with your time. Why not<br/>have a go, just the two of us?")
('Van', "Look, I'm not in the mood for a fight, got it? If you<br/>wanna train together, I'm game, but it'll have to wait<br/>till another day.")
('Aaron', "You don't get it, man.")
('Aaron', "Now that the mafia's taken care of, I bet you feel like<br/>you're finally done with everything.")
('Van', '...I mean, sure.')
('Aaron', "Well, that's not how it feels for me.")
('Van', "'Cause of your 'unfinished business' and all?")
('Aaron', "Damn straight. And you know what that business is?<br/>I haven't beaten you one single time in a fight.")
('Van', 'And that matters WHY?')
('Van', 'You really care that much whether or not you can<br/>beat some random spriggan in a fight?')
('Aaron', 'Hell yeah, I still care.')
('Aaron', "Been two months and I still don't have a point on the<br/>damn board!")
('Aaron', "We've got a score to settle as men, you and me—and<br/>I'm not taking no for an answer.")
('Van', '...Damn brat. All right, fine.')
('Van', "You wanna fight? You got one. I know how it feels<br/>when you're left wantin' for closure.")
('Van', "Now, I'm only givin' you one chance. Put up or shut<br/>up, kid—gimme everything you got!")
('Aaron', "Damn straight, I will! Let's do this!")
('Aaron', '*huff* *huff* Shit...!')
('Aaron', "I was so close... A little more and I...I would've had it!")
('Van', "Technique always beats talent, kid. You can train as<br/>much as you want, but I'll still be top dog.")
('Aaron', 'You shut your hole. You barely won that and you<br/>know it.')
('Aaron', "Take it in while you can, you antique. Soon enough,<br/>it'll be YOU on the floor.")
('Van', "Bud, for the love of Aidios, four years really ain't<br/>that much. You just gonna harp on that forever?")
('Aaron', 'Of course I am. How many times have I gone on<br/>about that already...?')
('Van', "Couldn't tell you. Stopped countin' a long time ago.")
('Aaron', 'Heh heh...')
('Van', 'Hah... Hahaha!')
('Van', '                        Ahahahaha!')
('Aaron', 'Aaah! Nothing like a cold one after breaking a<br/>good sweat!')
('Van', "For someone who just became legal not that long ago,<br/>you sure don't drink like it.")
('Van', "But hey, if you're satisfied after that, I'm happy.")
('Aaron', "Oh, I never said I was satisfied—I've just made peace<br/>with it and moved on. For now.")
('Aaron', "One of these days, I'm gonna beat your ass REAL<br/>good, you hear?")
('Van', "You never make things easy for me, do you, punk?<br/>Am I just gonna be fendin' you off for the rest of<br/>my days?")
('Aaron', 'Nah, maybe a few months at most. All I gotta do is<br/>dethrone you—and it WILL happen, mark<br/>my words. Sooner than you think.')
('Van', "Heh, good luck with that. As if I'm just gonna sit<br/>here and take it.")
('Aaron', 'Like I said, all things in good time. You savor the<br/>view from the top while you still can.')
('Aaron', "End of the day, I don't even know if there's a way for<br/>us to settle the score for good. We've done too much<br/>for each other.")
('Aaron', "And you need to learn to slow down, too, chief.<br/>You're always living so hard and fast, right on<br/>the edge. Can't be good for your heart at your age.")
('Aaron', "Take it easy once in a while. Go out for drinks, take a<br/>day off. Shit can wait sometimes, you know what<br/>I'm saying?")
('Van', '...')
('Van', "Well, would you look at that? You're actually capable<br/>of saying something nice and helpful.<br/>Who'd've thought?")
('Van', "But enough about me. If anybody's in need of advice,<br/>it's you, punk. You should learn to ask others for help<br/>more often.")
('Van', "You might be a real pain in the neck, but you're MY<br/>pain in the neck—I'm always lookin' after you and<br/>makin' sure you don't fly off the rails.")
('Aaron', "Heh. I'll listen to you when Gehenna freezes and<br/>poms fly, got it?")
('System', "Van took Aaron's advice for once, and savored the<br/>moment with him over more than a couple cold ones.")
('System', 'Once Van returned to the surface, of course, he<br/>resumed his normal business.')
('Renne', "This must be what we're looking for.")
('Van', "That was some tricky shit to figure out.<br/>They definitely didn't cut us any slack.")
('Renne', "I'll say. We had to follow the thinnest threads we<br/>could find just to get here.")
('Renne', 'Had we not teamed up, this whole search would<br/>probably be dead in the water.')
('Van', "They must've trusted us to find it in the end, though,<br/>if it was here after all.")
('Van', "Well, let's crack it open and see what's inside.")
('System', 'Van unlocked the attaché case and threw it open<br/>to reveal...')
('Van', '...What?')
('Van', "Writing utensils and...painting supplies? The hell's<br/>this stuff for?")
('Van', "There's nothin' weird about any of 'em, just<br/>normal-ass pencils. I don't get it.")
('Van', "Oh, it looks like we've also got these, uh...these<br/>letters here.")
('Van', "They're addressed to the both of us.")
('Van', 'No sender listed, but I can only think of one.')
('Renne', 'Right. Grandpa Joerg, beyond a doubt.')
('System', 'Dear Renne,')
('System', "I realize I'm more than six months late. Before I say<br/>anything else, I want to congratulate you on your<br/>acceptance into Aramis.")
('System', "Time really does fly fast, doesn't it? It feels like it was<br/>only yesterday that you enrolled at Jenis.")
('System', "You've always had that impeccable talent and appetite<br/>for learning—from your studies to your papers and<br/>everywhere between.")
('System', 'You may have felt at first that there was no point<br/>returning to ordinary schooling—that it was a waste<br/>of time for a mind of your caliber.')
('System', "But there are some things you can only learn and<br/>experience in those common places. I suspect you've<br/>come to realize that yourself.")
('System', "Now that you have a place in this world to call your<br/>own, it's good to spread your wings and spend time<br/>away from your friends and family.")
('System', 'Although I only looked after you for a short period, I pray<br/>that you find happiness wherever your travels take you.<br/><br/>Sincerely, Grandpa Joerg')
('System', "PS: Thank you for taking care of those kids and<br/>'tidying up' the workshop during your visit a year<br/>and a half ago. I greatly appreciate it.")
('System', "I didn't know what to get you to celebrate your<br/>admission, so I simply picked up some safe bets for a<br/>student your age.")
('System', "If you have no use for them, feel free to throw<br/>them out. I'll hardly be hurt.")
('Renne', "Oh, don't be like that, Grandpa... I could never throw<br/>these things away.")
('Renne', "Heehee... He's still as he ever was. Awkward and<br/>clumsy outside of his dollmaking...and I wouldn't<br/>have it any other way.")
('Van', "All right. Let's see what he's got to say to me next.")
('System', 'To Mr. Van Arkride,')
('System', "It goes without saying that you and I have done much<br/>for each other over the years. I won't dwell on that<br/>ancient history.")
('System', 'But if I can offer one piece of advice to you, do not<br/>avert your eyes from the spirit you have within.')
('System', 'Beyond that, please continue to guide and protect<br/>my granddaughter.')
('System', "I trust that you're looking out for her while she's in<br/>your periphery.")
('Renne', "Did he really have to write that last part? I'm not used<br/>to seeing him be so protective.")
('Van', "Hard to blame the guy, he ain't seen you in years.<br/>Cut him a little slack, heh.")
('Van', "Least it's not just you he's bein' nosey with, anyway.")
('Renne', "What did he mean by your 'spirit within', though?<br/>That's an intriguing line...")
('Van', "...Beats me. No idea what he was talkin' about, but<br/>that's par for the course with him.")
('Van', 'I mean, you know how he is—guy just sees<br/>everything differently.')
('Van', "One hell of a grandpa you've got there, you<br/>know that?")
('Renne', 'People say his dolls are beyond lifelike—they even<br/>have their own hearts and souls.')
('Renne', "Maybe that power lets him take a look inside other<br/>people's hearts all the same.")
('Renne', "He could be on to something. It wouldn't hurt to<br/>keep what he wrote to you in mind, whatever it turns<br/>out to mean.")
('Van', '...Maybe, yeah.')
('Van', "So where is that old fart, anyway? Any idea where he<br/>is or what he's up to these days?")
('Renne', 'I have no idea. Your guess is as good as mine.')
('Renne', 'He may very well have slipped back to his workshop<br/>in Crossbell by now.')
('Renne', "Or perhaps he's abandoned it and set up shop<br/>somewhere else entirely. It's so hard to tell with him.")
('Van', "My master was like that, too. Maybe bein' all cryptic<br/>and shit's just part of gettin' old.")
('Renne', "Heehee. Maybe so. I'm happy to have heard from<br/>him, at least.")
('Renne', "Thanks for bringing me along, Van. I'll have to return<br/>the favor one of these days.")
('Van', 'Hey, take it down a notch. You play with fire, you<br/>might get burned.')
('Renne', "Oh, you think I'm still just some little girl, do you?")
('Renne', "I'll be all grown up before you know it—in many<br/>ways, I already am.")
('Renne', 'At least, enough for me to reach out and lend you a<br/>hand when you need it most...')
('Renne', '...just like you did for me all those years ago.')
('Van', "(Sheesh, the old man's right. This girl is growing up<br/>fast—TOO fast, if you ask me.)")
('Van', "Sure. I'll ring you up if I really need a hand.")
('System', 'Van saw Renne back to her dormitory and left the<br/>attaché case in her care. With that, the two went their<br/>separate ways.')
('System', 'And just like that, it was back to the usual business.')
('System', 'Van and Fie made haste to the Blacklight District.')
('System', "Upon arrival, they scoured the area in search of<br/>replacement parts for Aida's rifle.")
('Morgan', "You're looking to fix up a custom rifle, eh? Not to<br/>discourage you fine folks, but that sounds like quite<br/>the pain in the behind.")
('Fie', "We know—and we're prepared to deal with it. As you<br/>can probably guess, we need some specialized parts to<br/>get it back in working condition.")
('Fie', "Mind showing us the rifle suppressors and foregrips<br/>you've got in stock at the moment?")
('Morgan', "Not at all! Right this way, young lady—hopefully I've<br/>got what you're looking for.")
('Fie', "He's definitely got a wide selection, but...hrm.<br/>None of it looks quite right.")
('Van', 'What about this part over here?')
('Van', "Looks pretty unwieldy, but nothin' any decent jaeger<br/>couldn't handle.")
('Fie', 'Hmm... Yeah, maybe. That might actually be the<br/>same model Aida used—or the same make, at least.')
('Fie', 'This might work in a pinch. Might as well give it<br/>a shot.')
('Gabriella', "Working on Flameeater's rifle, huh? I've heard stories<br/>about that bad boy.")
('Gabriella', "You're in luck. I know for a fact that the rifle I used<br/>back when I was on active duty is the same generation<br/>as her gun.")
('Gabriella', 'You can go ahead and take it, if you want. It should<br/>have a part or two you can use.')
('Van', "Damn, that's real generous of you.")
('Fie', 'For real. Are you sure? I mean, that has to mean a lot<br/>to you.')
('Gabriella', "I'm no jaeger anymore, so I don't mind parting<br/>with it. Helping the colonel's daughter sounds better<br/>to me, anyway.")
('Gabriella', "In return, just promise you'll come back and tell me<br/>how the Purple Lightning's doing.")
('Gabriella', "I've been rooting for her ever since she hung it up to<br/>walk her own path. Lemme know how she's holding<br/>up, yeah?")
('Fie', "Deal. Can't say I know everything, but I'll be happy<br/>to share what I can.")
('System', 'Eventually, Fie and Van managed to scrape together<br/>the needed parts to repair the gun—albeit from a<br/>less-than-desirable mix of sources.')
('System', 'With Feri having acquired her allotted parts, the<br/>group reconvened at the arms dealer inside the<br/>department store.')
('Inspector Daswani', '...I was starting to wonder on the way here if this was<br/>where you were taking me.')
('Van', "Aww, don't be like that. I'm just takin' you<br/>through a nice, dingy underground shopping center,<br/>Inspector, just like any other in Edith!")
('Inspector Daswani', '...')
('Van', "...Look, you're not makin' this any better for either<br/>of us. Wipe that frown off your face already.")
('Van', "All right, I'll stop yuckin' around. This your first<br/>rodeo, or you been down here before?")
('Inspector Daswani', "It's been over a decade. This isn't exactly my kind of<br/>place, either professionally or personally.")
('Inspector Daswani', "I swear. I just can't wrap my head around it...")
('Inspector Daswani', 'How anyone could just choose to live down here, and<br/>how the authorities could turn a blind eye to how<br/>obviously foul it is, is just beyond me.')
('Van', "That's what I'm here for, pal. You wouldn't last a<br/>minute down here by yourself.")
('Van', "Anyway, time's a wastin'. Let's talk to the locals first<br/>and see what we can figure out.")
('System', 'Van and Inspector Daswani first inquired with<br/>Gabriella, the proprietress of a local drinking hole.')
('System', 'She informed them about a new scalper who had<br/>recently arrived. The two decided to try their luck by<br/>visiting him.')
(40301, "Heh heh heh, you're in luck, my good man!")
(40301, "I've got exactly what you're looking for! I just put<br/>those dolls up on display!")
(40301, "You don't know how hard I had to work to<br/>obtain them. Those things aren't easy to come by!")
('Inspector Daswani', '...')
('Van', "Probably goes without saying: if you move forward<br/>with it, this ain't gonna be the most legit sale you've<br/>ever done.")
('Van', "Just puttin' that out there. What you decide to do<br/>with that information's up to you.")
('Inspector Daswani', "...I don't need some street rat like you lecturing me<br/>about morals.")
('Inspector Daswani', "*sigh* Hell, sure, I'll take one. How much do<br/>you want?")
(40301, 'Heh heh. Pleasure doing business with you, sir.')
(40301, "That'll be 10,000 mira, thank you very much.")
('Inspector Daswani', "You serious?! That's ten times the MSRP!<br/>You'd better give me a damn good reason why!")
(40301, "As I just explained to you, sir, these dolls are quite the<br/>hot commodity right now. I'm simply charging what<br/>the market is willing to pay.")
('Inspector Daswani', 'Like hell! You think you can get away with<br/>fleecing me? Huh?!')
(40301, "Aaah! D-Don't hurt me!")
('Van', "Sorry, pal. Doesn't look like you know who this guy<br/>is, so lemme fill you in.")
('Van', "You're lookin' at the personal bodyguard for this<br/>district's head honcho.")
('Van', "Wanna guess how he got so strong? By settin' crooks<br/>straight by force when they step outta line.")
('Van', "I hear you're new here, so I guess nobody took the<br/>time to fill you in yet. Can't fault you for that.")
('Inspector Daswani', '...')
('Van', "But now that you know who you're dealin' with, you<br/>MIGHT wanna consider cuttin' the man a discount.")
('Van', "Otherwise, life's gonna come at'cha real fast in just a<br/>couple of seconds.")
(40301, 'Okay, okay, I give! You win!')
(40301, "So, normal retail price plus a finder's fee to<br/>compensate me for my labor. Does that sound fair?")
('Van', "(Heh, still a snake to the bitter end—but he knows<br/>what's up now, at least.)")
('Van', "What's your call, boss? Deal?")
('Inspector Daswani', "Hmph. Yeah, I'll take it.")
('Van', "Fantastic. Another satisfied customer you've made.")
('Van', 'So I hope this taught you a valuable lesson: be careful<br/>how you do business down here, got it?')
('Inspector Daswani', 'Let me ask you one more question before I leave.')
('Inspector Daswani', 'What on Zemuria made you decide to come live in a<br/>place like this?')
(40301, "Wh-Wha...? That's a weird question to ask. But if I<br/>had to say...")
('System', "Van's group decided to take a short break.")
('System', 'Everyone split up so they could spend their free time<br/>as they pleased.')
('Van', 'There he is.')
('Van', "Looks like Jack's got business with Yimai.")
('Jack', "Hey! This isn't what you promised, old man!")
('Yimai', "Promised? Now, I'm sorry, but I haven't the foggiest<br/>idea what you're talking about. I never promised you<br/>anything, you see.")
('Van', "'Sup? Got a problem?")
('Jack', 'Oh, hey, Van. You actually came, huh?')
('Van', 'Yeah. Was just a little concerned about you, is all.')
('Van', 'So what happened?')
('Jack', 'I asked this guy to reserve a certain ten<br/>mira coin for me on the off chance he came across<br/>it so I could buy it off him.')
('Jack', 'But instead, he went behind my back and pawned it<br/>off to somebody else.')
('Van', "A...ten mira coin? What's got you worked up over it?")
('Yimai', "It's what we in the business call an 'error coin'.<br/>A misprint, if you will.")
('Yimai', 'Not only are the portrait and text flipped, but the<br/>copper is the wrong color, too. It has this slight silver<br/>hue to it.')
('Yimai', 'These little mistakes are one in ten thousand, if not<br/>rarer—30,000 mira per coin is quite common.')
('Yimai', "But that's not all that can inflate the value of these,<br/>no, sir.")
('Yimai', "Owner history plays a part, too—and a previous<br/>owner as infamous as this coin's can bump the value<br/>up even higher. 50,000, by my estimate.")
('Van', "Damn, 50,000 mira for a little coin? Must've had one<br/>hell of a past life to command that kinda money.")
('Jack', "You're damn right it did. I take it you know about my<br/>mentor—and my greatest rival?")
('Van', 'Course I do.')
('Van', "The King himself, ain't it? Halle's own old man.")
('Jack', "Right... Then you probably know that he's not<br/>around anymore. There's a reason for that...")
('Jack', 'I was a dumb little shit when I was younger. My cocky<br/>ass got him killed.')
('Van', "Damn, dude. I'm sorry. Didn't mean to dig up all<br/>that baggage.")
('Jack', "Well, now you know. Anyway, I'm sure you've put<br/>two and two together. That coin we're arguing over<br/>used to belong to him.")
('Jack', 'After he died, that coin disappeared. I had no idea<br/>where it went—at least, until...')
('Yimai', '...until yours truly happened upon it.')
('Yimai', 'Jack offered 100,000 mira for that little coin—and at<br/>the time, I was more than happy to give it to him.')
('Yimai', 'Unfortunately, another customer beat him to the<br/>punch with a 105,000 mira offer. Poor Jack was just<br/>minutes too late.')
('Yimai', 'It really was nothing personal—I was just doing as a<br/>businessman does and taking the better offer.')
('Jack', "Oh, give me a break. If you'd just TOLD me<br/>somebody had put in a counteroffer, I would've put<br/>up more money, too!")
('Van', "That IS a little odd that you didn't do that this time.<br/>I know just how much you like to wring people for<br/>every mira they're worth.")
('Van', "So who's the moneybags who ran off with the coin?")
('Yimai', "Haha. Well, if you want to know, you'll have to go<br/>straight to the source.")
('Yimai', 'As it so happens, the buyer left a note to pass on<br/>to Jack.')
('Yimai', "It says quite plainly, 'If you'd like the coin back, come<br/>to Caiyunge.'")
('Jack', "Great. You couldn't just sell the damn coin to them—<br/>you had to help them antagonize me, too.<br/>Thanks, Yimai.")
('Jack', 'Every now and again, someone comes out of the<br/>woodwork, trying to pick a fight with me.')
('Jack', "Who's got it out for me this time, though, I haven't<br/>a clue.")
('Van', "Yeah, I remember that pair of cheaters you had to<br/>deal with in Langport when we were in town.<br/>Sure ain't easy bein' famous, huh?")
('Van', "You headin' over right now, then? I think I'll tag<br/>along to see how it goes down.")
('Jack', "Sure, go ahead. I don't mind the company.")
('System', 'Van led Shizuna to a merchant he felt might be able<br/>to assist her.')
('Van', 'Hey, buddy. Got a minute to talk?')
('Morgan', "Well, hello there, Van! It's so wonderful to see you!<br/>And who else do you have with you today...?")
('Morgan', "Oh, my gracious! Am I seeing things? Or is that the<br/>Ikaruga's right hand woman herself?!")
('Shizuna', "Oh, you know who I am? I'm flattered! Nice to<br/>meet you.")
('Morgan', 'Oh, no, the pleasure is all mine, truly!')
('Morgan', 'What brings you, of all people, to my humble<br/>little armory?')
('Shizuna', "It looks like you mostly sell weapons here, but you<br/>wouldn't happen to offer repair services, too,<br/>would you?")
('Morgan', 'Why, yes, I do!')
('Shizuna', "Perfect. Then I've got a little favor to ask you...")
('Shizuna', "...but only if you keep my visit here a secret. I trust<br/>that won't be a problem?")
('Morgan', "Your secret's safe with me, ma'am! Confidentiality is<br/>my prime directive here at the shop.")
('Morgan', "Oh, I'm just shaking! A real Divine Blade right here<br/>in my store! It's like Aidios herself descended right<br/>before my eyes!")
('Morgan', 'My word...')
('Morgan', "Such splendid craftsmanship! It's so...so beautiful!<br/>Too beautiful for this world!")
('Morgan', "I'm really sorry, ma'am, but I don't think I have what<br/>it takes to handle a blade of such splendor!")
('Shizuna', "Oh, it's not the blade I need help with. It's the<br/>scabbard that needs attention.")
('Morgan', 'A-Ah, so it is! Forgive my presumption!')
('Morgan', 'Yes, it does seem to have developed a minor crack.')
('Morgan', 'This seems to be made differently from your typical<br/>scabbard, but I should be able to restore it all<br/>the same.')
('Morgan', "In fact, it shouldn't take me all that long. Just give me<br/>a little time and I'll have it as good as new!")
('Shizuna', 'Great! Glad to hear it!')
('Shizuna', 'If you could just fill in the missing portion with this,<br/>that would be perfect.')
('Van', "A blade tip? Where'd that come from?")
('Shizuna', 'From a younger disciple in my school. I like to think<br/>of it as a memento of the short time I shared<br/>with him.')
('Morgan', "Are you sure you want to do that? If I'm being<br/>honest, I have materials on hand that would be better<br/>suited for this sort of restoration.")
('Shizuna', "That's okay. I know what I'm asking for. I think this<br/>fits it better, personally.")
('Morgan', "As you wish! I'll have it patched up in just a<br/>few moments.")
('Van', "(Hmm... Can't say I really know what kind of style<br/>that Black God One Blade of hers is like.)")
('Van', "(Got me curious about this 'younger disciple' of<br/>hers, though.)")
('Van', '(I remember her using a fancy technique in Longlai<br/>that came from a new Divine Blade... Maybe the two<br/>are related.)')
('Shizuna', "Curious to learn more, huh? I'd be happy to fill<br/>you in.")
('Van', "...I'll pass. Not really my business.")
('Shizuna', 'Uh-huh. If you say so.')
('Morgan', "All finished! Here you go, ma'am.")
('Shizuna', "Wonderful! I gotta say, I'm impressed—this looks<br/>pretty good. Thanks!")
('Morgan', "Oh, gee, you're just too kind, Silverblade! It was my<br/>honor to have your business.")
('Shizuna', "All righty. Now that's one less thing to worry about.")
('Van', 'I bet. Be a pain in the ass to lug that thing around if<br/>the scabbard went kaput.')
('Shizuna', "Oh, yeah. And the problems don't stop there with<br/>this sword.")
('Shizuna', "This isn't your average blade. It's always emanating a<br/>certain...energy. It's hard to describe.")
('Shizuna', "Not exactly 'cursed', but more like 'imbued'.<br/>'Bewitched', even, some trained eyes have called it.")
('Shizuna', "I have to keep that energy in check with the scabbard<br/>or it might...spill out. And that'd get real ugly,<br/>real fast.")
('Van', "...Well, that ain't ominous at all.")
('Shizuna', "Anyway, that's why the scabbard's made<br/>so differently.")
('Shizuna', "The entire thing's built from weapons and armor that<br/>I took from formidable fighters I've encountered on<br/>my travels.")
('Shizuna', "Those weapons—and their wielders' fighting spirits—<br/>are the only materials capable of holding back the<br/>blade's power.")
('Van', '...Huh.')
('Morgan', 'I...see.')
('Shizuna', "If you could keep all that to yourself, too, shopkeep,<br/>I'd really appreciate it.")
('Morgan', 'Y-Yes, of course! My lips are sealed so tight, not even<br/>Aidios herself could pry them open!')
('Van', "(Just who the hell is this chick, carryin' that dicey-ass<br/>blade on her like it's a walk in the park?)")
('Van', "(...Meh, probably shouldn't think on it too hard. It all<br/>sounded kinda bullshit, so maybe it WAS bullshit.)")
('Shizuna', "Fair point—who's to say I DIDN'T just make it<br/>all up? It still got the point across, though, didn't it?<br/>Every sword needs a story.")
('Van', 'You really wanna cast that kinda doubt on your public<br/>image, though? Might not be a good look.')
('Van', '...Wait, what the— Did you just read my mind?!<br/>I— Cut that shit out!')
('Shizuna', "Well, now that we've got all that out of the way, I<br/>think I'll be heading back up.")
('Shizuna', "Thanks for showing me around, Van! Let's do this<br/>again some time soon, all right?")
('Van', "I'd, uh...really rather not make a habit of this if I can<br/>help it.")
('Shizuna', "Aww, don't be such a spoilsport.")
('Shizuna', 'Maybe you and I should square off after all like<br/>you suggested. Whatever it takes to build a better<br/>relationship with you! ㈱')
('Van', 'To hell with that! How many times do I have to<br/>tell you?!')
('System', 'After bidding Shizuna an exhausted farewell, Van<br/>reunited with the rest of the gang and got back<br/>to work.')
('Zin the Immovable', "Hold it, Arkride. We've still got business in this part<br/>of town.")
('Van', 'Gah! All right, all right.')
('Aaron', "Hey, chief. You don't think you're done already,<br/>do you?")
('Risette', 'Indeed. I believe you still have some things left to<br/>teach about navigating this district.')
('Van', "Yeah, I guess you're right. Follow me. We'll<br/>keep going.")
('Agnès', "Don't you think we should look around for Marielle a<br/>little more?")
('Aaron', "Ugh, just what we needed. That chick's always<br/>causing trouble for us.")
('System', 'The area is sealed off by an enormous barrier.')
('System', 'This road seems to lead to the outside, but the door<br/>before it is locked tight.')
