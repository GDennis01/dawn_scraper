('Kilika', 'I read the report on Langport.')
(500, 'Central Intelligence Department<br/>- Integrated Analysis Division')
('Kilika', 'For such a complicated series of events, it was<br/>impressively digestible.')
('Kilika', 'Your remote management of the situation was superb<br/>as always, Kincaid.')
('Kincaid', "You flatter me. Originally, I'd intended to travel<br/>there myself.")
('Kincaid', 'Unfortunately, with a certain A-rank bracer operating<br/>within Heiyue territory, such a trip became infeasible.')
('Kilika', 'Which led you to play your wild card in order to<br/>gain control.')
('Kilika', 'A wise decision. Doing so kept our sleeper agents<br/>stationed there out of trouble.')
('Kilika', "I'm curious. Is he another longtime friend of yours,<br/>like that bracer?")
('Kincaid', "I'd describe him more as a curse I can't be rid of.")
('Kilika', 'Interesting. I heard he worked behind the scenes of<br/>Operation Mille Mirage as well.')
('Kilika', 'Speaking of Arkride Solutions, can I get another<br/>update on their status?')
('Kilika', "I'm curious to learn about their latest addition.")
('Kincaid', "As you wish. I'll have one of my subordinates deliver<br/>it to you later.")
('Kincaid', "On that note, I'll be taking my leave. If you'll excuse<br/>me, Chief Rouran.")
('Kilika', 'Of course. Keep up the good work.')
('Kilika', 'Quite a talented and driven man, that one.')
('Kilika', "He may be a little too eager to take matters into his<br/>own hands at times, but I can't fault a young upstart<br/>for being ambitious.")
('Kilika', 'Still, the question remains as to how the society is<br/>linked to both the Republic and Almata.')
('Kilika', "Seeing as help will be arriving, perhaps it's time I<br/>reach out for a little...catching up.")
('System', 'A number of VIPs would soon descend upon the<br/>capital, ready to take part in moments both solemn<br/>and merry.')
