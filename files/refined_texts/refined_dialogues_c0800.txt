('Oslo', "I heard from the police and the folks at Marduk<br/>about what's going on out there...")
('Oslo', "We're having a real drought of clients, just like<br/>everyone else. Our whole organization is having<br/>trouble handling it.")
('Oslo', 'But if I try and address it myself, suddenly it becomes<br/>my responsibility.')
('Oslo', 'We at least should start budgeting for damages, so<br/>that we can weather the storm and pick up the<br/>pieces afterward.')
('Oslo', "It's good to see things have cleared up a bit outside.")
('Oslo', "I wonder how everybody at the company's doing...<br/>Our clients, too.")
('Oslo', "I should at least get in contact with them, try and<br/>make sure they're okay. Once this is over, we need to<br/>start picking up the pieces.")
('Oslo', "This festival will be a big boon for the economy<br/>going forward... Maybe it's time we<br/>considered expanding.")
('Oslo', 'But, well, perhaps I should just take my mind off<br/>work for today. Looking at the festival from a<br/>customer perspective is plenty valuable, too.')
('Oslo', "I just have to, erm...not do what I usually do to relax.<br/>I've learned my lesson...")
('Oslo', "I can't let my guard down, or karma will pay me<br/>back tenfold.")
('Oslo', "Oh, it's you! Thank you for earlier.")
('Oslo', 'Give my regards to that young man who helped out<br/>with the orbal network stuff, next time you see him.')
('Oslo', "You know, I've just realized: the musical landscape<br/>here has really changed since I graduated.")
('Oslo', "Idols, rock bands, singer-songwriters... We didn't<br/>have any of that when I was younger.")
('Oslo', "Then again, I wasn't much for partying in my<br/>youth anyway. I was nose-deep in the books, trying to<br/>guarantee I'd land a good job.")
('Oslo', "Perhaps I should give this new generation of music a<br/>listen—you're never too old to be hip and happening!")
('Oslo', "Gotti's latest movie was...well, raunchy, as his usually<br/>are—but it brought back some ugly memories<br/>for me...")
('Oslo', 'Once the state of emergency lifts and the festival<br/>begins, the marketplace should get a nice shot in<br/>the arm.')
('Oslo', 'I imagine plenty of industries will try to time their<br/>expansion with it—and that brings a need for<br/>eagle-eyed consultants like us.')
('Oslo', 'And speaking of, the festival is an excellent<br/>opportunity to conduct some market research.')
('Oslo', "It's nice that this uptick in my work will keep<br/>me busy...")
('Oslo', '...but man, I really need to find a better way of letting<br/>off steam. No more adult websites for me—I need to<br/>go cold turkey.')
('Oslo', 'There must be something else that might help<br/>me unwind.')
('Oslo', "It doesn't surprise me that they froze that<br/>project's funding.")
('Oslo', "I'm still reeling from all this...but I still have a job<br/>to do. I have to help the company however I can.")
('Oslo', "I can't sit idly by—someone needs to negotiate these<br/>bearish forecasts and spooked investors.")
('Oslo', 'If the word had got out that we got phished on some<br/>explicit website...heavens, our reputation would have<br/>been sunk.')
('Oslo', "I can't thank you enough. Trust is paramount for our<br/>firm—it's not something you can simply buy.")
('Oslo', "So I'm swearing off those spaces. Now I just need to<br/>find some other way to unwind after a long<br/>day's work...")
('Oslo', "But, really now, I can't believe there are scams like<br/>that on the orbal network. I tried bringing it to the<br/>police, but they weren't much help.")
('Oslo', "And since I used a work computer, I've effectively<br/>incriminated myself. Is there some way to erase my<br/>search history, by chance...?")
('Oslo', 'With technology comes trickery, I suppose.<br/>Those who lack the savvy can find<br/>themselves trapped.')
('Oslo', "I'll need to be much more cautious on the orbal net<br/>going forward.")
('Oslo', "*sigh* This old fogey just isn't with the times,<br/>I'm afraid.")
('Oslo', 'I should read up on the orbal network to avoid<br/>making that mistake again.')
('Oslo', 'At any rate, fingers crossed for good news!')
('Oslo', 'A scam website... The mere thought just<br/>unnerves me.')
('Oslo', "I've already had to swallow my pride and put in<br/>a request... Do I just have to hope someone takes it?")
('Quatre', '(Hmm? I think that man may have put in a request.)')
('Oslo', "Phew. That request from the Verne Company is<br/>really taking the lion's share of my attention.")
('Oslo', "And upper management is already at their wits' end<br/>with that litigation debacle.")
('Oslo', "Red Star and ETWS are poised to cause even more<br/>problems if we don't keep their power and foreign ties<br/>in check.")
('Oslo', "But then, there's the rub: we find that perfect balance<br/>and we put a king's ransom in our pockets.")
('Oslo', "This case is proving to be a cut above what we<br/>usually handle. I'd like to be there in the thick of it to<br/>make sure it all goes smoothly.")
('Oslo', "But perhaps a little pick-me-up first wouldn't hurt.")
('Oslo', "Word through the grapevine is, several BOE<br/>companies are looking to overhaul their investment<br/>portfolio once Erebonia's reparations dry up.")
('Oslo', 'The smaller fish in the pond will need to rethink their<br/>own strategies as well.')
('Oslo', "I suspect that'll be good for us—we'll have plenty of<br/>companies in need of financial advice.")
('Oslo', 'These days, clients appreciate the outsider<br/>perspectives we offer, free from the old norms of<br/>the industry.')
('Oslo', 'Hmm... So M&A needs a new hiring policy, do<br/>they...?')
('Oslo', 'Our specialists all have their plates full, so I believe<br/>this falls to me. I should do some research on the<br/>topic first.')
('Oslo', 'With the economy booming over these last two years,<br/>M&A has revamped their management strategy.')
('Oslo', 'Consultants react to changes in the market...and in<br/>turn, they influence the market themselves. They play<br/>off each other like that.')
('Simon', "Heh. Kirk's runnin' his mouth like he always is.<br/>Guess if he's still business as usual, I can be, too.")
('Simon', 'But man, things have really gotten out of hand.')
('Simon', "I figure I can at least help out at a shelter<br/>or something. I'm used to corralling misfits, heh.")
('Simon', "Well, looks like the team's having fun. Guess I should<br/>check in on downtown, see how things're going there.")
('Simon', "Place's seen better days, for sure, but they deserve<br/>their time in the sun just like everybody else.")
('Simon', "I'm gonna go downtown and play a game or two with<br/>the boys. I'll probably swing back here once it's dark.")
('Simon', 'Sure, our team has some oddballs and some<br/>straight laces...')
('Simon', "...but we mesh together pretty well regardless. End of<br/>the day, we're all neighbors, and a good neighbor has<br/>your back.")
('Simon', 'When that emergency declaration went down,<br/>everybody kept in touch and worked to keep their<br/>streets clear.')
('Simon', "Heh. I guess that's a benefit of throwin' together a<br/>buncha misfits like us.")
('Simon', "The boys were all lookin' forward to the festival.<br/>Glad they were able to pull it off without a hitch.")
('Simon', 'Really, the only thing we got in common is that we all<br/>have too much energy.')
('Simon', "So it's nice to cut loose and let it all out like this.")
('Simon', "Man... Things've really gone to Gehenna here.")
('Simon', "Once I make sure the team's all good, I'm gettin' my<br/>ass downtown to try and help.")
('Simon', "I'm not crazy about this whole lockdown thing...but,<br/>well, doesn't affect me much. I keep all my crazies<br/>in line.")
('Simon', 'Best I can do now is keep an eye out for shady types,<br/>keep our area safe.')
('Simon', 'Man, James got straight embarrassed there. I could<br/>hardly believe my eyes.')
('Simon', "But he wasn't pissed about it—he looked<br/>relieved, actually. Like a weight came off<br/>his shoulders... Guess he needed that.")
('Simon', 'Actually, Sasha was looking like she still had an itch<br/>afterward, so maybe float her a challenge?')
('Simon', 'I was able to squeeze out a win, but man, she was<br/>tough as ever.')
('Simon', "Heard Kirk tried to take her on, too—he held his own,<br/>but he couldn't beat her either.")
('Simon', "Probably looked past her 'cause she's a girl,<br/>the dumbshit. He's been real full of himself lately.")
('Simon', "So y'know, it's good that he got knocked off his high<br/>horse like that. Better now than later.")
('Simon', "Now he's pullin' all-nighters practicing, heh.<br/>He's really taken that beating to heart. I'll keep an eye<br/>on him, see how that goes.")
('Simon', "Sasha got a ride to Aramis, she's playin' ball up<br/>there now. But a few years back, she was here<br/>dominating these streets!")
('Simon', "Heh. I dunno who's all with you, but this'll be<br/>fun regardless. Been a while, hasn't it?")
('Simon', "I've been needing a little challenge in my life, too.<br/>Once this is over, let's scrap a bit for old times' sake!")
('Simon', "Damn, Sasha. You really grew up, didn't ya? You rock<br/>that uniform.")
('Simon', "Dumbass didn't know what hit him, pickin' a fight<br/>with a firecracker like you.")
('Simon', "I think I'll watch this one and see if he learns a thing<br/>or two.")
('Simon', "Oh, it's you. Hey, thanks for helpin' out with that<br/>whole thing with Mark.")
('Simon', "Those boys he got wrapped up with are still goin' and<br/>causin' trouble, if ya could believe it.")
('Simon', "They're just actin' like nothin' happened after they<br/>sent one of their own guys to die. Makes me<br/>wanna puke.")
('Simon', "And they're still gettin' new members—guess some<br/>numbnuts out there think they're cool.")
('Simon', "Damn shame, really. Gullible kids think they're<br/>tough, so they fall in with the gangs and ride 'em all<br/>the way down into the gutter.")
('Simon', "I get it, I do. Everyone's got their own stuff going on.<br/>But gangs are the last thing a kid needs.")
('Simon', "Even punks can find the right place to be—they just<br/>gotta look. That's what ball is to us.")
('Simon', "We ain't all got clean rap sheets, but that doesn't<br/>matter here. We leave it all on the court.")
('Simon', 'Everybody has stuff on their plate, but you can find<br/>common ground—find a place where you belong—if<br/>you just get help and talk to people.')
('Simon', "But the gangs don't give a shit about that. They just<br/>drag people down and don't let go, bein' miserable for<br/>the sake of it.")
('Simon', "Makes me sick. That ain't no road to recovery, it's<br/>just a downward spiral.")
('Van', '(Sounds like he knows the full story behind<br/>that request... We should ask him about it.)')
('Van', 'Hey, so we had a quick chat with Amy.')
('Simon', 'You did?! What did you tell her?')
('Van', 'The truth.')
('Van', "She took the news a bit rough, but I think she's<br/>accepted it.")
('Simon', "Got'cha. I think that'll make Mark happy...wherever<br/>he is.")
('Simon', 'Thanks, guys... She deserved that closure.')
('Van', 'I told her what Mark wanted her to hear.')
('Van', 'That whole bit about him falling for some foreign girl<br/>and never coming back to Calvard.')
('Simon', "Got'cha. I think that's what Mark woulda wanted.")
('Simon', 'Thanks, guys... She deserved that closure.')
('Simon', "I'll leave it up to you, what you say to Amy.")
('Simon', "'Sup? Haven't seen you guys around here. You don't<br/>look like tryouts...")
('Simon', "I'm running this street basketball team, see?<br/>Got some of the downtown guys here.")
('Simon', "We kinda sold out lately, so there haven't been as<br/>many guys comin' to try out.")
('Van', "Oh, yeah. I heard a thing or two about that—some<br/>team from the streets makin' noise around town.")
('Van', "Really blew up, didn't it? This street ball thing<br/>you started.")
('Simon', "Oh, yeah, it's real big business now. It's better as an<br/>outlet than what we used to do—now we can leave it<br/>all out on the court.")
('Simon', "You got some rough dudes, yeah, but they're pretty<br/>chill here.")
('Simon', "...Okay, maybe rough's undersellin' it a bit. But why<br/>don'tcha take a look and see for yourself?")
('Simon', "We've been getting some new guys around<br/>here lately. Real silver spoon types.")
('Simon', "Some of our other guys can't stand 'em—downtown<br/>might as well be a whole 'nother world.")
('Simon', "Anyway, our guys are usually pretty chill, even if they<br/>get a bit full of themselves. Feel free to chat 'em up.")
('Kirk', "Tch. Go figure Simon has to play the hero, helping<br/>other people out while we're all turning tail.")
('Kirk', "I'll have to step up my game, too.")
('Kirk', 'Damn it all... What do we even do here?')
('Kirk', "And what the hell is Simon doing? He's seriously<br/>running home NOW, of all times?")
('Kirk', "...N-No, I'm overthinking. He'll be fine, this is<br/>Simon we're talking about.")
('Kirk', 'So Simon and Frawla are going to check on their<br/>neighborhood, huh...?')
('Kirk', "Well, whatever. We have some time to kill, so I guess<br/>I'll practice a little. It's been a while.")
('Kirk', "Everyone's doing whatever, right? Might as well take<br/>a load off.")
('Kirk', '...Not like my folks care if I come home or<br/>not, anyway.')
('Kirk', "That really the best you got? Heh, barely broke<br/>a sweat. You'll have to train harder if you wanna<br/>beat me!")
(15037, 'Aaand there he goes back on his high horse. Prick.')
(15037, 'Whatever. He was probably just so freaked out last<br/>time, it threw off his game.')
('Kirk', 'For the last time, I was NOT freaked out and I was<br/>NOT off my game. Got it?!')
('Kirk', "Maybe instead of running your mouth, you can run<br/>it back! Or do you know you'll lose again?")
('Kirk', "I heard the festival's going forward as scheduled.")
('Kirk', "It's nice and all, but man, some of these guys just will<br/>not shut up about it. Do they really have to drag me<br/>to it with them?")
('Kirk', "But, well, I guess it's all in good fun. Least I can do is<br/>lend them an ear.")
('Kirk', 'They were just raised differently, I guess. The festival<br/>was never big in my household...not that I want to<br/>talk about my household.')
('Kirk', "...Meh. That's all in the past now. Long as I keep<br/>myself out of trouble, we're all good.")
('Kirk', 'No, I did NOT choke, I just let down my guard<br/>a little. Hmph.')
('Kirk', "This girl does have some hoops, I'll admit—she had<br/>to have been good for Simon to take notice.")
('Kirk', "Next time we face off, it won't go so smoothly<br/>for her. You'll see.")
('Kirk', "I guess I see what Simon's getting at—she DOES<br/>have potential.")
('Kirk', 'But is it really worth tying up the court just for a one<br/>on one with some preppy Aramis kid?')
('Kirk', "I mean, where's the fun in watching a schoolboy go<br/>up against our queen of the streets?")
('Kirk', "We're one of the strongest teams around.<br/>People don't wanna see us beating up small fry, they<br/>wanna see a challenge.")
('Kirk', "Pfft, that's all you've got? Don't you catch on after<br/>losing over and over again?")
(15037, "Goddess, I hate his arrogant ass...but I gotta admit<br/>he's good. That ain't just dumb luck.")
(15038, "Simon's probably the only one who can take him on<br/>at this point.")
(15038, "But, Kirk, a little advice from someone who's been<br/>around longer than you: pride comes before the fall.")
('Kirk', "Sounds like you're just mad because you're bad, but<br/>thanks for the advice.")
('Kirk', "Hate to say it, but I'm just built different from most<br/>of the players here.")
('Kirk', 'Anybody can practice here, of course, but man,<br/>sometimes it gets hard to practice with those<br/>guys around. I can feel their jealous eyes on me.')
('Kirk', "Is Simon really the only player good enough for me?<br/>I don't care if it's somebody talented or just a physical<br/>freak, just give me something!")
('Kirk', "Well, whatever. Two-on-one is fine by me—these<br/>guys can't beat me one-on-one.")
(15037, "Tch! This little prick's really pissing me off!<br/>You watch your mouth, punk!")
(15038, "Don't try him, he's not all talk. I heard they're gonna<br/>start giving him minutes on the team.")
(15037, 'What, with his height? Pssh.')
('Kirk', "...You wanna say that again? I'll dunk on your<br/>ass, buddy.")
(15037, "I didn't say nothin'!")
('Kirk', 'Huh? What do you want? Would you mind staying<br/>out of my way?')
('Kirk', "This court isn't for amateurs.")
('Frawla', "Still aloof as ever... Y'know, Kirk, it wouldn't hurt to<br/>let us know how you really feel sometimes.")
('Frawla', "I'll tag along with Simon if he's heading to<br/>the shelter. Helping kids out is my forte!")
('Frawla', "I've known Simon and all the neighborhood folks<br/>basically forever.")
('Frawla', "My teammates are great, too, but the neighborhood is<br/>like one big family. It's really nice when we can all<br/>get together.")
('Frawla', "Tonight, though, I'm heading downtown<br/>with Simon. Gotta celebrate with the team this time.")
('Frawla', "I'm glad everyone's back to normal. Gotta keep the<br/>team's spirits up!")
('Frawla', "I need to pitch in, too. They've helped me<br/>more times than I can count, so I gotta return<br/>the favor!")
('Frawla', "Right, I'd better help out, too. Whatever it takes to<br/>get everybody back on their feet!")
('Frawla', "I've been through a lot myself...but we can't let it get<br/>us down.")
('Frawla', "Sometimes I worry about Kirk, though.<br/>Simon's always saying he's had it easy in life...<br/>Does he know how to handle the rough times?")
('Frawla', "He probably doesn't want me butting in there, but I<br/>want to at least be there if he needs help.")
('Frawla', "Wow, a private school student's playing here?<br/>You don't see that every day.")
('Frawla', "It's nice to sit back and watch other people play every<br/>now and then. Looking forward to this one!")
('Frawla', "Wow, she's good. Really good. I hope I can play like<br/>that someday...")
('Frawla', "Kirk's got talent, but his stubborn streak isn't making<br/>him any friends.")
('Frawla', 'Well, aside from Simon and me, anyway. I guess that<br/>quirk of his is what makes him interesting, heh heh.')
('Frawla', 'He acts all standoffish, but then every so often he<br/>turns into this spoiled little kid. He just REFUSES to<br/>eat peppers, can you believe that?')
('Frawla', "Hey, knock it off! You're better than that!")
(15039, 'Wha—HE started it!')
(15036, "Don't listen to him, Frawla! He's just tilted 'cause he<br/>can't beat me fair!")
('Frawla', "You keep arguing and you're on your own for<br/>dinner tonight. Maybe for-EVER.")
(15039, 'H-Hey, keep the dinner out of this...')
(15036, "Yeah, we're, uh... W-We're still friends! You don't<br/>have to do that!")
('Agnès', '(Huh... The boys hold a lot of respect for her.)')
('Feri', "(Wow. She looks younger than the boys, but they all<br/>respect her. She's really cool!)")
('Aaron', '(Sounds like she rules the roost around here.<br/>Dumbasses all wrapped around her finger.)')
('Van', "(Guess she's the team manager? Interesting buncha<br/>misfits they got here.)")
('Frawla', "You keep arguing and you're on your own for<br/>dinner tonight. Maybe for-EVER.")
(15039, 'H-Hey, keep the dinner out of this...')
(15036, "Yeah, we're, uh... W-We're still friends! You don't<br/>have to do that!")
('Agnès', '(Huh... The boys hold a lot of respect for her.)')
('Feri', "(Wow. She looks younger than the boys, but they all<br/>respect her. She's really cool!)")
('Aaron', '(Sounds like she rules the roost around here.<br/>Dumbasses all wrapped around her finger.)')
('Van', "(Guess she's the team manager? Interesting buncha<br/>misfits they got here.)")
('Simon', 'Hey, thanks for checking up on the<br/>apartments, Frawla.')
('Simon', "Not that I was worried—those guys're tough as nails.<br/>If anybody can fend for themselves, it's them.")
('Frawla', 'Yeah. They were helping each other out, same<br/>as always.')
('Frawla', "Once we're done here, I should head over there to see<br/>if I can help.")
('Kirk', 'Incidentally, you two are from the same complex<br/>downtown, right?')
('Frawla', 'Yup. Different floors, though.')
('Frawla', 'Simon used to come check up on me every now and<br/>then, after my parents died.')
('Simon', "Yeah, I knew her parents pretty well. Funny that<br/>she'd wind up here with me on the team...<br/>Almost sounds pre-destined, doesn't it?")
('Simon', "How about your place, Kirk? I get it's a safe part of<br/>town, but you sure you don't need to check in on<br/>your folks?")
('Kirk', "I'm sure they're fine, but thank you.")
('Kirk', "I imagine they have their hands full, but they don't<br/>need me. And I've been fine without them.")
('Frawla', "Are you...sure, Kirk? You don't look 'fine' to me,<br/>being honest.")
('Kirk', "Wha—I mean... Tch! You think I'd lose my cool over<br/>something like this? Who do you take me for?!")
('Simon', "All right, you two, that's enough! This ain't the time<br/>for mouthin' off.")
('Simon', "Don't think we'll be playin' ball anytime soon...<br/>Things've really gone to shit.")
('Simon', "Just make sure you've got your neighbors' backs, yeah?<br/>Times like these, we all gotta band together.")
('Simon', "Sorry to make ya worry, Kirk. But we're all accounted<br/>for now.")
('Kirk', 'Well, you sure took your sweet time, Simon! I was<br/>starting to get worried.')
('Kirk', 'And the others are all useless out here.')
('Frawla', "Ah, sorry about that. We had a bit of a close call, but<br/>we're safe and sound now!")
('Frawla', 'Certain somebody just had to stop and help<br/>people out.')
('Simon', "Aww, I didn't do much. Just some stuff here and<br/>there—all that basketball's really buffed me up.")
('Simon', 'And I just took a free throw or two with some pots<br/>and stuff—whatever I could find on the street.<br/>That helped distract the bastards a bit.')
('Simon', "I think we got everybody out that we could. I'm glad<br/>you're okay, too.")
('Simon', "And don't sell yourself short—you could've backed up<br/>and ran, but you helped out, too. Good job, bud!")
('Kirk', "W-Well... Duh! I'm not some helpless kid like you<br/>two seem to think!")
('Kirk', "But...admittedly I AM glad we're all here safe<br/>and sound.")
('Mariquita', 'Of all the times, why must Trion Tower wait until<br/>now to reveal its true splendor? How cruel...')
('Mariquita', "Oh, I just can't stop myself. I simply MUST capture<br/>its magnificence!")
('Mariquita', "The world mustn't forget what has happened<br/>here today. I will preserve this chaotic scene for the<br/>future to behold!")
('Mariquita', "I know I shouldn't be poking my head outside right<br/>now, but...I swear to you, I saw something in<br/>the Tower!")
('Mariquita', 'Something strange, something...supernatural!<br/>Words fail to describe it!')
('Mariquita', "Why...? Oh, WHY must I languish indoors, unable<br/>to partake of the tower's beauty?")
('Mariquita', 'I can hardly believe my eyes... Has time truly frozen?<br/>Are my senses not playing tricks on me?')
('Mariquita', 'I shudder to imagine that had I sat there stunned just<br/>a moment longer, I might have fallen prey to some<br/>freakish monster, brush and all!')
('Mariquita', "A dramatic way to go, in retrospect. Poetic, even...<br/>but no. My life's work is not yet done. I will—nay, I<br/>MUST put that Tower to canvas!")
('Mariquita', "Something is...missing, I'm afraid. Something vital.<br/>I had hoped to weave this festive atmosphere into<br/>my work...")
('Mariquita', '...yet still the Tower eludes my brush! Oh, how I<br/>despair...but oh, how sweet the satisfaction will be<br/>when I finally tame it!')
('Mariquita', 'But just what am I missing? What could it be...?')
('Mariquita', 'I had hoped to finish my painting before the festival,<br/>but perhaps it might be better to incorporate it into<br/>the painting instead.')
('Mariquita', "Perhaps this jovial air will shine a light on the<br/>Tower's true colors—a side I've never seen before.")
('Mariquita', "I just have a feeling in my heart of hearts... I know<br/>the Tower's up to something! What spectacle does it<br/>have in store for me?")
('Mariquita', 'The only cure for this ache of mine is to capture that<br/>essence for good and all!')
('Mariquita', 'Trion Tower, your time has come! You will be mine<br/>this day!')
('Mariquita', 'I had to spend a time inside, of course, but I hardly<br/>gave in. What, did you think I would? You<br/>wound me!')
('Mariquita', 'This time! THIS time, I will unveil that je ne sais<br/>quoi, that mystic aura of yours, and display it for all<br/>to see!')
('Mariquita', 'NOOO! I had nearly a fifth of it done!')
('Mariquita', "And now I've gone and spilled paint all over it!<br/>Mariquita, you bumbling swine!")
('Mariquita', 'The Tower eludes me one more day... I curse the<br/>criminals who committed this atrocity!')
('Mariquita', 'When I heard the announcement, I was... I was<br/>overcome with grief. In my anguish, I spilled my<br/>paint bucket!')
('Mariquita', 'What is this avant-garde bilge on my canvas now?<br/>This is no art!')
('Mariquita', "Those fiends who razed the village have TWO crimes<br/>to answer for now. The art community shan't<br/>forgive them!")
('Mariquita', "Mmgh... I just can't do it. Try as I might, the Tower's<br/>mysteries still leave me stumped!")
('Mariquita', "Goodness, it's been...3 years and 67 days now, by my<br/>count, since I last had this severe a case of<br/>artist's block. What's gotten into me...?")
('Mariquita', "I've sunk far too great a cost to turn back now.<br/>I WILL conquer the Tower with my trusty brush,<br/>Goddess as my witness!")
('Mariquita', "If I could just catch the faintest glimpse, the slightest<br/>touch of the Tower's true colors...!")
('Mariquita', "Perhaps I'm looking at it wrong. Maybe I'll know<br/>what the Tower truly is if I know what it truly<br/>ISN'T—its reverse, so to speak.")
('Mariquita', 'If I can change my perception of the Tower like<br/>that...then I may very well have a breakthrough on<br/>my hands.')
('Mariquita', "Hrm... No, it's just... Bah, no, this is a mockery!<br/>This isn't the Tower at all!")
('Mariquita', "I have to put my all into this! I MUST put the<br/>Tower's mystique to canvas, or that Imperial fop will<br/>have me beat at the concours!")
('Mariquita', "I can feel burnout creeping into my body, but I<br/>BANISH it! I can't give out until I've cracked the<br/>Tower's code!")
('Mariquita', "Art is a subtle thing. Behind the obvious shapes and<br/>colors lie abstract feelings and emotions...and that's<br/>what makes artwork so important.")
('Mariquita', 'What may appear unimportant on the surface can turn<br/>out to be vital in understanding the bigger picture.<br/>You need to firmly grasp your subject!')
('Mariquita', "And for me, there's no subject more enigmatic than<br/>Trion Tower. Something about it just speaks to me,<br/>and I'm driven to find out why!")
('Mariquita', "If I can put that abstract quality to canvas, I'll<br/>understand this feeling deep inside me, and share it<br/>with the whole world!")
('Mariquita', "The Tower stands out at night, too. It has this...this<br/>je ne sais quoi. This mysterious aura. It's no simple<br/>skyscraper, that much is clear.")
('Mariquita', 'And see how today the rain shrouds it. See how it<br/>defies our attempts to comprehend it!')
('Mariquita', "But no, I shall not turn away! With my own two<br/>hands and my trusty brush, I shall illuminate the<br/>Tower's secret!")
('Mariquita', "I've put many other skyscrapers to canvas before—the<br/>Great Spire and Orchis Tower, just to name two.")
('Mariquita', "So I dare say there's not a soul more fit for the task<br/>than I. If I can tame Trion Tower, my muse will be<br/>freed at last!")
('Mariquita', 'Hrrm... The Tower plays hard to get once again.<br/>Elusive as ever, the vixen!')
('Mariquita', 'But therein lies the value in my efforts to capture<br/>its essence!')
('Mariquita', 'Just you wait. Though fate may tear us apart for now,<br/>weep not for me today...')
('Mariquita', '...for I shall return in time and tame you!')
('Mariquita', 'For what else can I call the art of exposing your<br/>true nature? Capturing your most primal essence?<br/>Laying your secret bare for the world to see?')
('Mariquita', 'Just as the beastmaster tames the majestic lions and<br/>tigers, I shall bring you to my heel!')
('Mariquita', 'Trion Tower, my respect to you—you have proven<br/>my most challenging foe yet. But that only motivates<br/>me further! I WILL surpass you!')
('Officer Young', "I haven't wrapped my head all the way around our<br/>strategy as of yet.")
('Officer Young', "But the inspector is back in town, and the force is<br/>slowly reassembling. Soon enough, we'll be able to<br/>move out and get to work.")
('Officer Young', 'No matter what comes our way, we still have a duty<br/>to uphold: to protect the people of Edith!')
('Officer Young', 'No offense, but it kinda surprised me to hear that you<br/>guys helped get everything under control.')
('Officer Young', "And not just you, either. Heiyue, the church, even<br/>Crown Prince Sherid... Everybody's pitching in to<br/>take the city back.")
('Officer Young', "You bet we're gonna follow suit—we can't drag our<br/>feet when everybody else is stepping up.")
('Officer Young', "Thanks to you, we've got the police station back—<br/>and after I got back in contact with the force, we<br/>finally got to work together!")
('Officer Young', 'Thank the Goddess I happened to be heading this<br/>way—I was in the right place at the right time.')
('Officer Young', "We're stuck between a rock and a hard place...<br/>Forcing our way into the station is too dangerous, but<br/>we're sitting ducks with Polanski here.")
('Officer Young', 'Maybe this was fated... I almost feel like Aidios<br/>herself guided me here to fulfill my duty.')
('Officer Young', "I'm gonna form up with the hotel guards and keep<br/>this area secure!")
('Officer Young', "This is my first year getting assigned to security detail<br/>for the festival. It's a real doozy.")
('Officer Young', "I've been running around everywhere, helping<br/>everybody with everything...")
('Officer Young', "...but that's my job, after all. I'm here to help the<br/>people of this fine city!")
('Officer Young', "There's still quite a bit more festival to go, so I gotta<br/>keep at the grind until it's all wrapped up!")
('Officer Young', "The festival was already close to the President's heart,<br/>but after...everything, I think everybody's wanted this<br/>even more than usual.")
('Officer Young', "It's been a big ask for us here at the force, but we're<br/>taking it in stride. Everybody old and young is really<br/>putting their backs into it.")
('Officer Young', "We're not gonna let some seedy evildoer undermine<br/>this festival—not after everything Calvard's<br/>been through!")
('Officer Young', "I've heard we're about done rounding up the Almata<br/>stragglers around the capital.")
('Officer Young', "Serves 'em right. Justice always prevails! It's just...<br/>Just a shame we couldn't do anything about it earlier.<br/>All those we lost...")
('Officer Young', 'But it really warms my heart to see the citizens<br/>banding together and keeping things under control<br/>throughout the state of emergency.')
('Officer Young', "Just goes to show that when the police, the bracers,<br/>and the public put their minds together, there's<br/>nothing they can't do!")
('Officer Young', "We're not out of the woods yet, though: we've got the<br/>festival coming up, and that's always a doozy for<br/>us cops.")
('Officer Young', "After everything we've been through, we all need a<br/>break like this. I want everyone to enjoy it to<br/>the fullest.")
('Officer Young', 'I knew Almata were scum, but THIS...?!')
('Officer Young', "Despicable bastards... Goddess have mercy, because<br/>I won't! I say we round 'em up and give 'em the<br/>firing squad!")
('Officer Young', 'The public needs to work with us on this. We have to<br/>take those scum down!')
('Officer Young', 'I know things will get a bit tight under the state of<br/>emergency, but just trust in us to restore order.')
('Officer Young', "So I've been hearing less and less about<br/>Grimcat lately... Wonder what's up with her?")
('Officer Young', "Not that I'm complaining, honestly. I think it'd be<br/>best for everybody if she just up and got gone.")
('Officer Young', "Her being this 'gentlewoman thief' and all makes it<br/>awkward trying to arrest her, because it's still a crime.<br/>Just a celebrated one.")
('Officer Young', "We can't just look the other way when she robs some<br/>fat cat, despite the morality of it all.")
('Officer Young', 'I heard Almata was behind those terrorist attacks on<br/>Basel and Anchorville...')
('Officer Young', "Scum bastards. We gotta tighten up our security to<br/>make sure they won't weasel their way into Edith!")
('Officer Young', 'I did hear, though, that it was a private company that<br/>got Basel back under control, and not the police.')
('Officer Young', "I can't complain, as long as they're keeping the public<br/>safe...but I wish the force could've put on a better<br/>show there.")
('Officer Young', "That new mafia, Almata... They've really gone and<br/>wrought havoc on Edith.")
('Officer Young', 'Those guys have no moral compass at all.<br/>Peddling drugs, extorting money from<br/>innocent people... Tch!')
('Officer Young', "Make sure that you don't get tangled up in one of<br/>their schemes. They're getting more crafty by the day.")
('Officer Young', "Now, we're no strangers to dealing with smugglers<br/>and gangs here in Edith. That just comes with<br/>the territory.")
('Officer Young', "But how're they lighting the whole black market on<br/>fire like that...?")
('Officer Young', "Unless they've got some kinda stash or hideout in<br/>Edith, it just doesn't add up.")
('Officer Young', "It gets quiet around here at night, and that can be a<br/>bit disconcerting, but it's still pretty safe to walk here.")
('Officer Young', "There's this basketball court in the alley over there,<br/>you get some punkish types around there. But they<br/>usually keep to themselves.")
('Officer Young', 'I heard there was a terrorist attack in Seiden a<br/>while ago... Too close to home. Hope we can keep<br/>things under control now.')
('Officer Young', "So you know that Grimcat lady everyone's<br/>talking about? I swear I saw something fitting her<br/>description the other night.")
('Officer Young', "Can't see anybody else just leaping between buildings<br/>like that. I went and reported it, but we don't have<br/>any other leads for now.")
('Officer Young', "People are all, 'She only steals from people who<br/>deserve it!' But a thief is still a thief—she's not above<br/>the law!")
('Officer Young', 'Welcome to the Seiden headquarters of the Edith<br/>Police Department. Whatever you need, from civil<br/>disturbances to full-blown felonies, you come to us.')
('Officer Young', "Crime's been on the up and up lately... Got some real<br/>seedy business ventures in town. We've<br/>been swamped.")
('Officer Young', "So you might need to wait a little bit before we can<br/>get to you, but just give us time and we'll tackle<br/>your problem.")
('Officer Young', 'Seiden District is home to the police HQ, so that<br/>naturally makes it the safest district in town.')
('Officer Young', "I heard other districts haven't been so lucky as of<br/>late—got gangsters pourin' out of the woodwork.")
('Officer Young', "Every district should be as safe as Seiden, that's<br/>our goal. I can't wait to get my own beat and start<br/>helping out.")
('Allen', "I'm seeing taxi drivers and delivery folks are using<br/>their cars to help people out.")
('Allen', 'Man, if I just had a car and a license, I could be out<br/>there helping, too!')
('Allen', "I mean, hopefully this doesn't happen again...")
('Allen', '...but IF it does, having a car for it would be great!')
('Allen', 'I just happened to be passing by, and everybody was<br/>just...stopped. Like time froze or something.')
('Allen', "I hope everybody at the dealership is okay...<br/>The people there at the shop look like they're frozen.<br/>It's really freaky...")
('Allen', "That place has those huge glass windows, so it's<br/>probably not the best place to try to hole up.")
('Allen', "Maaan, those new tanks are baller! I mean, what's not<br/>to love about tanks? They're like big, badass versions<br/>of cars!")
('Allen', "Or, our tanks, anyway. Unlike those Erebonian<br/>models, ours have wheels and not tracks, so they're<br/>closer to cars like that.")
('Allen', "Man, if they can make tanks like that, I can't wait to<br/>see what kind of cars they come up with next!")
('Allen', "The festival really is the end of the year, both<br/>physically and metaphorically. It's out with the old<br/>and in with the new.")
('Allen', "And that means the new model year of cars is<br/>coming up. Oh, man, I can't wait...")
('Allen', "But with the CEO of ETWS getting arrested and all,<br/>that's gotta change the automotive landscape for the<br/>year, no?")
('Allen', "Y'know, that Lugan guy isn't so bad after all. He's got<br/>a lot more heart than I gave him credit for.")
('Allen', 'I feel kinda bad for just taking those Buzzraider<br/>rumors at face value. I judged him unfairly.')
('Allen', "And he can always patch up his reputation out on<br/>the track. He's still the Comet, after all.")
('Allen', "As a Z1 fan and a gearhead, I can't wait to see him<br/>get back behind the wheel.")
('Allen', "D-Did they really just...wipe a whole village off<br/>the map? They're all just gone...?")
('Allen', 'What do I even say...? How do I even FEEL?')
('Allen', "We're gonna keep the store open, of course...but am I<br/>really supposed to just carry on, all casual like I was?<br/>It doesn't feel right anymore...")
('Allen', 'I was chatting with the staff over at one of<br/>the dealerships.')
('Allen', "Apparently Leno's trying to field a Z1 entry!<br/>Whoda thunk? They haven't been competitive<br/>for years.")
('Allen', "I'm not a big Leno guy myself, but more makes is<br/>never a bad thing—especially with factory support.")
('Allen', "As a car buff, I can't wait to see what they've got!")
('Allen', "Word on the street is, Lugan's a bit of a playboy.<br/>Just rumors, of course, but something had to<br/>spread them.")
('Allen', 'That whole thing with him going after that actress<br/>kinda soured my opinion of him.')
('Allen', "He really built up this professional image on the<br/>track, but now he's gone and thrown it all away.")
('Allen', 'You ask me, he shoulda stayed in his lane...<br/>People looked up to the guy, for crying out loud.')
('Allen', "You ask anybody on the street and they'll tell you<br/>ETWS is where the luxury's at.")
('Allen', "But the other companies want a piece of that<br/>market, too. They're putting out their own<br/>high-end models.")
('Allen', "It'll be really interesting to see how they each do<br/>luxury—and you bet I'm gonna be comparing<br/>their specs.")
('Allen', "I heard they're showing 'em off at Basel's motor<br/>pavilion before they hit the market. Man, I'd love to<br/>head over there someday.")
('Allen', "Yooo, that's the new ETWS! I love how they just<br/>casually slid some Z1 car design in there!")
('Allen', "I'm tellin' ya, the world of cars is DEEP. That's the<br/>beauty of it all.")
('Allen', "There's just something really cool about a car that<br/>goes mad fast, y'know? From an engineering<br/>standpoint, it's like a work of art.")
('Allen', "Man, I can't wait to get my license and hit the road!<br/>Though, uh...I can't afford any of those really<br/>cool ones.")
('Allen', 'I feel like cars are starting to become a status<br/>symbol—you gotta have the cash to afford one, right?')
('Allen', "So that's my plan: get my license, scrape together all<br/>the mira I can, and get me the best sports car my<br/>budget will buy!")
('Allen', "...It's just kinda daunting, when I say it out loud<br/>like that.")
('Kanza', 'I managed to take cover, but...man, I had to go and<br/>check on my baby.')
('Kanza', "This cart's more than just a cart to me, y'know?<br/>I'm really happy that it's okay.")
('Kanza', "Come hell or high water, if I've got customers, I gotta<br/>serve 'em.")
('Kanza', 'You folks look like you could use a break, though.')
('Kanza', "Anybody needs my cart, I'll be there for 'em.<br/>Nothing more to it.")
('Kanza', "I wonder how many festivals I've done now...<br/>It's been a while since I moved here.")
('Kanza', 'I get flooded with customers, naturally, so I gotta put<br/>my back into it and whip up the best soba I can.')
('Kanza', 'I really appreciate all those lovely bracers protecting<br/>the city. I hope they get to take it easy now.')
('Kanza', "I gotta do my part to help take the load off<br/>them, y'know?")
('Kanza', "We have to stop Creil Village from<br/>happening again... We're never getting all those<br/>people back. We can't let that tragedy repeat.")
('Kanza', "I might already have a new buckwheat supplier, but...<br/>it's just not the same. I won't forget them. Never.")
('Kanza', 'For now, I just gotta do what I can.')
('Kanza', '...')
('Van', "You were getting your buckwheat from Creil, weren't<br/>you...?")
('Kanza', 'Yeah... It was Creil. They had the authentic stuff...')
('Kanza', 'I remember going there once or twice to meet up<br/>with my supplier... The chief, too...')
('Kanza', "It hurts. It really hurts. But they'd want me to keep on<br/>working in their memory...so that's what I'm<br/>gonna do.")
('Van', '...')
('Kanza', "Creil wasn't just a supplier of buckwheat to me.")
('Kanza', 'Someday, I wanna head there and leave my respects<br/>at their graves. Maybe... Maybe with some<br/>buckwheat soba...')
('Kanza', "Heading to Longlai, huh? Got'cha, got'cha...")
('Van', "Oh, that's where you're from, right?")
('Van', "Figured you weren't from Langport.")
('Kanza', "Yeah, I've got a bit of Longlai in me.")
('Kanza', "Wasn't there all that long, though.")
('Van', 'Makes sense. Guess not everybody Eastern is from<br/>the same place.')
('Kanza', "Longlai's big thing is tea. They're the tea capital of<br/>the world, or so they say.")
('Kanza', "Its unique climate gives it a lot of other unique<br/>stuff, too. It's a place like no other, so I hope you get<br/>to take it all in.")
('Kanza', "Hey there. You're just in time to try some of my new<br/>buckwheat soba. I got the real authentic stuff<br/>this time.")
('Kanza', 'Creil buckwheat just blows me away every time.<br/>I dunno how they do it.')
('Kanza', "With Eastern imports getting harder to come by,<br/>Creil's really the only place to get<br/>authentic buckwheat.")
('Van', "Y'know, I've been wondering: how come you switch<br/>to skewers at night?")
('Van', 'I mean, it still tastes good, but why only at night?')
('Kanza', "I'm a soba man, so that's what I sell during the day.")
('Kanza', 'But I had some regulars telling me they wanted some<br/>skewers to go with their drinks after work.')
('Kanza', "So I threw 'em a bone and here we are.")
('Van', "Damn. That's dedication. Not every vendor goes<br/>outta the way for customer requests like that.")
('Van', "...Hey, so uhh, think you could start stockin' some<br/>Eastern sweets? Customer request.")
('Kanza', 'Sorry, request declined.')
('Kanza', "I'm a soba man and that's all I've got. Sweets aren't<br/>really my forte.")
('Kanza', "If I'm doing a customer request, I wanna do it right.<br/>I'm just not the guy to ask for those, sorry.")
('Kanza', "I hear your clients are keeping you busy. That's a<br/>valuable thing to have at your age—it's good to have<br/>people that trust and depend on you.")
('Kanza', 'Just remember to take care of yourself, too, all right?')
('Kanza', 'Hey there. Been a while, huh?')
('Kanza', "You look like you're in the middle of<br/>something, though.")
('Van', 'Yeah, long time no see.')
('Agnès', 'Oh, is that Eastern-style pottery? And food, too?')
('Agnès', 'Do you come here often, Van?')
('Feri', 'This cart looks really neat. Do you come here a<br/>lot, Van?')
('Aaron', 'Huh. Eastern, but not the stuff I was raised on.')
('Aaron', "Doesn't look half bad, though. I take it you come<br/>by often?")
('Van', 'Every now and then, yeah. The soba and skewers are<br/>really good.')
('Kanza', "I'm happy as long as I have mouths to feed.")
('Kanza', "Come on by again sometime, will ya? I'll throw in<br/>some tasty sides with your meal.")
('Kanza', "I do skewers at night, so if you're in the mood for<br/>those, come swing on by after dark.")
('Reporter Chen', "I'm really trying my best to fill out the Literature<br/>pages, but maaan, it's hard work.")
('Kanza', "Sounds like you've got it rough, bud.")
('Reporter Chen', "Yeah. I guess I'm just an easy target for other<br/>people's work.")
('Reporter Chen', 'Feels like the first time in a while I got to do my own<br/>thing—I met up with this columnist today.')
('Kanza', 'Nice. How about a drink or two to wash it down?')
('Kanza', 'A little buzz can help take your mind off things.')
('Reporter Chen', "Thanks, but I'll pass. I'd love to throw one back, but<br/>my little sister's waiting on me.")
('Reporter Chen', "I wouldn't wanna stay too long and come<br/>back sloshed.")
('Kanza', "Got'cha, got'cha.")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "I'm glad Inspector Daswani made it back. And we're<br/>finally getting reports back from the field, so we<br/>know where our officers are.")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "Our comms are back up, too. Once we're all back in<br/>contact with each other, we're forming up and getting<br/>to work.")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "Since I'm good at coordinating everybody, I'll go<br/>ahead and round the officers up. We need to get feet<br/>out in the field.")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', 'For now, you can leave the cleanup and coordination<br/>to us, all right?')
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "We owe you one, spriggan, for helping free up<br/>the station. But we're not out of the woods yet.")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "We've taken casualties. Still got plenty of officers<br/>holding the line, but we're not at full strength.")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', 'We have to gather everybody up, first and foremost.<br/>Once we get some structure back, security will follow.')
('Sr. Officer Colordo', 'Stay safe out there.')
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "I can't believe Almata would go that far...<br/>The bastards!")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "But we can't give in to fear—that's the whole point of<br/>a terrorist attack. They want us to be afraid.")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', 'We have to restore order ASAP, and the first step is<br/>getting our force re-organized.')
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "It's a huge relief that the festival's going off without<br/>a hitch. Everybody's having a good time, from what I<br/>can see.")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "But that's even more reason not to let our<br/>guard down. We need to make sure it stays safe to<br/>the end.")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', 'You picking anything up, spriggan? Anything feel off<br/>to you?')
('Sr. Officer Colordo', 'Listen, if you catch a whiff of anything strange, you<br/>tell us right away, got it?')
('Sr. Officer Colordo', 'We heard about those Almata remnants swimming<br/>around in the sewers.')
('Sr. Officer Colordo', 'Heard you were there, too, helping out the CID.<br/>Thanks for that.')
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "We've been combing over the place real thorough, so<br/>I want to believe we're finally done with them.")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', 'But you guys seem to have a knack for drawing out<br/>Almata, so if you find anything, let us know.')
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "I did hear from the inspector that you've got a keen<br/>eye for suspicious activity.")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "I mean, I'm not chasing after EVERY lead you give<br/>us, but it never hurts to have more intel.")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "If something feels off at the Revolution Festival,<br/>make sure to call us first, okay? Don't go rushing in<br/>by yourselves.")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "We're making quick work of those Almata stragglers.")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "As for me, I'm collecting intel from reports about<br/>shady businesses in town.")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "Some of those leads are actually payin' off. Helped us<br/>pin down some Almata funding sources in Edith, plus<br/>some of their shell companies.")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', 'All the more reason why doing work on the ground is<br/>so important. Everyday people have plenty to share.')
('Sr. Officer Colordo', 'The inspector says that you guys helped out<br/>some, too.')
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "That said, you can't expect us to just keep our mouths<br/>shut when we see you skirting the law.")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', 'But...well, results are results. I guess I can cut you<br/>some slack.')
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "But you'd best stay on the right side of the<br/>law, spriggan. You don't want the police coming after<br/>you, too.")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "I know you've been talking with Inspector<br/>Daswani, Mr. Arkride.")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', 'And for one reason or another, he trusts<br/>you...somehow.')
('Van', "You sound bitter about it. You don't trust<br/>me yourself? Not that that's a problem...or that I care.")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "...I have to. Being stubborn about it won't get<br/>me anywhere.")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "As my superior, the inspector knows who to trust.<br/>If he sees what you've done out there and finds you<br/>trustworthy, then what he says goes.")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "And at any rate, you're not the real enemy—<br/>Almata is.")
('Agnès', 'Well...')
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "But as a man of the law, there are certain things I<br/>can't overlook. Lines I can't let you cross.")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', 'We DO need all the help we can get, no matter<br/>where it comes from.')
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "And I'd be lying if I said I weren't relying on you...<br/>a little. In a roundabout way.")
('Van', "Let sleeping dogs lie, yeah? We're both workin'<br/>against Almata here, so no point barkin' at<br/>each other.")
('Van', "You got your code as a cop, and I got mine as<br/>a spriggan. For now, those codes're takin' us in the<br/>same direction.")
('Van', 'The enemy of my enemy is my friend, the way I<br/>see it.')
('Sr. Officer Colordo', 'I suppose. Almata is too dangerous, too evil for us to<br/>go making other enemies.')
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "That said, once this Almata business is said and done,<br/>we're putting our sights back on you. Heh, look<br/>forward to it.")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', 'To think we used to just turn a blind eye and let you<br/>shade-of-gray types get off with a warning...')
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "...meh. I can't go ruminating on that. I've got a job to<br/>do, and that's taking down Almata.<br/>Conveniently, they're not gray at all.")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "These guys aren't just criminals—they're a threat to<br/>the whole world. We all need to be banding together<br/>against them.")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "We've been getting a lot of reports about scams and<br/>shady deals. There's always a chance the mafia's<br/>behind those in the bigger picture.")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', 'Folks gotta be careful who they trust nowadays.<br/>We need to get the word out that we can help.')
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "Drying up a crime ring's funding is a good way to<br/>starve 'em out.")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', 'Just so you know, though: if I have to arrest a<br/>spriggan poking his nose into those deals himself,<br/>I will. Are we clear, Mr. Arkride?')
('Sr. Officer Colordo', 'We request that everyone report anything suspicious<br/>they see in town—fraudsters, swindlers, anything<br/>shady under the sun.')
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "You rub shoulders with those types, don't<br/>you, spriggan? If you know anything, make sure to<br/>loop us in.")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "We officers have resources that you don't. If you want<br/>something done right, you come to us.")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "Honestly, though, with the uptick in fraud and scams<br/>lately, I feel like citizens aren't taking street smarts<br/>seriously anymore.")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', 'This is gonna sound a bit morbid, but...those regular<br/>attacks back in the day made everybody more alert<br/>and aware of their surroundings, I feel.')
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "I think with things booming the way they are,<br/>everybody's letting their guard down.")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "Not to say things SHOULDN'T be peaceful, it's just<br/>opening the door back up for lowlifes and gangsters<br/>to take advantage of people.")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "I've dealt with my fair share of reporters in my job,<br/>but that Dingo Brad guy's stumping me. What's he<br/>really after...?")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "He knows more than he seems to let on, from the<br/>times I've worked with him. I don't buy that he's just<br/>some Meld journo.")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "Feels like getting involved with him is only asking for<br/>trouble, though. I'd best keep my distance.")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "There're all kinds of reporters out there, and we need<br/>to make sure to treat them all fairly.")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', 'Some of those guys try to kiss up to us or appeal to<br/>emotion, shit like that.')
('Sr. Officer Colordo', 'But sometimes they just need to back off.<br/>Confidential information is usually confidential for<br/>a reason.')
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "Tharbad PD's been asking for reinforcements.<br/>Apparently there was a big spike in the expected<br/>turnout for the film festival.")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "We're sending a lot of our guys over to be safe.<br/>I'm guessing most of them will be on<br/>investigation teams.")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "That's been happening a lot lately, come to think<br/>about it: got PDs around the country asking for<br/>reinforcements from us.")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "It's good that we've got each other's backs, but I'm<br/>thinkin' we may need to reallocate funding for more<br/>head count and local powers.")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "Backing up local offices when they need it is one of<br/>Edith PD's responsibilities. There's nothing wrong<br/>with it, per se...")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', '...it just brings up questions of local vs.<br/>outsider authority, and how wide we should be<br/>casting our net.')
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "End of the day, we're the biggest force in<br/>the Republic. As its beating heart, we gotta make sure<br/>the whole country's under control.")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "Oh, you're that spriggan the inspector dragged in<br/>for questioning. Twice, if memory serves.")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', 'Mr. Arkride, correct? Just a friendly reminder that<br/>you ARE in our system.')
('Van', "Aww, shucks. You're too kind.")
('Agnès', "Ah. I'm sorry if we caused any trouble.")
('Feri', "But why, though? Van isn't breaking the law or<br/>causing trouble for people. He just has his own way of<br/>doing things.")
('Feri', "Or, wait... Were you breaking the law BEFORE I<br/>got here? Is that how they're tracking you?")
('Aaron', 'Ooh, spicy. Our boss has a criminal record?<br/>You spend some time in the clink?')
('Sr. Officer Colordo', 'Hmph. Shameless to the bone, I see—and your<br/>friends seem aware of that themselves.')
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "I admit, you weren't directly involved with what was<br/>going on, and you didn't TECHNICALLY break<br/>any laws...")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "...but you're walkin' a fine line, bub. You stick your<br/>nose in too deep and you can expect a visit to<br/>the clink.")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "Just thought I'd give you that heads up.")
('Van', "I'll keep it in mind. If you guys keep draggin'<br/>my ass here all the time, it's gonna start cutting<br/>into my bottom line.")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "Honestly, I'd be happy if you did have to walk away<br/>from that little 'business.' But I doubt you care about<br/>what I think.")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "I will say this, though: you only have to screw up once<br/>to land yourself in serious trouble. You can't skirt the<br/>law forever.")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "We're letting you off the hook this time, but don't<br/>push your luck with the law, spriggan. It'll bite you in<br/>the ass one day.")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "The inspector has a lot on his plate. He's getting<br/>ready for a business trip right now.")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "He's always in pursuit of the truth, no matter where it<br/>takes him. He's on countless investigations both in<br/>and out of the capital.")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', 'Meaning he seldom has time to deal with<br/>shade-of-gray types like you. The whole department<br/>would rather you keep out of that business, really.')
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "How 'bout you have a heart and stop tying up our<br/>resources with your stunts?")
('Receptionist Kiara', "We've been able to confirm the situation in each area,<br/>and rendezvous with the inspector and his detail.")
('Receptionist Kiara', 'The veteran officers are really amazing... They put<br/>their lives on the line without a second thought, all<br/>for the people of Edith.')
('Receptionist Kiara', "But I can't just let them do all the work! I'm in the<br/>force, too!")
('Receptionist Kiara', "We've got a plan of action ourselves. For the time<br/>being, I need to provide backup for Colordo!")
('Receptionist Kiara', 'Crazy how fast this is all moving... Just a bit ago, we<br/>were holing up in our armory and holding cells.')
('Receptionist Kiara', "But now that we've gone out and started taking the<br/>city back, we've gotta get a move on.")
('Receptionist Kiara', "Colordo is back on his feet already, so I need to back<br/>him up with everything I've got!")
('Receptionist Kiara', "I may just be a receptionist, but I'm still in the force,<br/>and I still have a duty to fulfill!")
('Receptionist Kiara', 'Up until last year, I was just another civvie enjoying<br/>the festival on the ground.')
('Receptionist Kiara', "It wasn't until I joined the force that I realized how<br/>important their role is during the festivities.")
('Receptionist Kiara', "Everyone's able to relax and breathe easy thanks to<br/>the tireless work the officers do in the background.")
('Receptionist Kiara', "And now I'm one of them—another officer working<br/>hard to make sure folks can enjoy themselves at<br/>the festival.")
('Receptionist Kiara', "I still have a hard time believing the festival's going so<br/>smoothly, after all that...")
('Receptionist Kiara', "I mean, I should know, I'm helping with the whole<br/>thing, but it just...doesn't seem real.")
('Receptionist Kiara', "I'm just glad the people of the city have something to<br/>look forward to again... We all do, now.")
('Receptionist Kiara', "This was my first year with the force. I like to think<br/>I've grown a little so far.")
('Receptionist Kiara', 'Actually, right after the festival is my one<br/>year anniversary.')
('Receptionist Kiara', 'My goals for next year are to broaden my horizons<br/>and learn new ways to help out around the city.<br/>Gotta keep working harder...!')
('Receptionist Kiara', 'And the next step on that road of mine is making<br/>sure the festival is secure!')
('Receptionist Kiara', 'I always knew Senior Officer Colordo was<br/>keeping records on stuff beyond even his usual<br/>investigative work.')
('Receptionist Kiara', 'But I never thought his side notes would end up<br/>exposing Almata collaborators.')
('Receptionist Kiara', 'I guess it goes to show how important it is to talk<br/>with everyday people.')
('Receptionist Kiara', 'Even as a receptionist, I hope some day I get the<br/>chance to go above and beyond the call of duty<br/>like that.')
('Receptionist Kiara', 'I need to do more than just connect with the public,<br/> I need to put their information to good use.')
('Receptionist Kiara', 'Please direct all requests to me, if you would.<br/>The other officers have their hands full right now!')
('Receptionist Kiara', "I'm at a loss for words about Creil, but...this job won't<br/>do itself. We still have to keep the peace...!")
('Receptionist Kiara', "If we officers can keep our chins up, even a little,<br/>that'll go a long way toward giving the public peace<br/>of mind!")
('Receptionist Kiara', "Colordo was saying he has this really important<br/>investigation to coordinate, and it's taking up a lot of<br/>his time.")
('Receptionist Kiara', 'So this is my chance to really step up as an officer and<br/>handle public reports myself!')
('Receptionist Kiara', "Lately we've been getting a lot of reports from<br/>teachers and parents of older children.")
('Receptionist Kiara', "They're telling us about these shady part-time jobs<br/>going around...")
('Receptionist Kiara', "It's a real problem. Good kids can get dragged into<br/>awful bad stuff without even knowing it.")
('Receptionist Kiara', 'Monsters, all of them. We need to round them all up<br/>and get them off the streets!')
('Receptionist Kiara', "Our ties with the CID? Well, I wouldn't know much<br/>about that, honestly—all the groundwork for that was<br/>already laid when I joined.")
('Receptionist Kiara', 'Though I know some of my fellow officers have<br/>some...strong opinions about it.')
('Receptionist Kiara', "But Colordo has quite a few connections in the CID<br/>branch we work with. That's made things<br/>much easier.")
('Receptionist Kiara', "We've had an uptick in reports from victims of<br/>these...just, awful crimes. My heart aches when I<br/>listen to them...")
('Receptionist Kiara', 'They really run the gamut: fraud, assault, gang<br/>violence, business violations...even some strange<br/>reports tracing back to the church.')
('Receptionist Kiara', 'Criminals may be diversifying, but their targets<br/>remain the same: poor, innocent people. Crime<br/>never changes...')
('Receptionist Kiara', "Of course, crime isn't all we handle. We get folks<br/>turning in lost items, asking about public services,<br/>that kinda stuff.")
('Receptionist Kiara', "There's a lot to handle, and it all goes through me as<br/>the receptionist here. I do my best to make sure<br/>everybody's needs are met!")
('Receptionist Kiara', "I try to be clear and concise with people's questions,<br/>so their visit goes as smoothly as possible!")
('Receptionist Kiara', "Colordo's really good at his job... No matter what you<br/>throw at him, he has it all down to a science.")
('Receptionist Kiara', "I can't wait till I become as precise and professional<br/>on the job as he is...")
('Receptionist Kiara', "More and more people are coming into the<br/>station lately... I've gotta step up my game.<br/>They should feel comfortable here.")
('Receptionist Kiara', 'U-Umm... Ah. W-Welcome to the Edith Police<br/>Department Seiden HQ. This is the general<br/>reception desk.')
('Receptionist Kiara', "I've got the paperwork for you right here... A-Ah, if<br/>you wanted to report a crime, I mean. That's right<br/>there, or umm...")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "You're getting ahead of yourself, Kiara. First, figure<br/>out what the person's actually here for.")
('Sr. Officer Colordo', "You've got the passion and motivation. You just need<br/>to dial it back a bit and focus on listening first.")
('Receptionist Kiara', 'Y-Yes, sir!')
('Receptionist Kiara', 'Umm, I have a reception form right here, so please<br/>fill in the details of your inquiry.')
('Receptionist Kiara', "Once I've confirmed your inquiry, I'll get you in<br/>contact with an officer who can help you.")
('Receptionist Kiara', 'If you have any other questions or concerns, we can<br/>answer them here at the reception desk.')
('Sr. Officer Colordo', 'Good. That was much better.')
('Sr. Officer Colordo', 'You sound a lot better when you relax and<br/>speak naturally. Bear that in mind, okay?')
('Receptionist Kiara', "Sorry about that. I just started this year... I'm still<br/>learning the ropes around here.")
('Receptionist Kiara', "But I can't hide behind excuses like that. I have an<br/>oath to fulfill as a police officer!")
('Receptionist Kiara', "Please let me know if there's anything you need!<br/>I need to get used to this so I can help people out as<br/>much as possible.")
('Rumsfeld', 'I heard Cremona and the young miss are safe...<br/>Thank Goddess. I feel a great weight lifted from<br/>my shoulders.')
('Rumsfeld', "So they took refuge at Aramis... That's good.<br/>They should be safe there until this all blows over.")
('Rumsfeld', 'And with them safe, that lets me devote my<br/>undivided attention to protecting the building.')
('Rumsfeld', 'Lord Rocksmith and Elder Gien remain inside—they<br/>need someone to defend them.')
('Rumsfeld', "But I can't help but worry about the young lady...<br/>I had been tasked with keeping her safe.")
('Rumsfeld', "...No. I must focus on the task at hand. I can't let this<br/>old noggin of mine play tricks on me.")
('Rumsfeld', "They've confirmed that the district police stations and<br/>other vital services are under control. That should<br/>allow them to reorganize.")
('Rumsfeld', "I'm worried about the young miss...not to mention the<br/>countless others caught out there. But I can't let this<br/>hotel fall, either.")
('Rumsfeld', 'Until this storm clears, I know what I must do!')
('Rumsfeld', "It puts me at ease to see you safe. We've kept the<br/>hotel under our control so far...")
('Rumsfeld', "...but several guests are still inside.<br/>They're understandably confused—we're still in the<br/>dark, I'm afraid.")
('Rumsfeld', "We've been able to recruit Heiyue, the police, and<br/>several VIP bodyguards to shore up our security, but<br/>our work is far from done.")
('Rumsfeld', 'I can only hope the young miss and Cremona are<br/>safe, wherever they may be.')
('Rumsfeld', 'I worry for Cremona and the young miss...but I<br/>cannot leave my post here at the hotel.')
('Rumsfeld', 'I have a duty to protect the guests here. As much as I<br/>wish to search for them, my fears will have to wait.')
('Rumsfeld', "I won't let these abominations lay a claw on<br/>our guests.")
('Rumsfeld', 'That said...if I may ask a favor of you: should you find<br/>them, please keep them safe for me.')
('Rumsfeld', 'Oh, have you come to enjoy the festival as well?')
('Rumsfeld', 'Cremona and the young miss are attending the<br/>festival together today.')
('Rumsfeld', "She looked to be in high spirits when she went out.<br/>I believe she's been getting along much better with<br/>the president lately.")
('Rumsfeld', "You have my thanks for lifting her spirits... It brings a<br/>tear to this old man's eye.")
('Rumsfeld', "A pity that the president couldn't be here with her,<br/>but their relationship seems to be mended now.")
('Rumsfeld', 'We must accept our own fault in stifling her and<br/>stunting her experiences.')
('Rumsfeld', 'The young miss decided today to tour the festival<br/>with Cremona.')
('Rumsfeld', 'I do believe this will put the wind back in her sails.<br/>The President should be happy with that.')
('Rumsfeld', "We're a touch short-staffed today—Cremona is at the<br/>festival with the young miss. No need to<br/>worry, though.")
('Rumsfeld', 'I had already planned on being down on headcount<br/>for today in advance.')
('Rumsfeld', "We'll still provide our top-shelf service in spite of it.")
('Rumsfeld', "I'll have that cake sent along to your office,<br/>Mr. Arkride.")
('Rumsfeld', 'I do hope you all enjoy it.')
('Van', "Oooh, thanks much. Hope that'll fit in our<br/>fridge, heh.")
('Rumsfeld', "Unfortunately, the President's obligations will be<br/>keeping him away from home for the festival... I fear<br/>the young miss is hurt by his absence.")
('Rumsfeld', "She's taken to poetry, lately—she says it helps her put<br/>her more complicated thoughts into words.")
('Rumsfeld', 'I believe their worries will come to pass. They are<br/>parent and child. If they are open and honest with<br/>each other, all will heal in time.')
('Rumsfeld', 'Though, as things are now, I believe the young miss is<br/>putting on a forced smile. She hides a deep-seated<br/>ache in her heart...')
('Rumsfeld', 'This time of year is quite hectic for the hotel—VIPs<br/>aplenty are booking rooms for the festival.')
('Rumsfeld', 'But after the festival comes and goes, I should see<br/>about bringing the president and the young miss<br/>closer together.')
('Rumsfeld', 'On the surface, the situation has calmed down—the<br/>city is awash with festival cheer.')
('Rumsfeld', 'But the order of events in Oración remains a mystery,<br/>and the government and economy are rife<br/>with turmoil.')
('Rumsfeld', "The President has his hands full trying to navigate<br/>it all... He's told us that he won't be home for the<br/>festival as a result.")
('Rumsfeld', 'The young miss feels as though she only ever sees<br/>him through a screen these days.')
('Rumsfeld', "We've had quite a number of emergency meetings at<br/>the hotel recently.")
('Rumsfeld', 'Though the boardroom is not my place, I would be<br/>honored to assist the president with whatever official<br/>matters he might need.')
('Rumsfeld', 'The President and the young miss finally had<br/>a heart-to-heart. They had a lot on their chests,<br/>it seems...')
('Rumsfeld', 'And, well, perhaps being relieved might be a bit<br/>uncouth of me...')
('Rumsfeld', '...but it puts me at ease to see them finally being<br/>forthcoming with each other, even as these<br/>revelations cause them grief.')
('Rumsfeld', 'This is the first step on the road to a<br/>mended relationship. Now they can begin to heal.')
('Rumsfeld', "In case you were wondering about the young miss,<br/>she was worried that her father wouldn't accept her<br/>feelings... When he found out, he was hurt.")
('Rumsfeld', 'Surprisingly, he took the initiative and reached out to<br/>her himself. She was quite taken aback...but eager to<br/>talk, indeed.')
('Rumsfeld', "I'm not privy to what they discussed...but I don't need<br/>to be. I only need to watch over them and help them<br/>mend their bond.")
('Rumsfeld', 'Come what may, I will keep our guests safe here day<br/>in and day out.')
('Rumsfeld', "We're coordinating a plan of action with Polanski.<br/>Information is scarce, but we cannot act too rashly.")
('Rumsfeld', 'Godspeed to those brave souls out there... It puts me<br/>at ease to know my Edith is in capable hands.')
('Rumsfeld', 'For now, all we can do is wait. We must hold firm<br/>and yield no quarter!')
('Rumsfeld', 'Young miss Berzelia returned home earlier than<br/>usual today...')
('Rumsfeld', 'I do sympathize... She and her father have a<br/>complicated relationship.')
('Rumsfeld', 'Forgive me, young miss... I have failed you. I was<br/>entrusted with your safety, and I could not protect it.')
('Rumsfeld', "My only solace is that the president found an<br/>opportunity to show the young miss his love.<br/>That she's always in his heart, come what may.")
('Rumsfeld', 'I cannot express how deeply it moves me to be able to<br/>help them.')
('Rumsfeld', 'That incident was nerve-racking. Thank Aidios the<br/>young miss has returned safely.')
('Rumsfeld', 'Her relationship with the Presi—her father. I can tell<br/>they care deeply for each other, despite their<br/>strained ties.')
('Rumsfeld', 'If only there were a way for her father to...<br/>demonstrate that to her.')
('Rumsfeld', 'Oh. Hello, sir.')
('Van', 'Hmm? Oh, yeah. Hi.')
('Van', "(Guy looks like a butler or something. What's he<br/>doin' here?)")
('Risette', '(He seems to be waiting for someone.)')
('Rumsfeld', "That staged kidnapping, Desire's betrayal...<br/>These few days have been a whirlwind.")
('Rumsfeld', 'But at the end of it all, I was able to see the young<br/>miss smile in earnest. I could ask for nothing more<br/>than that.')
('Rumsfeld', 'But this is no time to rest on my laurels.')
('Rumsfeld', 'I need to reevaluate our security detail and report my<br/>findings to the president.')
('Rumsfeld', "I do wish he would... No, no, I mustn't overstep<br/>my bounds.")
('Rumsfeld', "I simply can't help but wish they would reach out to<br/>each other. Watching over the young miss has made<br/>me see the clouds within her heart.")
('Rumsfeld', 'Welcome, and thank you for coming to the<br/>Maserati Hotel.')
('Rumsfeld', "If you need anything, don't hesitate to ask the staff.")
('Rumsfeld', 'Our parent company, the Bank of Edith, holds a host<br/>of meetings and other events at our<br/>conference center.')
('Rumsfeld', 'For such occasions, I act as a liaison between our<br/>guests and visitors. If I may help you in any way, you<br/>need only ask.')
('Rumsfeld', 'Hmm. I do wish that the president might... Ah.<br/>Sorry, pay me no mind.')
('Rumsfeld', "I am but one of many entrusted with your visit here.<br/>If there's anything you need, we're happy to help.")
('Rumsfeld', 'In addition to hospitality, we offer other services such<br/>as meetings and catering on behalf of the Bank<br/>of Edith.')
('Rumsfeld', 'The young miss returned to her room earlier than<br/>usual today...')
('Rumsfeld', "It does relieve me, honestly. We've seen some...<br/>unscrupulous activity on these streets as of late.<br/>I'd rather her be here where it's safe.")
('Berzelia', "You promised not to mention that... I just came home<br/>early because there wasn't much else going on.")
('Berzelia', "So I figured I'd just...ruminate to myself tonight.<br/>Everyone needs those nights every now and then...")
('Rumsfeld', 'I see... My apologies. I will respect your wishes.')
('Rumsfeld', 'That said, if I may help you with anything at all, you<br/>need only ask.')
('Rumsfeld', "I've been tasked with seeing to your needs, and that<br/>extends beyond just cooking and cleaning.")
('Berzelia', 'Sure, maybe, eventually. Just...not right now.')
('Berzelia', "Tonight I'm just going to head up and let my mind<br/>wander into the night sky... *sigh* As I always do.")
('Van', "(Those two related or somethin'?)")
('Van', "(She doesn't strike me as just a guest—not with how<br/>they talk to each other.)")
('Van', '(I should make a mental note of that. Might come<br/>up later.)')
('Cremona', 'Whenever the festival rolls around, we get a bunch of<br/>VIPs and other influential guests from every corner of<br/>the continent.')
('Cremona', "It's kind of exciting, honestly. It's not often you get<br/>this many of the world's movers and shakers all in<br/>one place.")
('Cremona', "The festival's our big chance to strut our stuff, and<br/>this year's shaping up to be even bigger than usual.")
('Cremona', 'There was that whole thing with the Quincy<br/>Company in Oración, so a lot of suits and bigwigs are<br/>under investigation right now.')
('Cremona', "I've heard even Hotel Leclerc got dragged into it,<br/>since that was where a lot of them were staying.")
('Cremona', "We've dealt with a few Oración VIPs here ourselves,<br/>come to think of it.")
('Cremona', "...And y'know, I do think they had some shady<br/>business going on, between you and me. Maybe all<br/>that scrutiny is warranted.")
('Cremona', "It just... It breaks my heart. But we can't lose<br/>our way... We have to all band together to<br/>overcome this.")
('Cremona', 'I was actually working here when the war broke out.<br/>A bunch of Calvardian VIPs came here for an<br/>emergency meeting.')
('Cremona', "And now we've got Senator Polanski and others<br/>here. We have to keep them safe and help them<br/>resolve this, ASAP.")
('Cremona', "The Republican Party frequents this hotel for their<br/>meetings—Polanski's a familiar face here.")
('Cremona', "That CEO who just checked out, she's been coming<br/>here more often as of late.")
('Cremona', "And she's far from the only one. A lot of those types<br/>hold meetings here with members of the<br/>Republican Party.")
('Cremona', 'I think those two over there are on a blind date.<br/>See them over there...?')
('Cremona', "She looks like she hasn't gone on that many dates<br/>before...kinda awkward, ish. But there's something<br/>cute about that, heehee.")
('Cremona', "Him, on the other hand... That young man's got it all<br/>figured out. Just look at how he carries himself—a<br/>real cock of the walk type.")
('Cremona', "Even if they don't have the chemistry, it'll still be a<br/>good learning experience for her. It's nice to get<br/>out there!")
('Cremona', 'The young miss would normally be hanging around in<br/>the lobby at this time of day...')
('Cremona', "And she's not in her penthouse either. Where could<br/>she have gone, I wonder?")
('Cremona', "It's a little early for her usual walk, and she's been<br/>gone far longer than usual.")
('Cremona', 'Rumsfeld has been acting strangely, too.<br/>Something smells fishy...')
('Cremona', 'So you see, the young miss is the daughter of the<br/>president of the Bank of Edith.')
('Cremona', "I knew our penthouse had been permanently booked<br/>for ages, but I didn't realize she was outright<br/>living there.")
('Cremona', "I just can't believe they would take advantage of the<br/>young miss like that... The nerve of them!")
('Cremona', 'I was just beside myself when I heard the news.<br/>How dare they play with family ties...?!')
('Cremona', 'This hotel is popular among government officials—<br/>we even have some staying here now.')
('Cremona', 'That did bite us once...twenty years ago.<br/>Several senators were targeted here...')
('Cremona', "We've since upped our security to make sure that<br/>never happens again.")
('Cremona', "Oh, but, err, please don't tell anyone I referenced<br/>that incident. It's a sensitive topic.")
('Cremona', "It WAS twenty years ago, so I don't really think it's<br/>all that big anymore...")
('Cremona', '...but the top brass wanted us to keep quiet for<br/>a reason.')
('Cremona', 'We had SOME security twenty years ago, but<br/>nothing like what we have today.')
('Cremona', "We wouldn't let something like that happen in<br/>today's Maserati. No, sir.")
('Cremona', "Mr. Rumsfeld, he's been a big part of that overhaul.<br/>He was working elsewhere in the Bank before joining<br/>us as head of security.")
('Cremona', 'Welcome to the Maserati Hotel! Thank you for<br/>visiting us today.')
('Cremona', "Our dining hall is open for reservations, if you're in<br/>the market for fine dining.")
('Cremona', "I haven't just rested on my laurels in my twenty<br/>years here. I've polished my skills to a mirror sheen—<br/>you request it, I can handle it!")
('Cremona', "The young miss really enjoyed herself today. I'm glad<br/>I was able to come with her!")
('Cremona', "And I must say, it's a relief to see you talking to your<br/>father more. I can tell it's lifted your spirits.")
('Berzelia', "I-It hasn't! It just...happened to coincide with some<br/>brighter times.")
('Berzelia', "If he truly cared, he'd attend the festival with me...but<br/>of course not. He's too busy for his family. Did you<br/>forget that little detail?")
('Cremona', "I did not. These things will take time, of course...<br/>For now, I'm just happy to see you happy.")
('Cremona', "Now, do you have somewhere in mind you'd like<br/>to visit? Perhaps the Riverside Concert Hall?")
('Berzelia', "Hmm... The Blue Score has an idol concert today.<br/>I'm not too fond of those...")
('Berzelia', "Why don't we tour Aramis instead? I'm set to go<br/>there in a few years, after all.")
('Cremona', 'My, my. Making such forward-thinking decisions at<br/>your age?')
('Cremona', "You're wise beyond your years, I must say.")
('Berzelia', 'Oh, stop it! I just felt like...like, we should go there so<br/>I can get used to it.')
('Berzelia', "And they've got their own festival going on<br/>next month. I'd very much like to go to that.")
('Security Guard Simmons', "I heard they're preparing some sort of counterattack.")
('Security Guard Simmons', "Whatever the case, I've a duty to protect the hotel,<br/>and the Seiden District with it.")
('Security Guard Simmons', "This place is more than just a hotel now—it's a<br/>beacon and a gathering point for the disparate<br/>defenders out in the city.")
('Security Guard Simmons', 'Rumsfeld is taking care of things inside.')
('Security Guard Simmons', "So I'm staying here to hold the entrance, come<br/>what may.")
('Security Guard Simmons', "I never thought I'd fight side by side with Heiyue...<br/>but the enemy of my enemy is my friend. If they help<br/>me uphold my duty, then so be it!")
('Security Guard Simmons', "Rumsfeld's clear coordination has calmed things<br/>down inside the hotel. I owe him for that.")
('Security Guard Simmons', 'That said, I worry what might happen if this draws<br/>on too long.')
('Security Guard Simmons', "We can't have our guests and VIPs getting any more<br/>restless than they already are. We need to act quickly.")
('Security Guard Simmons', "It's an honor to have both President Rocksmith and<br/>Prince Sherid staying with us.")
('Security Guard Simmons', "They've both got their own security personnel, but<br/>that doesn't mean I can ignore my own job.")
('Security Guard Simmons', "They are still guests, and as such, they fall under<br/>my protection. I'm to make sure whatever happens<br/>outside stays outside.")
('Security Guard Simmons', 'We host many government officials and other VIPs<br/>during the festival.')
('Security Guard Simmons', "Rumsfeld just met with Polanski. We've got all our<br/>security measures in place.")
('Security Guard Simmons', "As security, we're here to make sure everyone can<br/>enjoy the festival to the fullest.")
('Security Guard Simmons', "Looks like the situation is all under control...<br/>The hotel itself isn't in any trouble, thankfully.")
('Security Guard Simmons', 'Berzelia seems to have calmed down. She should be<br/>able to enjoy the festival herself now.')
('Security Guard Simmons', "I do hope she's looking forward to it. She could use<br/>the wind in her sails.")
('Security Guard Simmons', "I've been a few times myself, albeit usually on the job.<br/>One of these years, I'd like to go just for pleasure<br/>instead of business.")
('Security Guard Simmons', "We're rolling out new measures here at the hotel, in<br/>compliance with the state of emergency. We can't let<br/>our guard down for even a moment.")
('Security Guard Simmons', 'Rumsfeld has an impeccable service record in public<br/>and private security. I trust him to keep the hotel safe.')
('Security Guard Simmons', 'As his righthand man, I have to follow his lead—<br/>anything to keep our guests and VIPs safe.')
('Security Guard Simmons', 'Little while ago, this kid named Eddy came to<br/>apologize to the young miss—apparently he was<br/>involved in that whole mess.')
('Security Guard Simmons', "We can't exactly let him see her given...everything, so<br/>I just passed his message along.")
('Security Guard Simmons', "Though he DID end up helping her patch things up<br/>with her father, so...all's well that ends well,<br/>I suppose.")
('Security Guard Simmons', 'Our thanks for helping rescue Berzelia.')
('Security Guard Simmons', "For all the trust Rumsfeld put in me, I let him and<br/>the young miss down... I've brought shame to<br/>my post.")
('Security Guard Simmons', "I can't believe it all stemmed from their<br/>family dispute... How did things get so out of hand?")
('Security Guard Simmons', "I'll have to pay more attention to them going forward.<br/>If I weren't so impersonal, I might have been able to<br/>help her...")
('Security Guard Simmons', 'The young miss has been spending more and more<br/>time outside lately. The other day, she all but<br/>vanished—we were all in a panic.')
('Security Guard Simmons', "She came home all right, like nothing had<br/>happened...but it's clear to me she's struggling with<br/>her emotions right now.")
('Security Guard Simmons', "I feel like she's been avoiding us staff lately, too...<br/>I feel like she needs help. Maybe we should reach out<br/>to her...")
('Security Guard Simmons', "Thank you for helping us rescue the young miss.<br/>Really, I can't thank you enough.")
('Security Guard Simmons', "You're a...'spriggan,' was it? I see... Well, if Rumsfeld<br/>trusts you, then so do I. It's good to have you as<br/>an acquaintance.")
('Security Guard Simmons', 'Rumsfeld is out of office at the moment.')
('Security Guard Simmons', 'I can help you with whatever security concerns you<br/>may have—or, if you have a service request, you can<br/>reach out to Cremona.')
('Security Guard Simmons', '(The young miss really worries me lately...<br/>Is everything all right with her?)')
('Security Guard Simmons', '(Rumsfeld left me in charge here, but...would I be<br/>more help out there?)')
('Security Guard Simmons', 'The young miss has been avoiding me lately...<br/>Do kids just find me that scary?')
('Security Guard Simmons', "Oh, well. I can't let that get to me—I still have a duty<br/>to keep her safe.")
('Security Guard Simmons', "She's just at a difficult age. I'll give her the space she<br/>needs, and if she asks for help, I'll step in.")
('Security Guard Simmons', "Welcome to Maserati Hotel. Rest assured, you're in<br/>capable hands with our experienced security detail.")
('Security Guard Simmons', "We serve a veritable who's who of celebrities and<br/>government officials here, so our security is top-shelf<br/>to match.")
('Security Guard Simmons', "You've nothing to fear, as long as I'm on the job.<br/>All you need to do is relax and enjoy your stay.")

('Berzelia', "I'm glad you stuck with it and figured it out!")
('Berzelia', 'Yes, I did get kidnapped, but I got to see that Father<br/>cares about me, so...it was all right. This was a<br/>good year, overall.')
('Berzelia', "I can't have Rummy and the staff picking up after me<br/>forever, though. I need to start figuring things out on<br/>my own.")
('Berzelia', "There's got to be a better way to tell Father how<br/>I feel. Maybe... Maybe a poem?")
('Berzelia', 'This was quite the year, what with me running from<br/>home and all. But I got to see Father actually care<br/>about me, so...')
('Berzelia', "...it's something. I think it'll be a while before he's a<br/>real father to me, but this is progress.")
('Berzelia', 'If I could just find a good way to tell him how I feel...<br/>Something quintessentially me.')
('Berzelia', "Father said he won't be able to make it to the festival<br/>this year...again. I know it's not his fault, but still...")
('Berzelia', "He hasn't completely forgotten me, at least. That's...<br/>Well, that's a good note to end the year on.")
('Berzelia', 'I should just suck it up and tell him how I really feel.')
('Berzelia', 'He dropped everything and called when he heard the<br/>news, in spite of all his work.')
('Berzelia', 'At first, I thought it was all an act. A façade. But no...<br/>He really was concerned for me. Those were his<br/>true colors.')
('Berzelia', 'I should talk with him again, try to tell him how I<br/>really feel... If I could just work up the courage to.')
('Berzelia', "Father's a bit awkward when we're talking, but, well,<br/>I'm hardly one to talk.")
('Berzelia', "I can't believe he just dropped everything to call<br/>like that... He really was worried about me!<br/>He...DOES care!")
('Berzelia', 'Here I thought he always held his business<br/>above me...')
('Berzelia', 'I guess I owe him an apology. Just, how do I put that<br/>into words...?')
('Berzelia', 'Oh, umm, thank you, again. For the other day,<br/>I mean.')
('Berzelia', "I'm sure Eddy would've kept me safe, but still.")
('Berzelia', 'It was all worth it to find out that my father really<br/>does care about me.')
('Berzelia', 'Looking at it like that... Heehee. I think it ended up<br/>being a valuable experience for us all.')
('Berzelia', "I did plan to run away from home for a bit, but I<br/>didn't mean to worry everyone so much.")
('Berzelia', 'Even Father was worried about me in his own way, at<br/>least according to Rumsy.')
('Berzelia', "Now it's just up to me to decide how I want to act<br/>around him going forward.")
('Eddy', "I mean, am I really all right bein' here? I stick out like<br/>a sore thumb.")
('Berzelia', "Oh, don't worry about those prying eyes!<br/>You're welcome here as my friend, so relax!")
('Berzelia', "So, you're planning your exit from Desire, I heard?")
('Eddy', "Yeah. I can't believe Jeffrey was... All of them, really.<br/>Can't believe they're all like that.")
('Eddy', "Looks like they're willin' to let me off easy, so I'm<br/>gettin' out and I ain't lookin' back.")
('Eddy', "I don't wanna be some punk livin' on the edge for the<br/>rest of my life.")
('Berzelia', "Oh, don't judge yourself so harshly, Eddy. You're<br/>no punk!")
('Eddy', "...Wha? Thought that's how I came across, I mean...<br/>Ain't that me?")
('Berzelia', 'At any rate, I find myself in the same boat. I wish to<br/>figure out how I want to live my life.')
('Berzelia', 'Though I doubt Father would respect my wishes, no<br/>matter what I choose.')
('Berzelia', "It's as if I never grew up to him.")
('Berzelia', "*sigh* It's clear to me that Father cares about his<br/>business trips more than his own daughter.")
('Berzelia', "How lovely it would be for him to at least TRY and<br/>reach out to me, while he's off gallivanting around<br/>the continent.")
('Berzelia', 'What am I to him...? Am I just some doll?')
('Berzelia', 'A doll in his dusty little dollhouse?')
('Van', "(Huh... She sticks out. What's she mumblin'<br/>about...?)")
('Van', "(...I see. Might as well make a note of that. 'Rich girl<br/>in Seiden has daddy issues.')")
('Berzelia', "I don't know if I can even trust Rummy anymore...")
('Berzelia', "I'm not a little girl anymore. I won't just trust<br/>anything an adult tells me!")
('Senator Polanski', 'Only Rocksmith could keep Elder Lu that close<br/>without revealing his hand.')
('Senator Polanski', "As the future of the Republican Party, I'd best study<br/>his methods. They'd serve me well.")
('Senator Polanski', "I've gotten my foot in the door with Elder Lu.<br/>Once this mess is over, I'll make my contribution to<br/>the Party.")
('Senator Polanski', 'Seems we still need to address the root of the<br/>problem here.')
('Senator Polanski', 'Fortuitous, though, that Huckberry, Fan, and Prince<br/>Sherid all happen to be gathered here.')
('Senator Polanski', "This is a remarkable opportunity to discuss the future<br/>of our states—I suspect we'll broker many a deal here.")
('Senator Polanski', "Now if I could just have a seat of my own, once<br/>they've cleared up their business.")
('Senator Polanski', 'I never saw anything like this in my wildest dreams...')
('Senator Polanski', "Jennifer lost her cool, I see... She'll need to be more<br/>levelheaded than that if she wants to climb the<br/>political ladder.")
('Senator Polanski', "Though I suppose I shouldn't be too hard on her—I<br/>got the drop on all this from a friend of mine,<br/>after all.")
('Senator Polanski', 'Just another favor I owe to Rocksmith, heh.')
('Senator Polanski', "They say the wise warrior avoids the battle...but I'm<br/>not sure that quite describes him.")
('Senator Polanski', 'Never a dull moment with him, though. That, I can<br/>say for certain.')
('Senator Polanski', "To think he's still going over economics and<br/>investments in spite of it all... Like clockwork,<br/>the man.")
('Senator Polanski', "I've been in politics for decades, you see...")
('Senator Polanski', '...but in all my years, I never expected the world<br/>around us to change quite this much.')
('Senator Polanski', 'It does make me wonder how my colleagues and<br/>rivals are approaching the changing times.')
('Senator Polanski', 'Perhaps I should invite Rocksmith for drinks one of<br/>these days, and we can wax poetic about the<br/>future together.')
('Senator Polanski', 'Phew. I and the political world can finally<br/>breathe easy.')
('Senator Polanski', "Our party does still house some...undesirables.<br/>White supremacists, namely—they're a nasty bunch.")
('Senator Polanski', "One of the party's main priorities is keeping those old<br/>boys in check.")
('Senator Polanski', 'And as luck would have it, curtailing them helps keep<br/>Almata at bay, too.')
('Senator Polanski', "I can hardly fathom the lives lost... We're doing what<br/>we can, but it all feels so small.")
('Senator Polanski', "We haven't even been able to reclaim the bodies...<br/>Horrible, all of it. Just, horrible.")
('Senator Polanski', 'As the representatives of this great nation, our party<br/>must right these wrongs and bring these terrorists<br/>to justice.')
('Senator Polanski', "In times like these, we need to move forward<br/>together, rather than squabbling among ourselves and<br/>jawing with the President's office.")
('Senator Polanski', 'This is quickly becoming an international crisis.<br/>Calvard could have saved a lot of face by taking the<br/>initiative here...')
('Senator Polanski', "As it stands, our investigation is hitting a snag.<br/>We could use some of Huckberry's wisdom to help<br/>shed light on all this...")
('Senator Polanski', "Jennifer has a lot of initiative, and that's good in<br/>a president. I just wish she weren't so rash—she needs<br/>to think things through.")
('Senator Polanski', "Not that she's unwelcome in the party, not at all.<br/>Everyone brings their own skills and strengths to<br/>the table.")
('Senator Polanski', 'Politics is all about connections, you see—and<br/>stringing them together to get what you want.')
('Senator Polanski', 'History is full of fools—perhaps good men—who<br/>tried to move the political world all by themselves.<br/>Seldom do they succeed.')
('Senator Polanski', "I do see that risk in Jennifer at times...but then,<br/>she's still young.")
('Senator Polanski', 'That ambition will help her. You can see plain as day<br/>how much she cares about every issue she tackles.')
('Senator Polanski', 'At the right time and in the right place, she could be<br/>an effective player on the political stage.')
('Senator Polanski', "Now, don't let anyone tell you Jennifer's a<br/>bad businesswoman.")
('Senator Polanski', 'But she does tend to hyperfixate on individual issues<br/>over the bigger picture.')
('Senator Polanski', "Until she can step back and look at broader problems,<br/>she'll find it difficult to work with people.")
('Senator Polanski', 'Jennifer seems to be expecting me to make a move,<br/>announce some big initiative, as the heart of<br/>the party.')
('Senator Polanski', 'But speaking from experience, I prefer not to be<br/>so...rash. The bigger picture is more complicated than<br/>she makes it out to be.')
('Senator Polanski', 'I understand she has her own interests, her own<br/>agenda to push, but she could stand to think a little<br/>more critically about this.')
('Huck', "I'm not saying yea OR nay to this whole 'pork<br/>barrel' business.")
('Huck', "What I WILL say is, the president knows how to use<br/>the mira as a bargaining chip. He's got that down pat<br/>even more than the old administration.")
('Senator Polanski', 'Haha. You never pull your punches, do you?')
('Huck', "Now, there's nothing WRONG with that on paper.<br/>I do that, myself, so I get where he's coming from.")
('Huck', "But when you start throwing money around to get what<br/>you want, eventually you run out of money. Those<br/>reparations won't last forever.")
('Senator Polanski', 'Indeed. And by then, the narrative will have shifted<br/>out of his favor.')
('Senator Polanski', "I've heard the president of BOE saying the<br/>same thing. He was your student, yes?")
('Huck', "Student? Nah, he just hung around my place way<br/>back when. I haven't actually sat down with him<br/>in years.")
('Van', "(Two bigwigs shootin' the shit... Figured they'd circle<br/>back around to politics.)")
('Van', "(Don't wanna stick my nose where it doesn't<br/>belong, though. I'll leave 'em be.)")
('Senator Polanski', "Don't get me wrong, I'm not completely against<br/>his methods.")
('Senator Polanski', "It's just my directive as the leader of the opposition to<br/>find the flaws in his agenda.")
('Senator Polanski', 'Your pardon, Jennifer. Sorry to keep you waiting<br/>like that.')
('President Jennifer', 'Oh, think nothing of it.')
('President Jennifer', "If you don't mind my asking, is something<br/>the matter? You don't seem yourself.")
('Senator Polanski', 'Oh, just waxing nostalgia—we were talking about an<br/>old colleague of mine.')
('Senator Polanski', "But enough about me. Let's get back to the matter<br/>at hand.")
('Senator Polanski', "Our multi-party system is coming undone. If the<br/>minority just mirrors the majority, then they're hardly<br/>different parties at all.")
('Senator Polanski', 'The Patriot League is enjoying a nice boost among<br/>the middle class, what with their pork barrel politics<br/>and local investments.')
('Senator Polanski', "But that's a bit short-sighted, no? Our party should<br/>push for broader welfare, interest control, things that<br/>will help all classes in the long run.")
('President Jennifer', 'S-So, erm... How should we, uh, address<br/>this, Polanski?')
('President Jennifer', "If this keeps up, they'll set their sights on the trade<br/>laws next, and...and...!")
('Senator Polanski', 'Easy, Jennifer, easy.')
('Senator Polanski', "That's a concern, certainly, but not the MAIN<br/>concern right now.")
('Senator Polanski', 'Take a deep breath and think about what you, the<br/>president of your company, should focus on.')
('President Jennifer', 'Okay... Whew... Think, Jennifer, think, what should<br/>I be focusing on...?')
('President Jennifer', "Right now, it's... Keeping the company safe.<br/>Minimizing the damage, and organizing rescue and<br/>cleanup efforts for when this is over.")
('Senator Polanski', 'Correct.')
('Senator Polanski', 'To be a president is to be a steady hand, to be<br/>rational—to analyze the full situation before jumping<br/>to conclusions.')
('Senator Polanski', 'That is what your constituents expect of<br/>you, understand?')
('President Jennifer', 'I... Yes, I understand.')
('President Jennifer', 'I-I need to be focusing on what I can do.')
('President Jennifer', "We're eyeing the global marketplace for our next step,<br/>once we secure our footing here in Calvard.")
('President Jennifer', 'With that in mind, please do prioritize those bills and<br/>amendments when you secure the majority in the<br/>next election.')
('President Jennifer', "We'll support you on our end however we can.")
('Senator Polanski', "Hmm... Yes, fair enough. Your industry presents<br/>interesting opportunities for our party. It's time we<br/>embraced this new economic age.")
('Senator Polanski', 'That said, you need to keep the bigger picture<br/>in mind. If you chase the short-term, you may lose<br/>sight of the long-term.')
('Senator Polanski', 'We can address your immediate legislative concerns,<br/>of course, but we should do so in a forward-thinking<br/>way, no?')
('President Jennifer', "I understand that, but surely we can't overlook<br/>the short-term? The market is awfully turbulent—we<br/>need to strike when the iron's hot.")
('President Jennifer', "Incidentally, erm... I do have these sweets from<br/>Quincy Bell, if you'd like some.")
('President Jennifer', "And for your help, we'd be happy to welcome you to<br/>the Al-Jumeirah Hotel for some well-deserved rest<br/>and relaxation.")
('Senator Polanski', "Oh, give it a rest, Jennifer. Retract that little offer at<br/>once, and I'll pretend I never heard it.")
('Senator Polanski', "You're a talented businesswoman—you should know<br/>better than to butter me up with cheap favors.")
('President Jennifer', "I... You're right. I'm sorry.")
('President Jennifer', 'I got a bit too anxious there... I need to cool my head.<br/>Forgive me.')
('President Jennifer', 'So, Polanski, do you really think the Republican Party<br/>has a shot at taking the chamber back?')
('President Jennifer', "The Patriot League plays everything close to the<br/>chest, and I'm sure you've heard those grumblings<br/>about some mysterious Verne contract.")
('President Jennifer', "I'm worried that we'll be left behind if we don't<br/>follow suit. We have to respond, don't we?")
('Senator Polanski', 'I understand that, Jennifer, but I assure you, the party<br/>is not just sitting idly by.')
('Senator Polanski', 'Look before you leap, as they say. A better<br/>opportunity may be waiting just around the corner.')
('Senator Polanski', 'A politician must be decisive, but not hasty—they<br/>must know when the time is right.')
('President Jennifer', 'Is that party policy, or just your personal approach?')
('Senator Polanski', "Oh, it's just my intuition speaking. I suspect you'll get<br/>similar answers from my fellow partymen, though.")
('Senator Polanski', "We've taken away plenty of hard lessons from those<br/>long years under Rocksmith—to say nothing of the<br/>current administration.")
('Senator Polanski', 'Politics is all about negotiating and bargaining...<br/>You need to know how and when to play your<br/>cards—and indeed, when NOT to.')
('President Jennifer', 'So, on the topic of labor laws, can I count on you to<br/>address those if and when the Republican Party<br/>regains the majority?')
('Senator Polanski', "That's not a promise I can make so easily.<br/>The Republican Party has lost much sway in these<br/>last two years.")
('Senator Polanski', 'Our policy going forward will need to wait in the<br/>wings, potentially for years, and account for how<br/>much strength we have.')
('Senator Polanski', 'And even if we do regain the majority, we need to<br/>focus first and foremost on strengthening our<br/>historical voter base.')
('Senator Polanski', 'Not to mention, there will be years of Patriot policy<br/>to potentially undo.')
('President Jennifer', "I see... Trade laws, I imagine? Or something else?<br/>You don't mean all those laws they rescinded<br/>themselves in the handover, do you?")
('Senator Polanski', "Easy, easy. I know exactly what you're hoping to get<br/>out of this alliance.")
('Senator Polanski', 'But legislation is not too easily rushed. We will need<br/>time, both to PLAN our strategy for retaking the<br/>majority, and to actually DO it.')
('Senator Polanski', 'Politics are all about the long term, the big picture.<br/>Our decisions always take that into account.')
('President Jennifer', 'Communications have been restored, thankfully, so<br/>the districts can coordinate between each other now.')
('President Jennifer', 'Did you see Rocksmith, though? He was together<br/>with that elder from Heiyue, still casual like he<br/>always is. He just has this aura about him.')
('President Jennifer', "I can't believe Polanski can even stand to be<br/>near them... I would buckle from the pressure,<br/>no doubt.")
('President Jennifer', "Hmm... But I can't shy away from that, can I?<br/>I should learn from how he does it, not just look the<br/>other way.")
('President Jennifer', 'From what the police and Heiyue have told me, the<br/>company building is still okay.')
('President Jennifer', "But I just... I don't know where to go from here.<br/>What am I supposed to do in a situation like this?")
('President Jennifer', "...No, no, I can't lose my head! Think, Jennifer, think.")
('President Jennifer', "I'm... I'm just losing all control out here. This is bad...")
('President Jennifer', "What do I even do? Comms are down, we can't go<br/>outside, we're cut off from everywhere else...")
('President Jennifer', "I have no idea what's going on at the company—is<br/>our building even still standing?")
('President Jennifer', "(I'd expect nothing less than that from Mr.<br/>Huckberry, but I can't let him show me up!)")
('President Jennifer', "(I can't let everything Polanski taught me go to waste.<br/>I can do this... Just stay focused!)")
('President Jennifer', "Polanski's right: it really does pay off to step back and<br/>look at the big picture, especially at a time like this.")
('President Jennifer', 'The festival is an excellent opportunity to connect<br/>with politicians and string together a network of<br/>my own.')
('President Jennifer', "No need to focus all my attention on Polanski.<br/>I'd rather find a more...agreeable senator to<br/>schmooze with.")
('President Jennifer', 'Right. Time to put his advice into practice!')
('President Jennifer', "My head just can't keep up with Polanski and<br/>their types. He was there to cool my head when I lost<br/>it back there.")
('President Jennifer', "Where would I be without his advice...? I can't deny<br/>it's kinda bearing down on me. Like I can't manage<br/>on my own.")
('President Jennifer', 'I need to learn from him, learn to look at the bigger<br/>picture before I go making big decisions.')
('President Jennifer', "I just don't know how he does it. He seems to have it<br/>all figured out, in spite of everything going on.")
('President Jennifer', 'He even predicted some of his colleagues would break<br/>off from the party!')
('President Jennifer', "He's far more savvy than I thought... And to think he<br/>wants to take me under his wing.")
('President Jennifer', "I thought it would be easy to win over some party<br/>members, given the slump they're in... How wrong<br/>I was.")
('President Jennifer', 'And he has such a big heart, to set me straight<br/>like that.')
('President Jennifer', "It's strange. Even the sweetest Quincy treat tastes<br/>salty when I eat it alone. *sigh*")
('President Jennifer', "I can't believe myself. Did I really just try to do that?<br/>And how low will I sink if I don't put a stop to it...?")
('President Jennifer', "But I've made this bed—now I have to lie in it.<br/>Our actions at the bank have all boiled down to<br/>winning the Republican Party's favor.")
('President Jennifer', 'If we were to convince them to amend those trade<br/>laws, the market would be all but ours after the<br/>next election. I guess I let that...blind me.')
('President Jennifer', "(Grr... That old fox thinks he's some big shot just<br/>because he's cushy with Rocksmith!)")
('President Jennifer', "(He's about as far across the aisle from Rocksmith as<br/>one could possibly be...but he could be my in.)")
('President Jennifer', '(Wait, is that...President Huckberry? He and<br/>Polanski look thick as thieves over there.)')
('President Jennifer', '(Why would Polanski just let an obsequious weasel<br/>like him into his inner circle?!)')
('President Jennifer', '(He should be more concerned about his own hide!<br/>The times will leave you behind, old dog!)')
('President Jennifer', '(Is this really how my career goes down the drain?<br/>All because some old fogey only wants a friend<br/>his age?!)')
('President Jennifer', "The Republican Party should still have strong support<br/>and funding from their old regime, but they're on<br/>the downswing.")
('President Jennifer', 'With how aggressive the Patriot League is, the<br/>Republican Party could stand to rally their own<br/>voter base.')
('Manager Mohra', "We finally heard back from everybody. Our part-timer,<br/>Carol, she's okay—and we've confirmed some<br/>of the other industry folks are all right.")
('Manager Mohra', "There's still hope... We can't lose it here.<br/>They're saying we're close to a breakthrough.")
('Manager Mohra', "I'd be fine if they postpone the EGC, just as long as it<br/>eventually goes through.")
('Manager Mohra', 'The hopes and dreams of people everywhere are<br/>riding on that show—not to mention my own. I just<br/>hope we can hold on to it...')
('Manager Mohra', 'I had put my all into the EGC... Why did things have<br/>to turn out like this?')
('Manager Mohra', 'I imagine the staff there are all frozen, too.')
('Manager Mohra', "I'm the only one who can still move... A cruel<br/>coincidence, maybe.")
('Manager Mohra', "All I can do for now is provide shelter and send<br/>supplies to the front. I hope that's enough...")
('Manager Mohra', "Oh, I'm just glad everybody can come out and enjoy<br/>the festival this year.")
('Manager Mohra', "I was worried it'd be a bit of a downer, after<br/>everything, but I guess we're all starting to heal.<br/>That puts me at ease.")
('Manager Mohra', 'The way things are going, I think the EGC will be a<br/>real showstopper tonight.')
('Manager Mohra', "This newest gown was made with a theme of 'hope'<br/>in mind... I think that's particularly<br/>relevant nowadays. I know it'll be a hit!")
('Manager Mohra', "I'm just so glad the EGC is still going forward, along<br/>with the festival.")
('Manager Mohra', "It's part of my life's work, you know? And our theme,<br/>hope, is really relevant this year. Everybody could use<br/>a little hope right now.")
('Manager Mohra', 'I hope myself that the festival is a sign of better<br/>things to come next year.')
('Manager Mohra', "The tragedy has come and gone...but the lives<br/>we lost? They're... They're never coming back...")
('Manager Mohra', "We can't forget them...not ever. We have to keep<br/>them in our hearts.")
('Manager Mohra', "I've been to that village, and I'll never forget the<br/>harmony it had.")
('Manager Mohra', "I want to work that harmony into my<br/>clothing designs... It's the least I can do in<br/>their memory.")
('Manager Mohra', 'Why...? Why Creil? What did they ever do wrong...?')
('Manager Mohra', 'I remember going there once or twice, on my trips<br/>to Remiferia... It was such a wonderful place.')
('Manager Mohra', 'And now those terrorists have killed that<br/>beauty forever... I want to cry.')
('Manager Mohra', "Lulua's going to take Daphne to the place she<br/>works tonight.")
('Manager Mohra', 'What was it, the, umm...the Riverside Concert Hall?')
('Manager Mohra', "Those two seem like they're getting along pretty well...")
('Manager Mohra', "But isn't it a tad contradictory that a 'volunteer' like<br/>Lulua charges money for her services?")
('Manager Mohra', "I've heard that other countries look to Calvard for the<br/>newest fashion trends. Our diversity brings a lot of<br/>unique flair to the scene.")
('Manager Mohra', "That's part of what makes designing clothes so<br/>interesting—not just for the EGC, but for store<br/>brands, too.")
('Manager Mohra', "You've got traditional stuff from Oración, Central<br/>and Far East trends...and then there's Edith, which is<br/>like this big melting pot.")
('Manager Mohra', "That's my job: bridging all those unique cultures, and<br/>bringing them together to make something new!")
('Manager Mohra', "They say how you dress is an extension of your<br/>personality, and I'm inclined to agree.")
('Manager Mohra', "But all the same, Calvard's fashion trends sorta...<br/>stifle people. Bind them to whatever's hot at the time.")
('Manager Mohra', "That's why I aim to create clothing that helps bring<br/>out people's true natures, regardless of what's hip<br/>or trendy.")
('Manager Mohra', "Carol's taking a break today.")
('Manager Mohra', "Evidently there's something going on at the<br/>sharehouse in Old Town.")
('Manager Mohra', "One look at her outfits lately tells me something's<br/>weighing heavy on her mind... I just don't<br/>know what.")

('Manager Mohra', 'I was actually involved with the very first EGC—it<br/>was a very formative experience for me.')
('Manager Mohra', 'In a roundabout way, I have the EGC to thank for<br/>launching my own career.')
('Manager Mohra', "Fashion isn't all about looks, y'know. It's about how<br/>you feel, how you express your inner self.")
('Manager Mohra', "That's the secret to looking good: you gotta<br/>FEEL good. That's what gives lookers their...<br/>well, looks!")
('Manager Mohra', "And it is fashion itself that draws out this taste.<br/>That's the real point: to make people feel comfortable<br/>in their own skin.")
('Manager Mohra', 'Welcome to Erland. We have outfits for the<br/>discerning lady and gentleman.')
('Manager Mohra', 'Our clothes suit any age and gender, hand-crafted<br/>with our philosophy in mind.')

('Eddy', "I mean, am I really all right bein' here? I stick out like<br/>a sore thumb.")

('Berzelia', "So, you're planning your exit from Desire, I heard?")
('Eddy', "Yeah. I can't believe Jeffrey was... All of them, really.<br/>Can't believe they're all like that.")
('Eddy', "Looks like they're willin' to let me off easy, so I'm<br/>gettin' out and I ain't lookin' back.")

('Carol', "Welcome. We're still open here, for the time being.")
('Carol', "We hope we don't have to close up shop, but the way<br/>things are going, we just can't say anything<br/>for certain...")
('Carol', 'Please be careful out there.')
('Carol', "At this rate, it's a coin flip whether or not the EGC<br/>goes forward at all...")
('Carol', 'Be careful out there, all right?')
('Carol', 'The amazing thing about the EGC is that all the<br/>clothes you see the models wearing, you can go and<br/>buy for yourself.')
('Carol', "So it's more like an expo than a fashion show, and it's<br/>big PR for the brands. In the fashion industry, it's one<br/>of the biggest events of the year.")
('Carol', "I'll be doing more than just attending this year—I'm<br/>helping out as a staff member!")
('Carol', 'Just two months left until opening day... I gotta<br/>work hard. This needs to be everything that a girl<br/>could dream of!')

('Aaron', "Oho. Some bougie brands here. Maybe I'll find<br/>something on clearance.")
('Van', "Sure, why not? I'll take a look around.")
('Carol', "Our manager also helped launch the Edith Girls'<br/>Collection, or EGC. Now it's the biggest fashion<br/>event in the capital!")
('Carol', 'That earned her the moniker of Dream Weaver, both<br/>for her fashion sense and for her own beauty.')
('Carol', "She's every bit as knowledgeable as the name<br/>implies, heehee. She's still an EGC mainstay.")
('Huck', "Couldn't help overhearing your plans. You're breaking<br/>through the line out there, eh?")
('Huck', "I hate to have to drop this whole thing in your laps,<br/>but right now, it seems like you're our best bet.")
('Huck', "Just promise me you'll come back in one<br/>piece, okay?")
('Huck', "And when this is all over, let's soak our worries<br/>away in the bathhouse!")

('Agnès', "You stay safe, too, Huck! We're counting on you!")
('Huck', "I'm worried sick for Paulette and Yumé, but it's too<br/>dangerous to go out looking now. We need to wait...")

('Huck', "Even if we stamp them out, they'll just keep coming<br/>back... Bah. No sense thinking about that. We just<br/>need to focus on saving everybody we can.")
('Huck', 'Good luck out there, your highness! And Van!<br/>You take care of Judith, you hear me?!')
('Van', 'Yeah, yeah! You hold down the fort here, all right?')
('Prince Sherid', 'Rest assured, we will put this madness to an end!')
('Huck', "We'll hold down the fort here and keep an eye out for<br/>anybody caught up in the crossfire.")
('Huck', 'We need to find a way out, ourselves, eventually...')
('Huck', "You kids take care out there. We'll be praying for you!")
('Huck', "Those association banquets are good food and all, but<br/>I just can't stand those old far... Sorry, 'legacy VIPs.'")
('Huck', "But it's the party afterwards I'm looking forward to<br/>the most. Heh, c'mon, let's get the lead out!<br/>Time's a-wasting!")
('Van', "Just don't go gettin' yourself into trouble, Huck.")
('Huck', "Now, I'm no diplomat, but I have an idea of how<br/>this'll impact the marketplace...and I don't like where<br/>it's headed.")
('Huck', 'The markets are like horses—they spook real easily.<br/>You get a big incident like this and futures plummet.')
('Huck', 'I can only hope they get it all resolved soon...<br/>How they can even do that, though, is beyond me.')
('Huck', 'Insurance companies are all on fire right now.<br/>That can bleed over into other sectors pretty quickly<br/>if it keeps up...')

('Huck', "Van, m'boy! What brings you here today?")
('Huck', "I'll be having some senators over for a meal...<br/>Good networking, but man, these stuffy<br/>meetings just drive me up the wall.")
('Van', 'Coulda fooled me. You look chill as ever.')
('Van', "(First time I've seen Huck in a suit. Y'know, he looks<br/>presentable—for once.)")
('Huck', 'They want me at the next banquet, huh? *sigh* Pain<br/>in my... I mean, what do they REALLY need my old<br/>ass there for?')
('Senator Polanski', "Moderation in everything, Mr. Huckberry. Even in<br/>your golden years, you shouldn't let go of<br/>your obligations.")
('Senator Polanski', 'You may be interested to hear, however, that the<br/>venue has some fetching ladies in charge of<br/>the hospitality.')
('Huck', "...Well, why didn't you say so?! Let's go, let's go,<br/>heh heh! Hell, why don't we kick it off an hour early<br/>this time?")
('Senator Polanski', 'Still cavalier to a fault, eh, old friend?')
('Van', "Hey. Just wanted to let you know we got Dingo's<br/>notebook back.")
('Giordano', "Glad to hear it. It's something worth hangin' on to.")
('Giordano', 'I came across all kinds of people when I was still<br/>working underground.')
('Giordano', "But seein' Dingo off in Creil's gonna stick out for the<br/>rest of my life.")

('Giordano', "Startin' to feel like a good time to go out for drinks.")
('Giordano', 'Whaddaya say you join me, big boy?')
('Van', 'Gonna pass on this one. Maybe some other time.')
('Giordano', "Hahaha, I know you're just messin' with me!<br/>Come on, let's have some fun!")
('Giordano', "Well, big man...I'm just glad Dingo got that to you in<br/>the end.")
('Giordano', "I'll pour one out for him tonight... It's the right thing<br/>to do.")
('Giordano', 'All I had for you was that key, big man.')
('Giordano', 'You just make sure you find whatever it was Dingo<br/>wanted to get to you.')
('Giordano', "Whew! Love this place. Can't have real Eastern soba<br/>without the WA-SA-BI!")
('Giordano', "How 'bout it, brothers? Care to take a seat and throw<br/>one back with your boy?")
('Van', 'Sorry, gonna have to take a rain check on that.<br/>Got some stuff to do today.')
('Giordano', "Well, I'm beat. Spent the whole day playin' third<br/>wheel on that couple's date.")
('Giordano', 'Had a meal at a real nice place, threw some dough<br/>around at the shops, watched a cool sunset...<br/>The whole nine arge.')
('Giordano', "Just glad we got 'em back to the hotel before the<br/>weather turned.")
('Giordano', "I think I've earned myself a break after all that.<br/>Might spring for a kebab at that stand over there, that<br/>stuff smells di-VINE.")

('Barker Tracey', 'Awright, this looks like a good spot for<br/>some hawking!')
('Barker Tracey', "Can't ruffle too many feathers, though. Police HQ's<br/>right over there.")

('Transcent', "I tell you what, Verne stocks've been on a real roller<br/>coaster ride lately. It's making my head spin.")
('Transcent', 'One minute they have Elsaim cash out the wazoo for<br/>that film festival. Next, their subsidiary gets slapped<br/>with a patent lawsuit.')
('Transcent', "They've got a high floor thanks to their federal<br/>contracts, but man, they've been putting out fires left<br/>and right.")
('Transcent', 'And those reparation funds are a ticking time bomb.<br/>Once they dry up, all those stocks could go kaput.')
('Transcent', "Their CEO is... Well, let's just say he doesn't have<br/>the best reputation on the market floor.")
('Transcent', "He's a real knee-jerk kinda guy, always moving to put<br/>out fires in the short term at the expense of the<br/>long term. It's bad for stability.")

('Reporter Langdon', 'So, should I take that statement as the view of the<br/>Patriot League and not the president?')

('Aaron', "Sounds like the CID's really siccin' the hounds.<br/>Hard to blame them.")
('Van', 'Yeah, that checks out. After the shitshow in Basel, I<br/>bet the CID wants these guys gone.')
('Quatre', "That's good to hear...but I'm still bothered that we<br/>have no intel on them in terms of motives or<br/>end goals.")
('Bracer Alvis', "Yeah. And what's also weird is, Messeldam's calmed<br/>down a lot. You'd think they'd be ramping UP their<br/>activities there, right?")

('Elite-Looking Young Adult', "(Well, we're still not out of the woods, at any rate.<br/>I need to do my part, too!)")
('Ms. Sonia', "Tch. If I knew this was gonna happen, I'd have<br/>brought my trusty sword.")
('Ms. Sonia', "You don't scare me! I've been beating you bastards<br/>down since I ran with the Stegoros!")
('Elite-Looking Young Adult', 'Thank you very much for meeting with me today,<br/>Ms. Sonia.')
('Elite-Looking Young Adult', "I do apologize. My parents have been trying to marry<br/>me off as of late... They're getting<br/>quite heavy-handed.")
('Ms. Sonia', "They're putting that on your back at twenty-five?<br/>That's rough...")
('Ms. Sonia', "And you're still aiming for the Ministry of Home<br/>Affairs, aren't you? You're really shooting<br/>for the moon!")
('Elite-Looking Young Adult', "Oh, no, I'm sure there are plenty of others more<br/>suited for the role than I.")
('Elite-Looking Young Adult', 'Well, no sense standing here chatting all day.<br/>Shall we take a little trip around town?')
('Elite-Looking Young Adult', "I've booked us a nice table for dinner, but I'd like to<br/>hear first where you might want to go.")
('Ms. Sonia', 'Oh, of course!<br/>(Nice, got my festival date locked in!)')
('Ms. Sonia', "(And with some nice arm candy, to boot. He's young,<br/>he's handsome, he's high-class...)")
('Ms. Sonia', "(That's the whole package right there!)")
('Elite-Looking Young Adult', 'I apologize, I really should have asked you earlier.')
('Elite-Looking Young Adult', "Is there anywhere in particular you'd like to go,<br/>Ms. Sonia?")
('Ms. Sonia', "(Oh, man! Oh, man! Oh, man! He's even asking me<br/>what *I* want, even though he already had a plan!<br/>Green flag, baby!)")
('Ms. Sonia', "(Age? Check. Looks? Check. Status? Check.<br/>Personality? BIG ol' check. This one's a keeper and<br/>you bet your ass I'm keeping him!)")
('Ms. Sonia', "*hic!* I said SCREW guys! Who says I gotta marry<br/>one just 'cause I'm 'thaaat aaage' and... *hic!*")
('Ms. Sonia', "Not like I'm gonna just curl up and DIE if I'm single<br/>in my thirties! *hic!*")
('Ms. Sonia', "AwwRIGHT! Y'all, tonight we're gonna drink till I<br/>forget alllll abouddit!")
(15200, "Oh, wow. You're a teacher at Aramis?<br/>That's incredible!")
('Ms. Sonia', "Oh, haha! It's really no big deal. My career's only just<br/>getting started!<br/>(Even though I'm in my thirties...)")
(15200, 'Your students are in good hands, I bet, with a teacher<br/>like you.')
(15200, "I must say, you've piqued my curiosity, my fair lady.")
(15200, 'What do you do when a particularly...naughty<br/>student misbehaves? How do you rein them in?')
('Ms. Sonia', "Oh, well, I teach PE, so it's mostly just physical stuff.<br/>I call them out and have them do thirty laps around<br/>the grounds.")
('Ms. Sonia', "Buuut I've always got my trusty wooden sword on<br/>hand, too, so as long as I don't go totally corporal on<br/>their—")
(15200, 'Wha...?')
('Ms. Sonia', 'Oh. Oh, no.')
('Ms. Sonia', "(AAAH, now I've gone and done it!<br/>Should've kept my stupid mouth shut!)")
('Agnès', "(What's Ms. Sonia doing here...?)")
('Van', "(Single 'n' mingling, if I had to guess. Looks like it<br/>ain't goin' so hot, though.)")
(15200, 'A...wooden sword? Did I hear that right?')
('Ms. Sonia', "(I'm DEAD! I am SLAIN! Three months biding my<br/>time for a hot date and I BLEW IT! Aidios,<br/>smite me!)")
('Elite-Looking Young Adult', "M-Ms. Sonia?! What are you... N-No, never<br/>mind that. It's dangerous, we need to get inside!")
('Elite-Looking Young Adult', 'My thanks for the rescue, though! Truly!')
('Ms. Sonia', 'Buzz off, small fry!')
('Ms. Sonia', "One 'a you so much as touches anybody and<br/>I'll freakin' rip your limbs off!")
('Elite-Looking Young Adult', "(Wh—Who is THIS?! Surely this isn't the lady I just<br/>talked to?)")
('Elite-Looking Young Adult', "(I-I mean, I do appreciate her protection, but just...<br/>Is this what they mean by 'crouching tiger'?!)")
('Agnès', '(Is that really the same Sonia?)')
('Van', '(Oh, yeah. I heard about her. Loses it at the drop of a<br/>hat and goes ham on her students. Real<br/>loose cannon.)')
('Judith', "I told the press I'd be lying low for the time being,<br/>mainly with Nina and the others.")
('Judith', "But I think I'm gonna tag along with you today, so let<br/>me know if there's anything you need me for.")
('Rocksmith', "Well, less than an hour until it's go time. Let's make<br/>sure everything is in order.")
('Senator Polanski', "Right. We've already secured supplies and emergency<br/>funds on our end.")
('Senator Polanski', "We'll need to think about cleanup, too, among other<br/>things I'm sure I'm forgetting.")
('Van', "Yeah, I dunno all the nitty-gritty stuff, so I'll leave<br/>that to you suits.")
('Rocksmith', "Much obliged. Once you're ready, make for<br/>Expressway 1.")
('Rocksmith', 'They should have everything ready for you there.<br/>And Agnès...please do take care of yourself.')
('Agnès', "I will, don't worry! We leave the rest to you!")
('Rocksmith', 'They may not be my constituents anymore, but I still<br/>care deeply for the people of Oración. You have my<br/>thanks for your help there.')
('Rocksmith', "I believe that the future of this country is in good<br/>hands, with your generation on the horizon. I'll have<br/>to pass that along to Kilika, haha.")
('Rocksmith', 'Funny that we would run into each other under<br/>such...bizarre circumstances.')
('Rocksmith', "Two years is far too long, old friend. It's good to see<br/>you again.")
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', "You can say that again. Haven't seen you since I<br/>stepped off that stage.")
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', "It's important to keep on good terms with<br/>the principality. Can't leave it all up to my son, can I?")
('Rocksmith', 'Haha. Fair enough.')
('Senator Polanski', "(He really does know about that thing with Elsaim?<br/>Yeesh... But, well, he IS an elder. I guess that's to<br/>be expected.)")
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', "Anyway, who's this with you? I feel like I've seen him<br/>somewhere before.")
('Senator Polanski', "Ah, Elder Gien Lu. I believe this is the first<br/>we've met.")
('Senator Polanski', 'My name is Polanski, of the Republican Party.<br/>Pleased to make your acquaintance.')
('Rocksmith', "He's quite the hard worker, you see. As the minority<br/>leader, he has his hands full, but he's holding his own<br/>quite well.")
('Rocksmith', "I had hoped I could introduce you to Ryan Connery<br/>as well, he's one of our newer members...but alas.")
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', "Ahh, yes. MacDowell's son-in-law, correct?")
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', "He was a bit...bland, when I met him, but he does<br/>offer some sharp political insight. I wouldn't mind<br/>talking with him again.")
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', 'Perhaps once this mess is over, we can all sit down for<br/>a chat.')
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', "You'd be more than welcome to join us,<br/>Mr. Polanski.")
('Senator Polanski', 'O-Oh! Well, it would be my pleasure! Thank you<br/>very much.')
('Rocksmith', 'Hahaha! Look at you, Polanski!')
('Van', "(That old fox, workin' his magic as always.)")
('Van', "(Man's starin' Heiyue dead in the face, and he's still<br/>makin' connections all casual.)")
('Agnès', "(It's always daunting to see politicians at work.<br/>They're strong and steadfast, just like Father.)")
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', "Of course, standing around here chatting won't make<br/>a lick of difference until we get this cleared up.")
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', 'Heiyue will assist, of course. Cao and my son are out<br/>there in the field.')
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', "I'll leave the rest to you, spriggan and company.")
('Aaron', "Don't gotta tell me twice.")
('Nina', 'Sorry for startling you earlier.')
('Nina', 'It looks like Saara and the hotel staff have got the<br/>evacuees calmed down, though. Good...')
('Nina', "I should go ask if there's anything I can do to help.")
('Nina', 'Please be careful out there... Come back safe, okay?')
('Nina', 'I was just shocked to hear what happened<br/>with Dingo...')
('Nina', 'Seeing Marielle pull herself back together and press<br/>on just... It gave me the strength to carry on, too.')
('Nina', 'I really admire her. She never gives up, no<br/>matter what.')
('Nina', 'I want to learn how to be like that, and still support<br/>everyone in my own way.')
('Nina', 'Please take care of her for me, Mr. Arkride.')
('Nina', "She—Judith, I mean—is the brightest star in film.<br/>We can't lose her.")
('Nina', "I mean, compared to her, I'm just...")
('Van', 'Hey!')
('Agnès', 'Nina?!')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Are you okay? Is something wrong?')
('Nina', "Oh, no, it's all right. I just got a little light headed.")
('Nina', 'To be honest, I hardly slept a wink last night. I was<br/>too busy prepping for the festival.')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'Oh, poor thing.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Oh, come on. You've gotta take better care<br/>of yourself!")
('Van', "I'll get her for you, don't worry.")
('Van', "And if I run into that crazy cat lady...then maybe I'll<br/>lend her a hand, too.")
('Nina', 'Heehee. Thank you, Mister Spriggan.')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'You just lie down for a bit, okay?')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "I'll bug the hotel staff and get you something warm<br/>to drink.")
('Nina', "I'm sorry, Saara... You shouldn't have to worry about<br/>me with everything else going on.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "Don't sweat it. This is just what friends do.")
('Van', "(Looks like they've got it under control.)")
('Van', "(We'd better get out there and make sure that cat<br/>doesn't get her whiskers snipped.)")
('Van', "Oh, didn't expect to run into you here.<br/>Something up?")
('Dingo', "Just wanted to check out a few things before this<br/>interview I've got in Messeldam.")
('Van', "Messeldam, huh? Sucks, what's goin' on over there.<br/>Just hearin' the name makes me think of those guys.")
('Dingo', 'Yeah. Shame, too. That place is real beautiful, has a<br/>great view out over the Northern Sea.')
('Dingo', "Though last I heard, they've already moved their<br/>operations further inland.")
('Dingo', "The police and the guild are all over them, so they're<br/>lying low for the time being.")
('Dingo', "I suspect they'll be back at it soon enough.")
('Van', 'Tch. Figures. And here I thought I could finally relax<br/>for a bit.')
('Van', "Well, you catch wind of anything on your end, I'd<br/>appreciate it if you kicked it over my way.")
('Dingo', 'You got it.')
('Dingo', "Y'know, credit where it's due, Marielle put out a<br/>pretty decent piece on Tharbad.")
('Dingo', "She's been running around all over the place lately,<br/>but I guess there's a method to her madness.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "I don't know if I'll be able to help out with the plan,<br/>but I can at least get you some intel. Leave it to me!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Just you watch, Dingo... I'm gonna record Almata's<br/>last stand and write the article of a lifetime!<br/>This one's for you!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Right now, my plan is to keep interviewing evacuees<br/>and track how things are going in the other districts.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "I'm gonna need some better transportation to bust out<br/>of Seiden, but I'll figure something out!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "I can't let anything get between me and the truth.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "That's what separates the good journalists from<br/>the greats. They stop at nothing to find the truth, and<br/>neither will I!")
('Van', 'Good to see you pumped about it.')
('Feri', 'But please be careful out there! You can be a little, uh,<br/>scatterbrained sometimes.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "I-I'll be fine, thank you! See, I got this amulet<br/>from Fan. It wards off evil for me!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "It's right...here? Uhh... Oh, no, where did I put it?")
('Van', "...So as I was sayin', watch your back out there. I got<br/>enough on my plate as is.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "I just... I can't stomach writing an article about this.<br/>It's too much...")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'But I want to at least keep a good record of it...<br/>for him. That means keeping tabs on you guys, too.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "We gotta make sure we stay safe. Wouldn't want to<br/>make Dingo worry... He's watching out for us,<br/>I'm sure!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Nina's not the only one. All of the evacuees are<br/>exhausted, physically and mentally...")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "I'll have to try and help however I can.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'You guys stay safe!')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "I've come to realize how much everyone has been<br/>supporting me, and how narrow my focus has been.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Aww, man. What am I doing getting all teary-eyed at<br/>the festival? C-C'mon, haha... I should be<br/>enjoying myself!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Judith even came over to cheer me up. Right, no<br/>crying for me! Gotta turn this frown upside down!')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Reporters live for moments like these!')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "To think, after everything in Oración, we bump into<br/>each other again... Fate, surely! Now's my chance to<br/>repay you for all your help!")
('Reporter Ferdinand', "...Uh, how? All I did was run away. And really, I'm<br/>not good at these joint interviews. Can we just—")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Oh, no, no. I just want to tag along as a fellow<br/>reporter, y'know?")
('Reporter Ferdinand', "Okay, fine. But we're just walking together, that's it!<br/>We're not WORKING together, we're WALKING,<br/>got it?!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Fine by me! A real reporter doesn't rely on other<br/>people for scoops!")
('Reporter Ferdinand', "...You drive a hard bargain. Can't help but just follow<br/>you and pitch in, feels like.")
('Reporter Ferdinand', 'I mean, you give a big impassioned speech like that<br/>and I just feel inadequate, damn it! Now I HAVE to<br/>put my back into it!')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Heehee! Thanks for the help, Ferdinand!')
('Prince Sherid', 'Well, now. Who could have imagined those jewels I<br/>brought along would come in handy?')
('Prince Sherid', 'With those demon spheres cleared out, Naje and I<br/>should be able to hold this area.')
('Prince Sherid', 'Now, go. The city needs you elsewhere. I trust<br/>Arkride Solutions to make good on that request!')
('Prince Sherid', 'I say, this makes my whole trip worth it, right here.<br/>What more could a man want?')
('Prince Sherid', 'These stalls are simply overflowing with wonderful<br/>food and drink!')
('Prince Sherid', 'Quite the pleasant change of pace, I must admit—<br/>Naje simply has to be a stick in the mud and forbid<br/>me from snacking at the hotel.')
('Prince Sherid', 'But today, I am FREE! Oh, the joys of juicy grilled<br/>chicken! The refreshing note of cold brew!')
('Naje', 'Incidentally, his highness is standing by at the hotel.')
('Naje', "This incident is quickly spreading beyond<br/>Calvard's borders... We dawdle too long, and we may<br/>be unable to contain it.")
('Naje', "We'll do what we can on our end. Godspeed, all<br/>of you.")
('Naje', 'To think this is the work of a single organization...<br/>It stands to reason that they have backers in<br/>high places.')
('Naje', "At any rate, we'll continue our reconnaissance and<br/>report our findings to you. Please, stay safe.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'I swear, I take my eyes off Shaheena for one second,<br/>and she just blossoms into a responsible young lady.')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "At this rate, she's going to eclipse my big sister<br/>energy—and I can't have that! I have to do what I can<br/>to lift everybody's spirits!")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "Even the evacuees are getting back on their feet.<br/>That's good!")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "I'll try and help out the hotel staff however I can.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "I don't know the specifics about what's going on, but<br/>I trust Shaheena and all of you to take care of it. I just<br/>gotta do what I can!")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "Come back safely, okay? I'd hate for you to get hurt<br/>out there!")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'Shaheena said she was gonna meet up with some<br/>friends of hers over at the bathhouse.')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "It's really nice to see her making new friends.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "And everyone has been so kind to me as well. I really<br/>feel like I've made some lifelong friends, heehee.")
('Shaheena', 'Wow! Bet you could haul all kinds of stuff with a car<br/>that big!')
('Shaheena', 'Oh, looks like the whole Arkride gang is here.')
('Shaheena', "Make sure you come back okay! We'll be waiting<br/>for you!")
('Shaheena', "*sniffle* Thank the Goddess you're safe!")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'You, too, Shaheena. You, too... You really stepped<br/>up today.')
('Van', "Good, the sisters are back together. That's one less<br/>thing to worry about.")
('Shaheena', 'Yeah, I ran into this racer guy, and he gave me a lift<br/>in his car!')
('Shaheena', 'And that chief guy came along, too, so we all made it<br/>out okay!')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'Sorry for worrying you guys.')
('Feri', "It's okay! We're just happy you two found each other.")
('Feri', "But what's with the limo and all these boxes, out<br/>of curiosity?")
('Naje', 'The boxes are full of supplies we procured from the<br/>police station.')
('Naje', "And with His Highness' limousine, we'll be delivering<br/>these supplies to areas that need them.")
('Agnès', "Ah, that's a good idea. Best of luck!")
('Quatre', 'Most vehicles have been halted out on the roads, but<br/>a few are still moving... The common link being that<br/>they all relate to Van.')
('Shaheena', "Yeeeah, haha, all that stuff's kinda over my head.<br/>But we'll still pitch in!")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "Yeah. Now's our chance to pay everyone back for all<br/>their help!")
('Van', "Thanks much. I'll leave that to you.")
('Naje', 'Indeed. I wish you the best of luck.')
('Inspector Daswani', "So you guys ended up here, too... I'm aware there's a<br/>plan to break through this mess.")
('Inspector Daswani', "We're down on manpower 'cause of this whole<br/>'freezing' thing, but we'll do what we can to help.")
('Van', "Yeah, we're heading out for Vantail in a bit.<br/>We'll leave the inner city to you.")
('Van', "Actually, you been to Old Town? We don't have the<br/>time to check ourselves. Everything okay over there?")
('Inspector Daswani', 'Yeah, that lady running the tobacco kiosk is rounding<br/>everybody up. All things considered, they should<br/>be fine.')
('Inspector Daswani', "I couldn't stay, though. Man of the law. This is my<br/>responsibility now.")
('Inspector Daswani', "My family's taking shelter over at Montmart...and I'm<br/>out here trying to figure out this mess.")
('Van', 'Yeah, that tracks. Old Town folks are tough as nails.')
('Van', "That old lady knows what she's doin'. They'll be<br/>all right.")
('Inspector Daswani', 'Yeah. And I called some officers out there for<br/>backup, just to make sure.')
('Inspector Daswani', "I'm planning to gather up some officers and sweep<br/>around town for...")
('Inspector Daswani', '...Hmph. I can just hear her chewing me out for<br/>putting my job first again.')
('Inspector Daswani', "Old Town is as safe as we can reasonably get it, so<br/>I'm gonna head out to the other districts and get<br/>them under control.")
('Inspector Daswani', '*sigh* Here I am, leaving my family behind to go out<br/>on the job. Again. How am I gonna make it up to<br/>them once this is all over...?')
('Inspector Daswani', "Longlai? I heard things can get a little sketchy there,<br/>being a border town and all, but it's supposed to be<br/>pretty safe otherwise.")
('Inspector Daswani', "Don't you cause any trouble there.")
('Inspector Daswani', 'Seems like wherever you go, Gehenna seems<br/>to follow. Hopefully this time you keep your nose<br/>outta trouble.')
('Inspector Daswani', "Longlai? I heard things can get a little sketchy there,<br/>being a border town and all, but it's supposed to be<br/>pretty safe otherwise.")
('Inspector Daswani', "Don't you cause any trouble there.")
('Inspector Daswani', 'Seems like wherever you go, Gehenna seems<br/>to follow. Hopefully this time you keep your nose<br/>outta trouble.')
('Inspector Daswani', "On the subject of trouble, we're sending some officers<br/>to Tharbad in case anything funny happens at the<br/>Film Festival.")
('Inspector Daswani', 'Had this source tip us off that something might be<br/>brewing over there...')
('Inspector Daswani', "It may very well be just a rumor, but I got a hunch<br/>it's not. We might need you for backup if things<br/>go south.")
('Inspector Daswani', "I can't give any details beyond that, but just be ready<br/>for anything.")
(15100, 'Yes, sir!')
('Detective Nate', "So you're here, too. I heard from Inspector Daswani<br/>that you're involved with this plan going forward.")
('Detective Nate', "Never thought I'd work with a spriggan on this, but<br/>desperate times and all. We're counting on you.")
('Detective Nate', "I'll do what I can here to help the inspector out.")
('Detective Nate', "We've got Tyrell locked down with the help of the<br/>guild, so I headed out here to try and get this area<br/>under control.")
('Detective Nate', "I had to leave my girlfriend for this...again. I really<br/>can't keep doing that... I gotta treat her right from<br/>now on.")
('Detective Nate', "Once this is all done, I'm gonna try to make it up to<br/>her one more... No, I won't TRY. I WILL!")
('Detective Nate', "Oookay. Gonna take that day off, and then we'll have<br/>a nice little dinner date and a hotel stay for the night!")
('Detective Nate', "Heh, don't worry. I've got the mira. May not look it,<br/>but I'm pretty well off as an investigator.")
("Nate's Girlfriend", "Okay, I think I can get that day off. No way I'm<br/>turning you down this time.")
("Nate's Girlfriend", "It's a date, then. Just make sure it's a good one,<br/>won't you?")
('Detective Nate', 'So, what do you think of the Tharbad Film Festival?<br/>Would you be interested in going at all, just the two<br/>of us?')
("Nate's Girlfriend", 'Hmm... Well, it does sound kinda fun.')
("Nate's Girlfriend", "But it's only been two weeks since we really got to<br/>know each other. For a first date, that seems a little,<br/>uh...much?")
("Nate's Girlfriend", 'It just feels a little fast to me, I guess.')
('Detective Nate', "I get that, yeah, but time off is few and far between.<br/>I gotta seize the day, y'know?")
('Detective Nate', 'And then I thought: what better way to spend my day<br/>off than with you?')
("Nate's Girlfriend", 'Ehh... Like, I see your point.')
("Nate's Girlfriend", "But I'd better not see you drooling over the dancers<br/>while we're there, got it?")
('Detective Nate', "Well, of course! I'll have a hard enough time keeping<br/>my eyes off of YOU, honey.")
('Kilika', "Everyone needs to relieve stress every now and then—<br/>that's exactly what these places are for.")
('Kilika', "Why not have a seat? I'll take care of the bill for you.")
('Van', "(Freakin' suits tryin' to butter me up with free shit.<br/>René pulls this all the time, too!)")
('Kilika', "We'll be entrusting Almata's artifacts to the church...<br/>and the 'leftovers' will fall under Heiyue's jurisdiction.")
('Kilika', 'The CID and the guild should make quick work of<br/>what stragglers remain.')
('Kilika', "Melchior is still a concern, being one of their most<br/>prominent leaders, but we haven't noticed any moves<br/>from him as of late.")
('Kilika', "Not that we should write them off just yet.<br/>We'll need to stay vigilant.")
('Fan', "I don't know if Cao's going to be able to make the<br/>capture, but either way, we should gather up some<br/>troops and head that way.")
('Fan', "Here's hoping you can meet up with the people you're<br/>looking for there, too, Aaron and Mr. Arkride.")
('Aaron', "That's the plan. Don't throw your back out, all right?")
('Fan', "The fiends out there aren't trying to get inside any<br/>buildings, from the looks of it. Perhaps they're...<br/>forbidden, somehow.")
('Fan', "At any rate, you can leave the hotel to us. I'm a touch<br/>rusty, but I still remember my arts.")
('Fan', 'Take care of yourself out there, Aaron.')
('Aaron', 'Heh. Speak for yourself.')
('Fan', "Haha... I imagine I'll have some interesting<br/>conversations with the former president and<br/>the crown prince.")
('Fan', "They're both quite unconventional fellows...<br/>Ones you don't often get to talk with.<br/>Those connections must be handled with care.")
('Fan', "I'm impressed you tracked down this little meeting of<br/>ours, Mr. Arkride. As I'd heard, you've a keen eye<br/>and a sharper nose.")
('Fan', 'At any rate, Ashen should be here for the festival.<br/>It would be nice if you could show her a good time.')
('Feri', "Yeah! It's been two months already... I can't wait to<br/>see her again!")
('Aaron', "Yeah, I don't mind. Long as she keeps her opinions<br/>to herself.")
('Van', 'Said the pot to the kettle.')
('Fan', 'The storm has subsided for the moment...but we can<br/>hardly tell when it may return.')
('Fan', "I wish I had a better grasp of the situation, but alas, I<br/>cannot redraw my cards. We will play with the hands<br/>we're dealt.")
('Fan', "I'll be assisting myself, in Heiyue's name.")
('Naje', 'You can leave the hotel perimeter to me. I should be<br/>able to handle these beasts myself.')
('Van', "Sounds good. We're countin' on you.")
('Prince Sherid', "Shock and awe...but we've no time to dawdle.<br/>We need to intercept these villains and put an end to<br/>their plans.")
('Prince Sherid', 'And then, once this mess is over, we can all get back<br/>to our regularly-scheduled festival cheer.')

('Van', "I'm all for wrappin' this up ASAP, and you should<br/>be, too. Y'know, for uhh...peace. And shit.")
('Prince Sherid', "Indeed. Arkride Solutions, don't fail me now!")
('Cao', 'Incidentally, the clamor in Langport has subsided for<br/>the time being.')
('Cao', 'I heard your comrades may have been mixed up in all<br/>the chaos, there.')
('Cao', 'But I must say, those young men do inspire<br/>confidence in me. The future is in good hands with<br/>their types at the helm.')
('Aaron', "Syd and the boys, huh? Good to hear they're doing<br/>all right.")
('Aaron', "Might as well kick back with them if they're coming<br/>on down for the festival.")

('Van', "Yeah, yeah. Was figurin' that anyway.")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "We'll need to be ready for anything—if anything<br/>unexpected crops up, we have to respond at a<br/>moment's notice.")

('Warrant Officer Cody', '...No, no. I have to trust her. I have my own job to<br/>do, so I gotta stay in my lane!')
('Warrant Officer Cody', "Don't you let up either. We can't let all our effort go<br/>to waste because of one weak link!")
('Van', "Well, look at you, out here doin' security for<br/>the bigwigs. Looks like they're keepin' you busy.")
('Warrant Officer Cody', "Ha, yeah. I was NOT expecting I'd get assigned to a<br/>post like this.")
('Warrant Officer Cody', 'I mean, I get it, the president needs security for all his<br/>visits, just...me?')
('Warrant Officer Cody', "Bleh, no, bad thoughts. Just gotta shut up and do<br/>my job! Don't need any pity or pep talks for that!")
('Van', 'Yep. Keep your chin up, bud.')
('Van', "(If I remember right, he's Kaela's brother. Seems like<br/>they both have their hands full with bureaucracy and<br/>all that kinda crap.)")

('Warrant Officer Cody', "That said, I'm not sure if he picked it out today<br/>because he expected more casual company, or what.")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "At any rate, I'm glad you and the president are safe.")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "This brought back ugly memories of the war...<br/>I couldn't help but worry about you.")
('Warrant Officer Cody', "You can't help but worry about everything, heh.<br/>But yeah, I'm glad you're all right, too.")
('Van', 'Good to see you two safe and sound. Guess siblings<br/>got a way of finding each other, huh?')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "Ah! You're here, too. Good work dealing with the<br/>demon sphere.")
('Warrant Officer Cody', 'Keeping the CID informed is part of my duty, right<br/>alongside security detail for the president.')

('Aaron', '...All right? Dunno what he has to do with all this,<br/>but sure.')
('Van', "He's probably tryna smooth things over with, y'know,<br/>the rest of the continent.")
('Van', "And I figure he's keepin' my connection to it on the<br/>downlow, so they don't get suspicious.")
('Agnès', 'Yeah, that makes sense. Tensions are running high<br/>right now... He needs to try and keep everyone calm.')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "Indeed, restoring order is in Calvard's best interests.")

(15101, 'Or any comment on your own scandal as of late?<br/>Could you tell us your side of the story?')

('Van', 'Yeah—after this troublemaker showed up.')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "I'll be taking my leave now, sir.")

('Van', "Nah. He's just an old acquaintance I can't seem<br/>to shake.")
('Van', "Anyway, much as I hate being in his debt over<br/>anything, this'll be over way faster with him on<br/>the case.")

('Agnès', 'I see...')
('Agnès', '...')
('Van', "If you wanna call this whole thing off, I'm fine<br/>with that.")
('Van', "Won't charge you anything if you do—not after how<br/>much of a mess this has turned into.")
('Van', 'Leaving this all to me also works if you trust<br/>me enough.')
('Agnès', "That's not an issue, but...")
('Agnès', "Now that someone's lost their life, I don't think I can<br/>afford to avert my eyes. It's not right.")
('Agnès', 'Can I not stay with you for at least today?')
('Agnès', 'It pains me to cause you more problems than I already<br/>have, but at the same time...')
('Van', "Heh. You're too young to worry about causing your<br/>elders problems.")
('Van', "All right. If you're that set on this, then let's get back<br/>to work.")
('Van', 'Next up, we take the subway to Riverside.')
('Agnès', "What? You aren't thinking of going back to the scene<br/>of the crime, are you?")
('Van', "Nah. Still gonna be sealed off, so no way we're<br/>getting close to it. I've got somewhere else in mind.")

('Agnès', 'W-Wait! The key witnesses here are—')
('Dingo', 'Having a rough day?')
('Van', "Ehh, nothin' I'm not used to. I'm gonna go see<br/>Bermotti now.")
('Van', 'That should square us out after I lent a hand on that<br/>case with the spoiled brat.')
('Dingo', "Heh. Sure. I'll get it done.")
('Agnès', "*sigh* That wasn't very nice of you, Van.")
('Agnès', "You can't just feed someone in her position<br/>false information.")
('Van', "Sure I can. Last thing we need when we're busy is a<br/>reckless rookie sticking her nose into our shit.")
('Van', 'Why not let her make trouble for the cops to make<br/>our job easier?')
('Agnès', '...')
('Agnès', 'W-Wait for me!')
('Van', "This is the Seiden District. Our target's in the<br/>waterways underneath here.")
('Feri', 'Whoa... The air here is so different from the<br/>other districts.')
('Feri', "It's very...business-y.")
('Agnès', 'Well, a lot of government bodies and big companies<br/>work out of here.')
('Agnès', "There's a large police station over there that no doubt<br/>contributes, too.")
('Agnès', 'The hotel over to our left is really famous and<br/>regularly hosts important visitors from abroad.')
('Feri', 'How interesting... You sure know a lot about this<br/>area, Agnès!')
('Agnès', "Well, I do live here. I'd say it's natural to know a lot<br/>about the city you live in.")
('Van', '...')
('Agnès', 'Umm... So where are we supposed to enter the<br/>underground waterway?')
('Van', 'The entrance should be under that bridge over there.')
('Van', "It's past three, so it's getting late. That, and we<br/>weren't exactly plannin' to look around this area...")
('Van', "...so let's just head straight over.")
('Van', 'Here we are.')
('Agnès', 'This does look like the spot.')
('Feri', "So we're busting the door down since it's locked?")
('Van', 'Uhh... No. Put that away.')
('Van', "We've been given the code to open it. I think I input<br/>it here?")
('Van', "Okay—c'mon.")
('Detective Nate', "Okay, you've made it clear that you were there on a<br/>job given to you by the CID.")

('Detective Nate', "Of COURSE you can't!")
('Detective Nate', "How do we know that working for the CID wasn't<br/>just a cover story and you were secretly working<br/>with Grimcat?!")
('Van', "Oh, c'mon. It's a cop's job to prove we're guilty, not<br/>ours to prove we're innocent.")
('Van', 'You guys sure suck at this. Maybe you should think<br/>about a career change.')
('Detective Nate', 'S-Say that again!')
('Van', "So, what? She steal somethin' from a<br/>government building?")
('Van', "After she told you she was coming, too. But man, you<br/>STILL couldn't stop her.")
('Detective Nate', 'Grr...')
('Van', "I mean, can't say I don't feel bad for you, gettin'<br/>screwed over like that.")

('Van', "But it's not like I told 'em to come with me—I was<br/>just respecting their decisions.")
('Van', "As for the weapon, did you want us to take care of a<br/>tough CID request with our bare hands or somethin'?")
('Van', 'I tell ya, is this any way to treat people who worked<br/>for the good of their country?')
('Inspector Daswani', "If you were thinking of your country, you'd be a little<br/>more cooperative with its law enforcement!")
('Inspector Daswani', "Yet you never share more information than necessary,<br/>wield deadly weapons of unknown origin, and now<br/>you're training children in combat!")

('Feri', "Aww! You're so kind!")
(40451, "No one's going to be suffering anything! The press<br/>would have a field day!")
(40451, "And you really shouldn't put yourselves in danger like<br/>that again—especially with shady men like that one.")
(40451, "I'm saying this for your own good—")
(40451, "Yes, I'm actually questioning them right now...")
(40451, '...What?!')
('Detective Nate', "Umm... You're serious?")
('Van', "(What's up with that reaction? It's clearly not René<br/>this time.)")
('Inspector Daswani', 'I thought that was going to be the CID again, not...')
('Inspector Daswani', 'Just who is that girl?')
('Inspector Daswani', 'Oh, whatever. Just get out of here!')
('Van', "You ain't gotta tell me twice.")
('Van', 'See ya!')
('Van', "Man, that was a headache I didn't need. This is all<br/>that kinkster's fault.")
('Feri', 'I always knew I might find myself facing off against<br/>police one day...')

('Agnès', "I-I'm fine! I'm part of this operation now, too!")
('Feri', 'Umm... Do you want me to teach you how to<br/>withstand torture in case you ever need it?')
('Agnès', "I-I'm certain I'm not going to need that...")
('Agnès', '...Or so I hope.')
('Feri', '...Hmm? Anyway, why were we just allowed to go<br/>like that?')
('Van', "Was wonderin' the same thing.")
('Agnès', 'S-So was I...')
('Agnès', "(Surely they aren't on to me...?)")
('Van', '...')
('Van', "...Anyway, that marks the end of the day's training.<br/>Good job, both of you.")
('Van', 'How about we go celebrate?')
('Agnès', 'Oh!')
('Feri', 'Where are we going?')
('Van', "To the movie theater we walked past earlier. It's<br/>on me.")
('Feri', 'Really?! Yaaay!')
('Van', "There's one movie I've had my eye on for a while,<br/>so this is as good a chance as any to check it out.")
('Van', "And just so we're clear, I'm not bein' baited by<br/>the churros. Okay?")
('Agnès', "Heehee. Oh, I'm sure. Then shall we get going?")
('Feri', "I can't wait!")
('Maxim', 'I have to admit, I never thought you would be the one<br/>asking to go out with me.')

(40311, "Hah. I'd like to believe I put more passion into my<br/>films than anyone, if nothing else.")
(40311, "I'm sure it's the same with you and racing. And now<br/>these two passionate souls can finally have the talk<br/>I've always wanted.")

('Judith', 'Oh, look at you, laying on the charm.')
('Judith', "So...no girlfriend? Could I take that to mean that<br/>you also don't have a wife or kids?")
('Maxim', "...?! O-Of course I don't! Haha...")
('Maxim', "Anyway, it would be a shame to just let the evening<br/>end with dinner now that we're together like this.")
('Maxim', 'What do you say to joining me for a drive on<br/>the expressway?')
('Maxim', 'As for whether that will be where the night ends...<br/>well, that will be up to us.')
('Judith', '...Oho.')
('Judith', '(He sure is used to this... He makes even<br/>cringeworthy lines like that seem totally natural.)')
('Judith', "(Eh, whatever. This is my chance to see if there's<br/>any truth to that rumor about him traveling<br/>the country.)")
('Judith', "That's fine by me. I'm looking forward to seeing how<br/>fast you can—")
('Judith', '...?!')
('Maxim', 'Wh-What was...?')
(40301, "Z1 racer Maxim Lugan! I'm a reporter with<br/>Buzzraider Magazine!")
(40301, 'Think we could steal a few minutes of your time?')
('Maxim', "B-Buzzraider?! Not the gossip rag that's even worse<br/>than Meld...")
(40301, "I'll take that as a yes! Excellent.")
(40301, "So, we know you've been everywhere from Tharbad<br/>and Langport to Messeldam and Crossbell in the<br/>past three months.")
(40301, "You're a bit of a globetrotter in your off time,<br/>wouldn't you say?")
('Maxim', 'Uhh...')
(40301, "Now, it's clear you've been living up to your single<br/>status to find yourself a girl in every town.")
(40301, "Then could it be you're on the hunt for one here in<br/>Edith now, too?")
('Maxim', 'How did you...? Have you been following me<br/>EVERYWHERE I go?!')
('Maxim', "Ugh... I'll admit that I spend my nights out on the<br/>town, but that's not why I'm traveling around—")
(40301, 'HOLY CANNOLI!')
('Judith', '...')
('Maxim', "W-Wait! She's got nothing to do with—")
(40301, "I can't believe what a scoop we have on our hands.<br/>Meld's gonna be eating our dust with this one!")
(40301, 'So, how long have the two of you been dating, Ms.<br/>Judith Lanster?!')
('Inspector Daswani', "Nice to see you again. I see you've got a new recruit.")
('Inspector Daswani', 'Strange time for a new hire...though why do I feel<br/>like I know you from somewhere?')
('Judith', 'Ahaha. Oh, no worries. I get that a lot...')
('Van', "Business has been boomin' lately, is all. Enough to<br/>justify splurging for another temp.")
('Detective Nate', 'Well, you sure know how to pick the pretty ones!<br/>Hey, miss, ever wanted to go out for dinner with an<br/>officer of the law?')
('Judith', 'Umm...')
('Inspector Daswani', "You idiot. Show some class—this isn't the place or<br/>the time.")
('Detective Nate', 'S-Sorry... I was just hoping to lighten the mood<br/>before this conference.')
('Detective Nate', "The air's so heavy right now, I almost can't take it.")
('Van', 'Is the conference on what to do about A?')
('Inspector Daswani', 'Exactly that. We knew they were trouble, but I think<br/>we underestimated just how much.')
('Detective Nate', "A-Are you sure it's all right to be telling them<br/>that, sir?")
('Inspector Daswani', "If it wasn't, I wouldn't have done it. It's not as though<br/>they're uninvolved in all of this.")
('Inspector Daswani', 'We might not always see eye to eye, but I think all of<br/>us are at least united in not wanting what happened<br/>in Creil to happen ever again.')
('Detective Nate', 'Sir...')
('Van', "You're damn right there. Don't know how much we<br/>can contribute, but we'll do what we can.")
('Agnès', "I can't help but wonder why they even picked Creil as<br/>their target in the first place.")
('Agnès', 'It was such a beautiful, peaceful village full of<br/>kind people. There was nothing that made it<br/>stand out.')
('Feri', "Yeah. It's not like they had specific enemies there like<br/>Aida's unit.")
('Inspector Daswani', "There's been discussion in some circles that it might<br/>have been racially motivated, but it's just rumor at<br/>this point.")
('Judith', 'Really, now...?')
('Van', "It's not like this is the first time we've heard Almata's<br/>been funded by racist terrorists, so it's<br/>not implausible.")
('Aaron', "Now that I'm thinking about it, people do say it's got<br/>a lot of immigrants for a village up north.")
('Kilika', 'Even that could be a pretext, I fear.')
('Inspector Daswani', 'Ms. Rouran.')
('Kilika', 'Good day to you, detectives. Arkride Solutions.')
('Agnès', "You're...")
('Van', 'Here all the way from Vantail, huh?')
('Van', "Funny how you meet someone for the first time and<br/>then just happen to bump into 'em again and<br/>again, huh?")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "Yes, it's...funny.")
('Warrant Officer Cody', "I wasn't expecting to run into you again this<br/>soon, either.")
('Van', 'Are the three of you here to take part in this<br/>conference, too, then?')
('Kilika', 'That is correct. The president has ordered that the<br/>army and the police work together on quelling<br/>this crisis.')
('Kilika', 'We at the CID will be serving as a bridge between<br/>the two organizations.')
('Agnès', '...Then your goal is to lure Almata out of hiding?')
('Kilika', 'That is one goal, certainly. Our first objective is<br/>ensuring the safety of the capital—then we can begin<br/>the next phase of our operation.')
('Kilika', "According to our expert sources, the artifacts in their<br/>possession thankfully don't give them the ability to<br/>teleport over large distances.")
('Kilika', "That means it shouldn't take us that long to bolster<br/>the city's defenses.")
('Van', "Heh. I don't need two guesses on who those expert<br/>sources are.")
('Judith', 'More shady people?')
('Risette', "Marduk has reached the same conclusion. The odds<br/>of Edith being Almata's next target are low.")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "We're going to be working on more thorough<br/>measures to eradicate them, but those may take<br/>a while.")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "In the meantime, we're going to have to rely on<br/>slightly more unusual measures to keep everyone safe.")
('Van', "Which is why you decided to leak Dingo's video?")
('Feri', "I'm sure a bunch of jaegers will be in action after<br/>what's happened on behalf of clients.")
('Aaron', "And I doubt Heiyue's gonna stay quiet.")
('Risette', 'I expect the same will be true of my own employer.<br/>They will involve themselves in this in some way<br/>or another.')
('Kilika', "I wouldn't quite say we're trying to fight evil with evil,<br/>but at the very least, the army and the police may not<br/>be enough.")
('Kilika', 'So the president believes.')
('Agnès', '...')
('Detective Nate', '(Sh-Should we really be hearing all of this?)')
('Inspector Daswani', '(I understand how you feel, but keep your head down<br/>and listen. This knowledge could be useful to<br/>you someday.)')
('Van', 'So is René with the president?')
('Van', "I'm assumin' so, since he's got the fancy temp title of<br/>'presidential aide' and all.")
('Kilika', "He is. He's currently on loan to the president, serving<br/>as our point of contact in his vicinity.")
('Kilika', "I'm confident that he will do a first-rate job—though<br/>I can't help but worry about just what that entails to<br/>an ambitious man like him.")
('Van', 'Yeah, I feel you.')
('Warrant Officer Cody', 'Oh, right. I have a message from you-know-who.')
('Warrant Officer Cody', 'He says that the group sealing off the mountains to<br/>the south of Longlai is acting off.')
('Warrant Officer Cody', "And this is from me: if you're going to meddle, just<br/>be careful.")
('Van', 'Thanks for the heads up. Give him our regards, too.')
('Judith', "That's Ikaruga, right?")
('Aaron', 'Great. Not those monsters.')
('Quatre', 'The last thing we want is more trouble right now...')
(40301, "It's almost time for the conference to<br/>begin, Inspector.")
('Inspector Daswani', 'Got it. Are you ready, Ms. Rouran?')
('Kilika', "Of course. Let's be going.")
('Inspector Daswani', "I can't pretend to be a fan of the work you do...")
('Inspector Daswani', "...but I know you're trying to stop this madness as<br/>much as we are.")
('Inspector Daswani', "We're going to do the best we can in our own way—<br/>you should do the same.")
('Van', "That goes without sayin'.")
('Risette', "Pandemonium's effect seems to be even more<br/>pronounced here.")
('Feri', 'Oh! Look up there!')
('Aaron', "You kidding me? Why's it gotta be so high up?")
('Agnès', "If we can't do something about it, this miasma will<br/>only grow thicker.")
('Bergard', 'We have company!')
('Van', "Then let's take 'em down! Then we can—")
('Prince Sherid', 'Wait! Leave this to us!')
('Agnès', 'Your Highness! Naje!')
('Aaron', 'Fan! I forgot you were in this part of town!')
('Prince Sherid', 'Illume the darkness! Seven Shahms!')
('Fan', 'I shall join you—even if it has been some time since I<br/>last fought.')
('Fan', 'Begone, foul fiends...and disperse!')
('Naje', "It's over! Verethragna!")
('Feri', 'Amazing...')
('Risette', "That wasn't the last of them!")
('Bergard', "This must be the demon sphere's work.")
('Naje', "We should retreat for now! We'll only wear ourselves<br/>down trying to face them all!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'This way, you guys!')
('Nina', "You'll be safe indoors!")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "There's more than enough space for everyone in here!")
('Agnès', 'Marielle! Nina! Saara!')
('Van', 'Got it!')
('Feri', "We're on our way!")
('System', 'They hurried inside the hotel and remained vigilant<br/>while making sure that no devils were going to follow<br/>them inside.')
('System', 'They then began exchanging information with<br/>one another.')
('Van', 'So Judith went off on her own, huh?')
('Nina', "Yes, that's right. She went out saying she 'had<br/>something to take care of' after that message from the<br/>mafia earlier.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "She insisted that she had someone she could depend<br/>on so we shouldn't worry, but of course I'm going<br/>to worry.")
('Prince Sherid', "I can't help but wonder if it's that 'Grimcat' who<br/>made an appearance in Tharbad.")
('Prince Sherid', "She and Judith didn't feel like strangers to me.")
('Naje', '...Your Highness.')
('Fan', 'Hmm...')
('Aaron', "(I wouldn't put it past the prince or Fan to figure out<br/>the truth at all.)")
('Risette', "(Marduk strongly suspects that she's Grimcat as well.)")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "I've heard all kinds of rumors about how capable<br/>Grimcat is as a thief, so I could rest a little easier if<br/>she's helping Judith...")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', '...but only a little. Anyway, she seemed like she was<br/>off to investigate that sphere.')
('Feri', 'I had a feeling that was what she was out to do...<br/>Okay! Leave this to us!')
('Van', "She's the main reason we're in the area, yeah.<br/>She's one of us now—we gotta look out for her.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'I do remember her saying that you were helping her<br/>prepare for her next film or something.')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'We leave her in your capable hands, then!')
('Nina', "She was sure that you were going to come for her.<br/>She didn't doubt it for a moment.")
('Nina', "I suspect she's waiting for you even now.")
('Agnès', 'Judith...')
('Van', "Got it. Thanks for tellin' us all this.")
('Prince Sherid', "Still, we've been led to believe that the power of this<br/>demon sphere is quite formidable.")
('Prince Sherid', "I don't know how much we'll be able to help you, but<br/>we would like to join you all the same.")
('Van', "You sure? We're not gonna turn down your help if<br/>you're willin' to give it.")
('Prince Sherid', 'I most certainly am. I was planning to head out<br/>myself to investigate if Judith had not spoken up first.')
('Naje', "I wasn't able to do anything to help you near<br/>Central Station, but His Highness and I will give you<br/>our full support now.")
('Fan', 'In that case, you can leave protecting this hotel to me.')
('Aaron', 'Sounds good. You and your curses should be plenty to<br/>keep this place secure.')
('Risette', 'Then we will accept your most gracious of offers.')
('Bergard', "Now that we've settled this matter, we should be on<br/>the move.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Just please, all of you—be careful.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "That includes you, Van! Don't ever let what Dingo<br/>said leave your mind!")
('Van', "Wouldn't dream of it.")
('System', 'Crown Prince Sherid and Naje have temporarily<br/>joined the party as guests.')
('Feri', "I can sense people inside. I'm going in first!")
('Van', 'Got it. Just be care—')
('Van', 'No, get back!')
('Feri', 'Ack!')
('Agnès', 'Feri! Van!')
('Feri', "I-I'm fine! Forget about me!")
('Aaron', "That doesn't look like it's gonna be easy to break.")
('Risette', "It's an extremely potent barrier made up of tens<br/>of layers!")
('Prince Sherid', 'Seven stones from the sea of stars, become<br/>my strength!')
('Naje', 'Your Highness!')
('Van', 'The jewel arts of the Asval family!')
('Prince Sherid', "Ugh... My power alone isn't going to be enough!")
('Van', 'Bah!')
('Bergard', 'Mmgh... If only we could break through here...!')
('Ashladd', 'Then allow me to grant you my aid.')
('Agnès', 'Oh!')
('Bergard', 'Ashladd!')
('Prince Sherid', 'The Thaumaturgy of the church!')
('Prince Sherid', "You'll only have a moment to get inside once<br/>it breaks! Naje, go with them!")
('Naje', '...If that is your wish, Your Highness!')
('Van', "It's gonna break! NOW!")
('Judith', 'Yes! There you are!')
('Maxim', 'Am I ever happy to see you, spriggan!')
('Agnès', 'Judith! Maxim!')
('Van', "I'm not seein' Yumé and Paulette here, but that just<br/>means we don't gotta be gentle!")
('Van', 'Can you two take care of this?')
('Aaron', 'No problem!')
('Risette', 'Understood!')
('Maxim', 'Whoooa!')
('Judith', 'Phew! Nice work!')
('Bergard', 'Now the real battle begins!')
('Naje', "I won't fail the crown prince after he helped forge a<br/>path for us!")
('Van', "We're countin' on you, bodyguard! ...How about you?<br/>What're you gonna do?")
('Judith', "It's payback time after I let myself get captured<br/>without a fight, of course!")
('Maxim', "E-Everything's back to normal...")
('Judith', "*pant* That's what you get...for messing with ME!")
('Judith', 'But what took you so long?! We were waiting<br/>for ages!')
('Feri', 'Heehee. Sorry about that.')
('Agnès', "All's well that ends well, though.")
('Van', "Sounds like you believed in your heart of hearts that<br/>we'd come for you. Heh. That's kinda sweet.")
('Judith', "Don't try and get cute with me. I just have a duty<br/>as Grimcat to—ah.")
('Naje', 'I heard nothing.')
('Maxim', 'Erm... I feel like I just heard<br/>something mindblowing...')
('Maxim', "...but my brain's kind of fried right now, so I'm just<br/>gonna...forget it.")
('Judith', 'I...appreciate that.')
('Aaron', "It's like the worst kept secret in the world at<br/>this point.")
('Prince Sherid', 'I see everything worked out.')
('Naje', "I'm glad you're all right, Your Highness. And you<br/>were from the church, I believe?")
('Bergard', 'He is part of the Papal Guard. It is reassuring that<br/>you are also working to quell this crisis.')
('Ashladd', 'Indeed—though I regret that I am alone. All of my<br/>subordinates are frozen in place.')
('Van', 'Hmm... Makes sense.')
('Van', "We're acquainted with you, but we haven't said a<br/>word to any of your people.")
('Agnès', 'Van...')
('Judith', 'Huh? Wh-What? Am I missing something?')
('Ashladd', 'So this is connected to you in some manner. I<br/>did wonder.')
('Prince Sherid', "Speak. We don't have much time, but this sounds like<br/>something we should at least hear a brief summary of<br/>before heading off.")
('System', 'They shared their theory with those present in case<br/>any of them had evidence that would support or<br/>discredit it.')
('Judith', "I can't believe it... So right now everyone moving is<br/>someone connected to you in some way?")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'I-Is that even possible?')
('Fan', 'Hmm... The vast majority of my men are also frozen,<br/>but now that I think about it...')
('Fan', '...the only exceptions are the ones who acted as guides<br/>for you in Langport.')
('Prince Sherid', "It's the same for my people. Only those who<br/>interacted with him are still moving.")
('Prince Sherid', "I don't know what exactly this means, but I suspect<br/>investigating and resolving the matter is your cross<br/>to bear.")
('Feri', 'Y-Your Highness...')
('Van', "Yes, Your Highness. I'm painfully aware of that.")
('Van', 'I gotta clean up my own mess—and trust me, I will.')
('Agnès', "If I may, Your Highness, that's not true.")
('Agnès', "This isn't just Van's cross to bear—we will all bear it<br/>with him.")
('Van', '...!')
('Risette', "She's right. We've all confronted Almata in the past.")
('Aaron', "Yeah. We don't plan on letting him pull his 'I gotta<br/>do this alone!' BS this time around.")
('Bergard', 'You still clearly have a lot to learn, young one.')
('Van', "Should've known...")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'What a great team...')
('Prince Sherid', 'Heh. Fair enough—I see that I was mistaken.')
('Nina', '...')
('Judith', "Well, I still need you guys to prepare for my next role,<br/>which means that I'll be sticking around until<br/>I'm satisfied.")
('Judith', "So let's take these jerks DOWN! Who knows?<br/>Maybe the experience'll come in handy if they ever<br/>ask me to play Grimcat!")
('Feri', "(I don't think she cares how silly her story sounds as<br/>long as she can justify coming with us.)")
('Agnès', "(Ahaha...)<br/>Still, we're very happy to have you!")
('Van', 'Yeah. Now we just have to find Quatre, and the<br/>Arkride Solutions gang is all back together.')
('Van', "So let's get on over to the Auber District.")
('Aaron', "Yeah. The countdown's still going, so we don't<br/>have—")
('Aaron', 'Not again!')
('Risette', "This isn't Ms. Bright...")
('Melchior', "Hello again! It's time for another update.")
('Melchior', 'The demon spheres in the 2nd, 9th, and 10th districts<br/>have all been destroyed.')
('Melchior', 'Now you have three hours and fifty<br/>minutes remaining. Better get to it, now!')
('Judith', 'He still gets my goat, but he sure seemed less talkative<br/>than he did back in Oración.')
('Agnès', "I'm not surprised, either—everyone on our side has<br/>been working so hard to stop them.")
('Van', "Yeah. If we exclude Vantail for now, there's only<br/>three districts left to handle, like Auber.")
('Maxim', "You're heading back out there now, then?")
('Van', "Yeah. Leave Paulette and Yumé to us—we'll bring<br/>'em back safe and sound.")
('Feri', "You said you were separated from them when you<br/>were escaping Vantail, didn't you?")
('Maxim', "Yeah. I'm planning to head back out and check a few<br/>routes out of it where they could be myself.")
('Maxim', "I'll leave Auber to you. If you do find them, then<br/>please help them!")
('Van', "That goes without sayin'. I've known 'em both way<br/>longer than you have, y'know.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Please be careful, you guys!')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "I'm going to keep doing all I can as a reporter—and<br/>cover for what Dingo would've done too while I'm<br/>at it!")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'I plan to help out whenever and wherever I can, too.<br/>Just like my sister.')
('Nina', 'Come back safe, Judith.')
('Nina', 'And if she tries to do anything silly, give her a good<br/>telling off for me, everyone.')
('Judith', "D-Don't act like you're my mother!")
('Ashladd', '...')
('System', "Iscariot's taciturn vice captain departed shortly after,<br/>saying he had another mission to take care of.")
('System', 'Van and friends also departed the area, leaving<br/>everyone to return to action in their own ways.')
('System', 'Judith rejoined the party.')
('System', "To advance the main story, select 'Auber District' or<br/>choose it from the Travel menu instead.")
('Van', 'Oh, is that...?')
('Van', "Well, look what we have here: an inspector and a<br/>bracer shootin' the shit over drinks.")
('Van', "Man, if even you two can be friends, the capital's in<br/>good hands.")
('Inspector Daswani', "I wouldn't exactly call us 'friends.'")
('Inspector Daswani', "The guild's not the CID, but they're far from<br/>our allies. At best, we're rivals.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'But given how much our work overlaps, we often see<br/>each other out in the field. We respect each other as<br/>fellow public servants.')
('Zin the Immovable', 'So rivals we may be, but we can still share a drink or<br/>two, eh?')
('Zin the Immovable', 'You care to join us?')
('Van', "Nah, I'm good. Gonna stretch my legs a bit more.")
('Zin the Immovable', "Heh, fair enough. Drinking with old dogs like us isn't<br/>the most attractive offer, I guess.")
('Zin the Immovable', "But y'know, I'm sure Elaine wouldn't mind having a<br/>drinking buddy after work.")
('Van', "...I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that.")
('Inspector Daswani', 'That reminds me. I heard you pitched in during that<br/>mess in Basel?')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Yeah, I heard from Alvis. Sounds like you made<br/>yourself pretty busy over there.')
('Van', "Wasn't what I was there for, but yeah, I helped out<br/>where I could.")
('Inspector Daswani', "How about next time you let us know where you're<br/>headed beforehand? That way we can clean up these<br/>messes you inevitably get into.")
('Van', "Yes, because I'm totally the one causing 'em all.<br/>Riiight.")
('Van', "But in case you'd like to know, most of next week'll<br/>be Arkride-free here in Edith.")
('Van', "Me and the gang're takin' a little vacation.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Hey, not a bad idea—I bet you could use the break.<br/>Where are you headed?')
('Van', "Figured it'd be nice to get away from the hustle and<br/>bustle for a while, so we're headed out to Longlai for<br/>a little hot spring trip.")
('Inspector Daswani', 'Longlai, huh? My wife and I went there for<br/>our honeymoon.')
('Inspector Daswani', "Beautiful place. I'd love to take my daughter there<br/>someday...if I could ever get time off.")
('Van', 'Aww, worked to the bone, huh?')
('Inspector Daswani', 'Yup. And whose fault is that, do you think?')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Hah! Well, you picked a good time to go there.<br/>The autumn leaves are just stunning in Longlai.')
('Zin the Immovable', "Since you'll be down that way, say hi to everybody for<br/>me, will ya?")
('Van', "Oh, yeah. You're from around there, aren't you?")
('Van', "...Wait, okay, could you not go guessin' at<br/>my background?")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Hah! Sorry, sorry. Just, your fighting form was<br/>enough of a tell.')
('Zin the Immovable', "And hey, a personal favor, if you don't mind: I'd<br/>appreciate it if you burned some incense for my old<br/>master while you're there.")
('Van', 'Sure, sure.<br/>(Tch. Read me like a book.)')
('Maxim', "Taking a trip, huh? Man, I'd love to take one with the<br/>girls myself.")
('Van', '...')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Oh, back in the land of the living, are you?')
('Inspector Daswani', "Last we saw, you'd plastered yourself to sleep.")
('Inspector Daswani', "I figured I'd just drop you off at the precinct, but<br/>I, uh... Pfft, heh. I couldn't stop laughing at your<br/>face, man.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Hah! You two in cahoots, perhaps?')
('Van', "No comment. Don't go lumping us together.")
('Maxim', 'Ouch! Why you gotta gimme the cold shoulder, man?')
('Van', '...')
('Maxim', 'A little trip really does sound nice...')
('Van', "Okay, so...go take one. Y'know, yourself.")
('Maxim', "Well, no! What's the point in taking a trip alone?<br/>It's the perfect chance to kindle the flames<br/>of romance! You know, right?")
('Van', 'How should I know?!')
('Van', "And you're really gonna push your luck and butter<br/>'em up with some trip? She didn't just magically<br/>forget what happened.")
('Maxim', "I... Look, we're moving on from that, okay?")
('Maxim', "See, when we met up last time, she said I could 'come<br/>by again sometime,' if I wanted to!")
('Maxim', "And the kid, she said, 'You're such a weirdo, mister!<br/>Hey, can you stop by again? I wanna talk to you<br/>some more!'")
('Van', "...Yeah, of course she was nice to you, she's a<br/>freakin' waitress. Yumé's reaction said it all: you ARE<br/>a weirdo.")
('Van', "I know I took on your request, but man, get your<br/>head outta your ass. Basic courtesy ain't affection.")
('Maxim', "I know that! I'm just trying to make amends!")
('Maxim', "I mean, sure, I'd love it if they could let me back into<br/>their lives, but...")
('Maxim', "...I just, I gotta take that first step myself! I wanna<br/>make up for all that time we should've spent together!")
('Maxim', "That's my new goal in life: putting a smile on<br/>their faces!")
('Van', 'Swell.')
('Van', '...Heh. Guess that was the wake-up call he needed.')
('Van', "Guy's learned he can't just treat life like it's one<br/>big game.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Sounds like you two have had your share of<br/>run-ins before.')
('Zin the Immovable', "Oh, didn't he bring his car here? I saw it<br/>parked outside.")
('Inspector Daswani', "*sigh* Of course he did... I'll lug him over to<br/>the precinct. He can sleep it off there.")
('Aaron', "Nice little party you guys got here. Don't mind if<br/>I do.")
('Fan', "Well, if it isn't Aaron and the Arkride crew. Good to<br/>see you've kept well.")
('Van', "Huh. Never thought I'd see a bracer, a Heiyue<br/>elder, a Marduk security chief, and the CID<br/>head all banded together like this.")
('Van', "Can't deny it makes me a bit on edge, though.<br/>Types from both sides of the law tend not to<br/>mix well.")
('Kilika', "I assure you, it's much less charged than you make it<br/>out to be.")
('Kilika', "We're just exchanging information and<br/>confirming agreements. Please, pay us no mind.")
('Feri', 'Kasim...')
('Risette', 'You look busier than ever, Mr. Al-Fayed.')
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', "Oh, I haven't seen you since Oración. We were<br/>actually just talking about how to go about cleaning<br/>up that mess.")
('Agnès', 'Taking care of the Almata remnants, you mean?')
('Zin the Immovable', "Yeah. We've smoked out pretty much all the hideouts<br/>they had left.")
('Cao', "We're taking our own measures, of course—mostly<br/>concerning Almata's trade and supply routes.")
('Cao', 'The more problematic trade routes have been taken<br/>care of. Heiyue will see to the rest.')
('Van', "Bet that's just what you were hoping for.")
('Kilika', 'We did also uncover some artifacts they had been<br/>using—the church is handling those.')
('Bergard', 'Yes. Celis and Leon took care of that.')
('Judith', "Well, good to hear that's taken care of.")
('Feri', "That's one problem solved.")
('Quatre', "It's nice to have that resolved in time for the festival.")
('Aaron', 'Cool. Nice not to have that looming over the festival.')
('Fan', "In truth, that's why I'm here.")
('Fan', 'The festival has the full support of the Kowloon<br/>Group this year.')
('Fan', "That, of course, does lead to some overlap between us<br/>and Marduk. I'm here to make sure we don't step on<br/>each other's toes, so to speak.")
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', "I can't tell you much, I'm afraid—only the general<br/>approach HQ is taking.")
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', "You'll have to wait three days for more<br/>in-depth negotiations. Mr. Thorndyke will be<br/>holding a meeting to go over our itinerary.")
('Fan', "Well, then you're right, now probably isn't the<br/>best time. Can't go jumping the gun!")
('Agnès', "They're discussing all sorts of things, from the looks<br/>of it.")
('Van', "Yeah. Nothin' to do with us, though.")
('Kilika', 'On the contrary, I do have some information you<br/>might find useful.')
('Kilika', "We're still tracking down some Almata holdouts that<br/>have taken to the underground...")
('Kilika', '...along with some of the hate groups they used for<br/>their ends.')
('Van', 'Leftovers, huh?')
('Aaron', "And Melchior's still on the run, too. Can't count<br/>them out just yet.")
('Aaron', "He pools those thugs back up and we'll have Almata<br/>2 on our hands.")
('Kilika', "Indeed, he's quite the wild card. We haven't seen any<br/>movements from him as of late...")
('Kilika', "...but then, that means he hasn't been contacting said<br/>remnants, either.")
('Zin the Immovable', "The guild's working on exposing Almata's<br/>business ties. We wanna pull it all out by the roots.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Elaine and some S-ranks from HQ are in charge<br/>of that.')
('Van', "Got'cha. How's she doin', outta curiosity?")
('Zin the Immovable', "Sorry, can't say for sure.")
('Zin the Immovable', "She should be back tomorrow, though. I'm sure she'd<br/>appreciate a nice, warm welcome when she<br/>gets home!")
('Van', 'Butt out, bucko.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Oh, Van!')
('Judith', 'Already doing your rounds, huh?')
('Nina', 'Congrats on the festival going off without a hitch.')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "Yes, congratulations. It's so nice to see the whole city<br/>come together to celebrate.")
('Van', 'Hard to stop a hundred-year tradition, after all.')
('Van', 'Though this festival makes all the others look like a<br/>low-budget office party.')
('Judith', "It's still a special day for all of Calvard.")
('Judith', "There's been a ton of reporters asking me<br/>for interviews. 'What do you think of the festival?'<br/>'Any big plans for next year?' All that stuff.")
('Judith', 'I heard you got caught up in a flock of<br/>paparazzi yourself.')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'Oh, I just consider that part of the festival spirit!<br/>Heehee.')
('Agnès', 'I do see a lot of people interviewing celebrities during<br/>the festival. I suppose it makes sense.')
('Aaron', "Yeah, they gotta know everything about you.<br/>What you're gonna do, where you're gonna eat, what<br/>color panties you've got on...")
('Quatre', 'That does seem to be the standard for interviews.')
('Van', "Yeah, that tracks. They gotta know everything about<br/>your personal life, or they ain't journos.")
('Feri', "I hope they didn't bother you too much. It sounds<br/>kinda fun, though!")
('Risette', 'I see... It sounds rather flattering, actually.')
('Bergard', "I see... Hah. It's overbearing just to imagine that<br/>much attention on you.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'I just wish the reporters would chill with the really<br/>personal questions.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Nowadays, they really pick at you to try and get<br/>gossip material. Whatever happened to<br/>journalistic integrity?')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'That last guy, Goddess, he did not know how to take<br/>a hint.')
('Van', 'Huh. You handle the interviews and stuff?')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Well, it did kinda end up that way, yeah.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'I still have a lot to learn, though. My seniors at the<br/>Tyrell Times have really been helping me out.')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "Oh, don't be so hard on yourself. You've been a busy<br/>bee lately!")
('Nina', "I really owe you for helping me out with that article.<br/>It was about to blow up, wasn't it, Judith?")
('Judith', 'Yup. First thing in the morning. I swear, those<br/>Buzzraider guys never learn.')
('Judith', 'Yeah, just a bit ago. Those Buzzraider guys never<br/>learn, I swear.')
('Judith', 'Seriously, thanks, Marielle. I saw you out there in<br/>Oración, too, giving it 110% like you always do.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'You, haha... You really think so? Hearing you say that<br/>makes my heart all...')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'All...?')
('Nina', '...Uh-huh.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "...Wh-What?! It's not like that! I just... My emotions<br/>got the better of—I mean, no, they didn't!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "I mean, I feel really thankful for all the help<br/>I've gotten! Not JUST from Dingo, okay?!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "I'm just...happy, you know?")
('Nina', 'Oh, Marielle...')
('Bergard', '...')
('System', '...')
('Van', "...Well, uhh, that's good to hear.")
('Judith', "I've got it. I wanna repay you for setting everything<br/>up for us, so how about I treat you to a<br/>little makeover?")
('Judith', "I know the perfect place. Nina, Saara, why don't you<br/>two come along with us?")
('Judith', 'Oh, and Shaheena, and... Oooh, how about<br/>you, Agnès?')
('Agnès', 'I—ME?!')
('Judith', "Oh, and Shaheena, and... Oooh, why don't we bring<br/>Feri along, too?")
('Feri', 'Wait, me?')
('Judith', "Oh, and Shaheena, and... Oooh, let's get you all<br/>spruced up, Risette!")
('Risette', 'Erm...')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'W-W-Wait, you want to treat me?!')
('Judith', "If I didn't, I wouldn't have offered! It's the least I can<br/>do, really.")
('Judith', "A girl's gotta look good when she takes the<br/>stage, y'know?")
('Judith', "The limelight's coming your way, I can just tell.<br/>This is your chance to get used to all the attention!")
('Judith', "Then, when you get to strut your stuff to the one<br/>you...ahem, APPRECIATE, you'll look good when<br/>you do it!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', '...!')
('Nina', 'Judith...')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', '...Okay! Sounds like a plan!')
('Judith', 'Atta girl!')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'Shaheena might be a tad young for this, though.<br/>Heehee.')
('Nina', "Mmm... I just wish Judith's friend Rixia could've<br/>tagged along with us. She was supposed to be<br/>back today...")
('Van', '(Huh...)')
('Aaron', "(Heh. Can't keep a good girl down.)")
('Quatre', "(They're quite the headstrong bunch. Like a certain<br/>someone I know...)")
('Bergard', "(Quite the firecrackers, aren't they? Haha.)")
('Rocksmith', 'Ah, good to see you, Van. Been a while since<br/>Longlai, eh?')
('Rocksmith', 'You as well, Master Bergard. So nice to see<br/>you again.')
('Bergard', "Indeed. I hope you've been well.")
('Rocksmith', 'Oh, good to see you two. Been a while since<br/>Longlai, eh?')
('Van', "Hey, c'mon, Mr. Prez. Think about your position<br/>for a second, yeah?")
('Agnès', "Well, it's good to see you again, Mr. President.")
('Risette', 'Pleased to see you again, Mr. President.')
('Quatre', "It's, er, good to see you again, Mr. President.")
('Feri', 'Oh, I saw you on the ceremony broadcast!')
('Judith', '(Wait, Rocksmith is here, too?)')
('Judith', '(I mean, we do know each other from Longlai, but he<br/>still gives me stage fright...)')
('Aaron', "Huh. Fan and the crown prince shootin' the shit<br/>over drinks? Now there's somethin' you don't see<br/>every day.")
('Aaron', "Couldn't even tell you were all here until we were<br/>right in front of you. That's the Flying Swallow<br/>for you.")
('Van', "Also, Fan and the crown prince shootin' the shit<br/>over drinks? Now there's somethin' you don't see<br/>every day.")
('Van', "Couldn't even tell you were all here until we were<br/>right in front of you. That's the Flying Swallow<br/>for you.")
('Kilika', "Oh, don't give me too much credit. They owe<br/>much to their excellent attendants.")
('Agnès', 'Oh!')
('Quatre', 'Ah...!')
('Judith', 'Whoa—!')
('Feri', 'Oh, good. I thought my senses were playing tricks<br/>on me.')
('Risette', 'I had felt something faint...')
('Bergard', 'Heh. Well done.')
('Fan', 'Well, perhaps I can think of this as a little Longlai<br/>reunion party.')
('Fan', 'These sorts of meetings are few and far between—<br/>how could I refuse?')
('Prince Sherid', 'Incidentally, I told Naje to take a few days off.')
('Prince Sherid', 'Dare I say, this company here can fend for themselves<br/>just fine.')
('Van', "Glad to hear Naje's getting a break. I actually just ran<br/>into her a while ago.")
('Van', "Glad to hear Naje's getting a break. She always looks<br/>like you're keepin' her busy.")
('Van', "Aaanyway, I'm sure you guys got a buncha stuff you<br/>wanna talk about.")
('Van', "I'll mosey on out of here before your bodyguards glare<br/>a hole in my skull.")
('Warrant Officer Cody', "I'm not GLARING...")
('Kilika', "Come now, you've no need to stand on formality in<br/>this company.")
('Rocksmith', "You're right, you're right. Why not take a seat and<br/>help yourself to some skewers?")
('Rocksmith', 'This was one of my favorite local haunts back when I<br/>was in office. The skewers pair perfectly with a cold<br/>glass of Far Eastern sake!')
('Fan', "Heh, yes, I think you'll find the sake crisp<br/>and refreshing. Quite different from the aged stuff<br/>you'll find elsewhere.")
('Prince Sherid', 'Speaking of, looks like you two have empty glasses.<br/>How about another round on me?')
('Nina', '...')
('Nina', "...Yes, that's just fine. As we speak, the threads of fate<br/>are coming together.")
('Nina', 'When the time comes, I will make my move.')
('Van', '(...Huh?)')
('Judith', 'Uhh, Nina?')
('Nina', 'Oh, Judith. And the Arkride crew, too.')
('Nina', 'What are you all doing he... Er, haha. I guess you<br/>could ask me the same.')
('Aaron', "Yeah, I think I will. The hell're you up to, lady?")
('Feri', "It sounded like you were talking to someone, but you<br/>don't have a device or anything.")
('Nina', "Oh, dear. Umm... Yeah, that's a bad habit of mine.<br/>Sometimes I just sorta switch into character and<br/>recite my lines when nobody's around.")
('Nina', "I'm sure Judith could tell you all about it... She's seen<br/>me do it once or twice.")
('Nina', "Obviously it's kinda creepy when I do it, so I try to<br/>make sure I'm alone when I practice.")
('Risette', 'That does sound fair.')
('Agnès', "Oh, right, I remember hearing about that. They say<br/>you get really into character—almost like<br/>you're possessed!")
('Bergard', '(Hmm...)')
('Judith', "Yeah, I've kinda gotten used to it, but maybe pack it<br/>in at times like this, yeah?")
('Judith', "Once this is all over, I'd be happy to help you practice<br/>your lines as much as you need.")
('Nina', "Ah...! Haha, I think I'll take you up on that.")
('Nina', "I'm going to head back to the lobby. They need all<br/>the help they can get over there.")
('Nina', 'Take care of yourself, everyone. Promise me,<br/>okay, Judith?')
('Van', 'Roger that.')
('Judith', 'Just be a good girl and wait for this to blow<br/>over, okay?')
('Bracer Regina', "Good work out there, Elaine. You, too, Fie. I don't<br/>even know how to begin thanking you.")
('Bracer Regina', 'Actually, are you two okay coming along? I know you<br/>only just got done with all that.')
('Fie', "Eh, that was mostly just talking. I'm good to go a<br/>little longer.")
('Elaine', "You really held your own, Regina. I'm impressed.")
('Elaine', 'I heard you helped keep Edith safe while I was away.')
('Elaine', 'Even you-know-who had some good things to say.')
('Bracer Regina', "I-I'm sure he was just being nice. I really do depend<br/>on him too much...")
('Bracer Regina', '...On the topic of you-know-who, was he helpful out<br/>at the old capital?')
('Bracer Regina', "He didn't do anything reckless out there, right?<br/>Like, get himself into trouble? Please tell me he didn't<br/>get in your way...")
('Fie', 'Heh. I wonder.')
('Elaine', 'Is that...concern I hear?')
('Bracer Regina', "Wha—n-no! It's just, I don't want a coworker<br/>making us all look bad! I hope he's doing okay for<br/>HIS sake!")
('Bracer Regina', "I know he's been worried about looking good lately,<br/>since he's got that promotion lined up.")
('Bracer Regina', "I'm just worried he's acting riskier because of it.<br/>Especially with what happened to Ewan.")
('Elaine', "True. Bracer ranks are more than just skill—there's a<br/>fair bit of luck in the equation, too.")
('Elaine', 'But Alvis will be fine, rest assured.')
('Fie', 'Yeah, he looked real shaken when he heard about<br/>that Ewan guy.')
('Fie', 'But he turned right around and backed us up the<br/>whole way, along with Lahad and Xiaoling.')
('Fie', 'Seemed like proof enough to me that he knows how<br/>to focus and prioritize.')
('Bracer Regina', "I see... Well, good. He'd better be able to clear his<br/>head like that if he wants to get that B-rank.")
('Fie', "There it is. NOW she's speaking her mind.")
('Elaine', "You know, you're not far off yourself. Why not join<br/>him on the job now and then?")
('Bracer Regina', "Well...maybe. I'll give it some thought.")
('Van', '(Huh. Looks like Elaine and the other bracers are<br/>having an afterparty. I thought they all split up<br/>after they got back.)')
('Van', '(Huh. Looks like Elaine and the other bracers are<br/>having an afterparty. I thought they all split up<br/>after they got back.)')
('Van', "(Not a group I want to stick my nose in, but they<br/>might take it the wrong way if I pretend I don't<br/>see 'em.)")
('System', 'Break the Demon Stone?')
('System', 'Break the Demon Stone?')
('System', 'Break the Demon Stone?')
('Van', "(Heard some b-ball team from Seiden's been makin'<br/>waves lately. This guy looks like the team captain.)")
('Van', 'Hey there. Got time for a quick question?')
('Simon', "Yeah? What's up?")
('Van', "We're from Arkride Solutions, and we're workin' on<br/>an investigation right now.")
('Van', 'You know anything about a guy named Mark who<br/>hangs around with Desire?')
('Simon', "Mark, huh...? Yeah, I know him. You lookin'<br/>into him?")
('Agnès', 'Yes, we received a request from his girlfriend.')
('Agnès', "She hasn't heard from him in over a month, so she'd<br/>like us to find him.")
('Feri', "Yeah, we got a request from Mark's girlfriend.")
('Feri', "She said she wanted us to find him, since she hasn't<br/>heard from him for over a month.")
('Aaron', "Yeah, Mark's girl wants us to drag his ass back.")
('Aaron', "Hasn't heard from him for over a month.")
('Van', "What I understand, you've been buds with him since<br/>you were kids.")
('Van', "You got any idea what he's been up to lately?")
('Simon', "Huh. So she ain't heard from him, either?")
('Simon', "I'd kinda been expecting bad news but...man, he<br/>really went and screwed himself over, didn't he?")
('Van', "Sounds like you know somethin' about what he's<br/>gotten himself into. Care to elaborate?")
('Simon', "Well, if his girl... If Amy sent you, then I guess it<br/>wouldn't hurt to tell you.")
('Simon', "I figure you guys know what's best for him. Right?")
('Simon', "So, a month ago I got this letter from him, and it's<br/>weird because he never does that. Ever.")
('Simon', 'Said they gave him a job to sneak into some jaeger<br/>camp outside of Baume City. Why? Dunno.')
('Simon', "He told me it was some kinda trial. They were gonna<br/>have him go out there by himself and scout the<br/>enemy, or somethin'.")
('Agnès', '(Oh, no...)')
('Feri', 'I was afraid that was it...')
('Aaron', '(Called it.)')
('Simon', 'He sent me that message the night before he was<br/>supposed to go.')
('Simon', "He... You could tell he was shakin' when he wrote it.<br/>He said, 'I dunno if I'm coming back from this<br/>one, man.'")
('Simon', 'Wrote about Amy, too...')
('Simon', "'If I don't make it home, tell her I ran off with some<br/>other girl.'")
('Simon', "'I don't want her grieving for me.'")
('Van', '...')
('Simon', "...Stupid son of a bitch. He didn't want her to grieve,<br/>he shoulda come back ALIVE!")
('Simon', "Been with him since we were kids, and I couldn't help<br/>him when he needed it most! Friggin'...!")
('Simon', 'Sorry, just... I need a sec to cool off. It hurts, man...')
('Van', 'No problem. Take your time.')
('Van', '...I think we got the gist of this now.')
('Van', "We got a foreign power that picked up some jaegers<br/>to try and do somethin' about you-know-who...")
('Van', "...and they responded by gettin' Desire to do some<br/>dirty work and rough up that same jaeger squad<br/>for 'em.")
('Van', 'And Mark was the unlucky bastard they picked for<br/>the job.')
('Agnès', 'But then A raided the jaeger<br/>detachment themselves...')
('Agnès', "That lines up with what Eddy said, doesn't it? In that<br/>case, Mark may still be alive.")
('Agnès', "We can't rule out that he might have gotten out of<br/>there safely.")
('Feri', 'But then those jaegers got raided and wiped out by<br/>A, right?')
('Feri', "It's like what Eddy said... Maybe Mark is still<br/>alive, then!")
('Feri', "He might have gotten out safely and just hasn't told<br/>anyone about it... Maybe.")
('Aaron', 'And then A went and smashed up those<br/>jaegers anyway.')
('Aaron', "Our guy might've just slipped away during all that.<br/>He may still be kicking, for all we know.")
('Van', "It's possible, yeah. We just don't have enough info to<br/>go on as of yet.")
('Van', 'We should try to find that article Sylvie told us about.')
('Agnès', 'What does it say?')
('Feri', 'What does it say?')
('Aaron', "What's it say?")
('Van', "I'll read it. Headline: 'Jaeger Corps Suddenly Gunned<br/>Down Outside Baume City'...")
('Van', "'According to local reports, a jaeger formation outside<br/>Baume City suddenly and violently engaged with an<br/>unknown aggressor.'")
('Van', "'However, both sides retreated without a trace<br/>afterward, leaving little evidence behind.'")
('Van', "...'Authorities did find the body of a young man not<br/>far from the scene of the incident.'")
('Agnès', 'Oh...')
('Feri', '...')
('Aaron', '...')
('Van', "'Forensic analysis indicated that the boy died one or<br/>two days before the incident is thought to<br/>have occurred.'")
('Van', "'Authorities are investigating how the boy might have<br/>been connected to the battle, but so far, they have<br/>been unable to identify him'...")
('Van', "...and that's it.")
('Agnès', "They haven't identified him, but...with all the<br/>evidence we have...")
('Feri', "They didn't figure out who it was, but it sounds like it<br/>was Mark...")
('Aaron', "They didn't say who it was, but it all lines up. I think<br/>we gotta call it.")
('Van', 'Well...I guess Mark got the last laugh in the end.<br/>Those jaegers got burned out there.')
('Van', "He didn't come back for Amy, and I think that just<br/>about closes the case.")
('Van', "Y'know...he did good, for some boy in over his head.")
('Simon', "...I guess that's it, then.")
('Simon', "He's just... He's gone.")
('Agnès', 'Simon! Were you listening in on us?')
('Feri', 'Simon! So you heard, just now?')
('Aaron', 'You listened in, huh?')
('Simon', 'Yeah, just that bit at the end. I kinda already knew,<br/>but...yeah.')
('Simon', 'I had to know for sure, as his old friend.')
('Van', 'Yeah.')
('Simon', 'But do I tell Amy, is the thing...?')
('Simon', 'I dunno what to do... What do you guys think?')
('Van', 'Mark made up that lie for you to tell her, right?')
('Simon', 'Yeah... Anything to keep her happy. But this is gonna<br/>break her heart either way...')
('Simon', "Do I tell her the truth or do I honor Mark's last<br/>request...?")
('Van', "We'll think on that for you. Once we loop back with<br/>her, we'll tell her what we think is right.")
('Simon', "Thanks. That'd be a weight off my shoulders.")
('Simon', 'I gotta head out. Take care of Amy, yeah?')
('Agnès', 'So...what will you tell her?')
('Feri', 'So that wraps up our investigation, but now what do<br/>we tell Amy?')
('Aaron', 'So, how we gonna break it to her?')
('Van', 'Lemme think on that for a bit. Not an easy decision<br/>to make.')
('Van', "We've got time to think while we head over to her,<br/>at least.")
('Van', "They want us to test some kinda<br/>mystery-solving game? Man, can't I get normal<br/>requests for once?")
('Van', 'And why the hell do they need a spriggan for it?')
('Agnès', "The 'full body' part does have me curious, though.<br/>It sounds like fun!")
('Feri', "It sounds kinda fun, though! Oh, but what do they<br/>mean by 'full body'?")
('Aaron', "I'm just trying to figure out what they meant by<br/>'full body.' Sounds suggestive.")
('Van', 'I mean, fair.')
('Van', "Guess it wouldn't hurt to at least read the pamphlet<br/>they gave us.")
('Van', "Lessee here... 'Princess in Peril! Save the Kingdom's<br/>Fair Maiden!' The hell...?")
('System', 'The Kingdom of Edith is in chaos, for its fair princess<br/>has been kidnapped!')
('System', 'Edith calls upon you, o gallant knight, to save her<br/>from those villains!')
('System', 'Collect the three keys and free the princess from her<br/>hidden prison!')
('Agnès', 'Wow, heehee. They really went all in on the setup.')
('Agnès', "We're citizens of the Kingdom of Edith, off to rescue<br/>our princess? It sounds kind of fun!")
('Feri', "Huh. Well, it's got an interesting setup.")
('Feri', "So we're supposed to be citizens of the kingdom<br/>for this?")
('Aaron', "Damned if that isn't a setup. Think we'll get a happy<br/>ending when we rescue her?")
('Aaron', "All right, sign me up—this actually sounds like fun.<br/>I'll be a royal subject for a day.")
('Van', 'Ehh... Sounds harmless enough. Oh, I think this card<br/>here is our first clue.')
('System', 'The first key lies hidden within the Seiden District.<br/>Seek the mistress tailor on the cutting edge<br/>of fashion.')
('Van', "Well, that's pretty specific. Helps us narrow it down.")
('Van', "Guess if we ain't got anything better to do, we can go<br/>give this a look.")
('System', 'Quest QA Testing started!')
('Van', '(Oh, yeah. We got that mystery-solving thingy.)')
('Van', "('Mistress tailor on the cutting edge of fashion,' huh?<br/>The manager here fits the bill.)")
('Van', "Do you have a minute? We're doing this<br/>mystery-solving game thing.")
('Van', "Said to look for a 'mistress tailor.' That you,<br/>by chance?")
('Manager Mohra', "My, my. I wasn't expecting anyone to figure it out<br/>that quickly.")
('Manager Mohra', "I am indeed the mistress you seek—I'm the royal<br/>family's personal tailor!")
('Manager Mohra', "And since I have a key...you must have figured out<br/>that I'm complicit in the princess' kidnapping as well.<br/>Alas, I am unmasked!")
('Van', "Sure thing. You're, uhh, way more into this than I<br/>was expecting.")
('Agnès', "Well, heehee! I see what they mean by<br/>'full body' now. Should we get in character<br/>ourselves, maybe?")
('Feri', "Oh, wow. She's really in-character. So that's what<br/>they meant by 'full body'!")
('Aaron', "So that's what they meant by 'full body'... Meh.<br/>Was hoping for more, but maybe it'd be fun to get in<br/>character like they're doing.")
('Van', "I mean, I don't care. Do whatever you want.")
('Manager Mohra', "Now that I've been found out... Oh, dear! What's a<br/>conspirator like me to do?")
('Manager Mohra', "I'll give you the key if you just let me go! I promise!")
('Manager Mohra', 'I... Er, to be honest, I was against kidnapping her<br/>from the start. Truly!')
('Manager Mohra', "But a certain someone gave me an offer I couldn't<br/>refuse—treasure beyond my wildest dreams. I simply<br/>had to play along.")
('Van', 'Evidently bribery is a big problem in this kingdom.')
('Van', "Who's the 'certain someone,' though?")
('Manager Mohra', "Oh, forgive me, I just can't say.")
('Manager Mohra', "But a promise is a promise! Here's the first key and<br/>the next clue. Best of luck!")
('System', 'Van retrieved the first key!')
('Van', "So this here's the next puzzle? Lemme take a look...")
('System', 'Look to the river for your next key, where a metal box<br/>ferries passengers underground. The man watching<br/>over it holds the key.')
('Agnès', 'A metal box by the river, it says... I can only think of<br/>one place that fits the description.')
('Feri', "A 'metal box' near the river? Hmm... I think I know<br/>where that is?")
('Aaron', "Well, that's obvious. Give us something a little<br/>tougher next time, why don'tcha?")
('Manager Mohra', "I'll be watching over your progress, if you don't mind.")
('Manager Mohra', 'Only you can set her free, brave knight. Her fate is in<br/>your hands.')
('Manager Mohra', 'Phew. Right, how did I do?')
('Van', 'Pretty good. Sold the whole corrupt aide thing<br/>pretty well.')
('Van', "...Damn it, now I'm invested. Feel like I gotta see the<br/>game to the end now.")
('Manager Mohra', 'Well, thank you! This has been a fun change of pace<br/>for me, heehee.')
('Agnès', 'Well, then, shall we go search for the next key?')
('Feri', "Okay, let's go look for the next key!")
('Aaron', "Doesn't take much to win you over, does it? Let's go<br/>get that next key.")
('Van', "All right, here's the Maserati.")
('Agnès', 'Twenty years ago, Bruno stole a locket from a guest<br/>staying here, do I have that right?')
('Agnès', "Let's see if we can talk to someone who was around at<br/>the time.")
('Feri', 'So twenty years ago, Bruno stole a locket from<br/>somebody here, right?')
('Feri', "Let's try and find someone who was around<br/>back then.")
('Aaron', "Twenty years ago, our old man snatched a dude's<br/>locket here.")
('Aaron', "If we can find somebody who was working here back<br/>then, that'd help.")
('Van', "Yeah, but we can't just walk up and ask. That'd be a<br/>bit suspicious.")
('Van', 'Best course of action would be finding an employee<br/>and sorta working our way toward that slowly.')
('Van', 'Hey. Sorry to interrupt.')
('Van', "We're from Arkride Solutions, and we're trying to dig<br/>up some info on a case that happened here.")
('Van', 'Do you remember any instances of theft here at the<br/>hotel around...twenty-ish years ago?')
('Cremona', 'Theft? Let me think...')
('Cremona', "I've been working here for a while, but I don't<br/>remember hearing about anything like that.")
('Agnès', 'I see. Thank you.')
('Feri', 'Really? Huh...')
('Aaron', 'Swing and a miss, then.')
('Cremona', "We DID have a major incident here twenty years<br/>ago, but I don't think it's what you're referring to.")
('Van', 'Oh? What happened?')
('Cremona', "A-Ahem. Well, I'd prefer to keep this on the down<br/>low, but if it helps the investigation...")
('Cremona', 'Twenty years ago, the hotel was attacked by terrorists.')
('Agnès', "A terrorist attack?! I'd never heard of it—and so close<br/>to home, too...")
('Feri', 'What?! A terrorist attack, right in the middle<br/>of town?')
('Aaron', 'Damn. Even the capital gets potshots every now and<br/>then, huh?')
('Cremona', 'Yes... It claimed the life of Senator Taylor and<br/>his family.')
('Cremona', 'The staff at the time had no idea what to make of<br/>it—some of us thought it was some sort of conspiracy.')
('Van', 'Man... The whole family just got wiped out like that?')
('Cremona', "Well, we're not 100% sure. The government quickly<br/>swooped in and kept all the information under wraps.")
('Cremona', "In truth, we still don't know if there were any<br/>survivors among his family.")
('Cremona', 'Oh, but now that I think about it, Senator Polanski<br/>may know more about the incident. He and Taylor<br/>were colleagues, I believe.')
('Van', "All right, thanks. I'll chat him up.")
('Agnès', "(So, Bruno said he stole someone's locket, but...)")
('Agnès', '(...could it have had something to do with the<br/>terrorist attack, too?)')
('Feri', "(Bruno said he stole somebody's locket...)")
('Feri', '(Maybe that had something to do with the terrorist<br/>attack, too?)')
('Aaron', "(Old man said he nicked somebody's locket...)")
('Aaron', '(...but that smells like a coverup to me. Maybe he had<br/>a hand in that attack, too.)')
('Van', "(Yeah, it's got me suspicious, too, but let's do some<br/>more diggin' before we jump to conclusions.)")
('Van', 'Hey there. Sorry to butt in.')
('Van', "We're from Arkride Solutions, and we're diggin'<br/>around for some info on an incident that<br/>happened here.")
('Van', 'Mind if we pull you aside for a sec?')
('Senator Polanski', "I see... Well, yes, I don't mind.")
('Senator Polanski', 'May I step away for a bit, Jennifer?')
('President Jennifer', "Of course. I'll be here enjoying my tea.")
('Senator Polanski', 'An incident, you say? What might you be referring<br/>to, and what would I know about it?')
('Van', "It's about Senator Taylor... That incident twenty<br/>years ago.")
('Senator Polanski', '...Who told you?')
('Van', 'I have my sources.')
('Van', "I've got something to deliver to his next of kin, if he's<br/>got any.")
('Van', 'Actually, just to make sure, can you confirm this guy<br/>in the photo here is Taylor?')
('Senator Polanski', "It's been an age since I've seen that face...")
('Senator Polanski', "That's him, yes.")
('Agnès', '(So, does that mean...)')
('Agnès', "(...Bruno wasn't just committing a robbery. He was<br/>connected to the terrorist attack, too?)")
('Feri', '(Does that mean what I think it means?)')
('Feri', "(Bruno wasn't a thief, he was a terrorist?)")
('Aaron', '(Called it.)')
('Aaron', "(Old man wasn't just robbing the place—he was in<br/>cahoots with the terrorists.)")
('Van', "You mind fillin' us in on what happened that day?")
('Senator Polanski', 'Well...if it would help your investigation, I suppose I<br/>can tell you what I know.')
('Senator Polanski', "Taylor was a fellow Republican Party member.<br/>He and I weren't particularly close, but I respected<br/>him as a political ally.")
('Senator Polanski', 'He was especially active on the subject of<br/>race relations. He had a flair for these passionate,<br/>fiery speeches in parliament.')
('Agnès', 'I see...')
('Agnès', 'I remember reading that racial tensions were rising at<br/>the time, due to increasing immigration.')
('Agnès', 'That lasted all the way until President Rocksmith<br/>helped quell the tensions.')
('Feri', 'Wow, so he was really big?')
('Aaron', 'Real cock of the walk, huh?')
('Van', 'Yeah, but right at his highest, he got wiped out just<br/>like that.')
('Senator Polanski', "I'll never forget that night...")
('Senator Polanski', 'He was staying here for a family vacation...<br/>They came into the hotel in the dead of night and<br/>gunned him down in his sleep.')
('Senator Polanski', 'I heard his son miraculously survived, but...both he<br/>and his wife were killed.')
('Van', 'Man... I had no idea.')
('Agnès', '...')
('Feri', "That's just horrible... I remember hearing about<br/>requests like that. Why would anyone do such<br/>a thing...?")
('Aaron', "Buncha cowards. Couldn't beat him in a debate, so<br/>they shut him up by force?")
('Van', 'Do you know where the kid is now?')
('Senator Polanski', "I'm afraid I don't, sorry.")
('Senator Polanski', 'But he was good friends with a man named Huck, if<br/>memory serves. He may be able to help you.')
('Senator Polanski', "Last I heard, he was living in Old Town. If his<br/>address hasn't changed since then, you can find<br/>him there.")
('Agnès', "A 'Huck' living in Old Town? Could it be...?")
('Feri', 'Wait, is that who I...?')
('Aaron', "That rings a bell, don't it?")
('Van', 'Yup. Our favorite old bathhouse lech, if I had to bet.')
('Van', "Fifty mira says he's at the löyly right now.")
('Senator Polanski', "Ah, you're acquainted? Good, good, that should make<br/>things easier.")
('Senator Polanski', "Best of luck with your investigation. Taylor's son<br/>deserves closure on that terrible, terrible day.")
('Van', 'Yo. We got a request from a Rumsfeld. You the guy?')
('Van', "I'm the spriggan from Arkride Solutions.")
('Rumsfeld', "Ah, yes, thank you! It's good to put a face to<br/>the name.")
('Risette', 'Your request entailed rescuing a young lady?')
('Rumsfeld', "Yes, let's get right to it. I haven't much time.")
('Rumsfeld', 'The lady in question is Berzelia, daughter of the<br/>CEO of the Bank of Edith.')
('Rumsfeld', "My name is Rumsfeld, and I serve as the young miss'<br/>butler and bodyguard.")
('Agnès', "Oh, wow! That's one of the biggest financial<br/>institutions in Calvard.")
('Agnès', 'They have a watertight reputation, from what I hear.<br/>They do everything by the book.')
('Feri', "Wow, that's impressive. So she's really rich?")
('Aaron', 'A lady with class, nice. Take notes, Ashen.')
('Van', "Okay, so what's the situation?")
('Rumsfeld', "Right. It brings me shame to admit, but...she's<br/>been kidnapped.")
('Rumsfeld', "We don't know who the perpetrator might be—it<br/>only just happened last night. As her caretaker,<br/>I'm just...")
('Agnès', "Yeah, that's serious...")
('Van', "I was worried that's what it was. Sounds pretty dire.")
('Risette', 'Did the kidnapper make any demands? What other<br/>information do we have to go on?')
('Rumsfeld', 'Well, the young miss is a semi-permanent resident<br/>here at the hotel penthouse, you see.')
('Rumsfeld', 'Her father arranged it for her, hoping it would let her<br/>live more on her own terms than if she were at<br/>his home.')
('Rumsfeld', 'But last night the young miss slipped away for a night<br/>to herself, and she...she failed to return.')
('Rumsfeld', 'This morning, we found a ransom note delivered to<br/>the hotel, written for the president.')
('Rumsfeld', "'We have your daughter. Ten million mira in cash.'")
('Rumsfeld', "'Bring the money to the exchange point. Bring police<br/>or bracers, and we kill her.'")
('Risette', 'Indeed... Some individual or group has captured her.')
('Rumsfeld', 'The culprit also sent the mobile terminal Berzelia has<br/>been using.')
('Rumsfeld', "They're meticulous, to a terrifying degree. That's why<br/>I turn to you: we need your help to investigate<br/>these villains.")
('Rumsfeld', "We'd also like you to accompany her father to the<br/>exchange point.")
('Van', "Ohh, I get'cha. They said no police or bracers...but<br/>maybe they'll count a spriggan as an exception.")
('Van', "(Okay. We all right takin' this on now?)")
('Rumsfeld', 'My request is twofold, to clarify.')
('Rumsfeld', 'First, I ask that you investigate the criminals on<br/>our behalf.')
('Rumsfeld', 'Second, I ask you to accompany her father to the<br/>exchange point.')
('Rumsfeld', 'Can I entrust you with this?')
('Van', "Sure. They said no police or bracers, and you're in<br/>luck, 'cause we ain't either.")
('Van', "(Okay. We all right takin' this on now?)")
('Van', 'We got our hands full with some other stuff<br/>right now...')
('Van', 'You good if we get back to you later?')
('Rumsfeld', 'Of course. We do have time until the handover, so<br/>you can sort out whatever other business you have.')
('Rumsfeld', "I shall wait here for when you're available.")
('Van', "We're on the case.")
('Rumsfeld', 'Thank you ever so much. I knew I could count<br/>on you.')
('Van', 'So first off, can we talk to the dad? Where is he?')
('Rumsfeld', 'Well, the CEO... Her father, rather, is often busy<br/>with his work.')
('Rumsfeld', "He's currently overseeing a project to bring orbal<br/>network coverage to rural areas in Calvard.")
('Rumsfeld', "As this involves traveling to said areas, he has no<br/>network signal out there. We've been unable to<br/>contact him.")
('Feri', "Yeah, that's a problem. If he doesn't have any signal,<br/>we straight-up can't call him, right?")
('Aaron', "So it's not even ignorance—he's just so far out in the<br/>boonies that nobody can get a hold of him.")
('Aaron', "Go figure he isn't around when his kid needs him<br/>most, though. What, did he tell her he was going out<br/>for milk or something?")
('Agnès', 'Have some tact, Aaron.')
('Van', 'Yeesh, talk about bad timing.')
('Van', 'So that pretty much puts him out of the question.<br/>We gotta do this on our own, sounds like.')
('Rumsfeld', 'I did observe some strange behavior that might be<br/>relevant to the case.')
('Rumsfeld', "Lately, Berzelia has been refusing her bodyguards'<br/>company when she goes out...")
('Rumsfeld', 'She frequents the Tyrell District on those days.')
('Risette', 'I see...')
('Rumsfeld', 'We would keep a watch on her from a distance when<br/>she would go there...')
('Rumsfeld', '...and we found that she had befriended this young<br/>man who... Pardon my judgment, but he has the air<br/>of a ruffian about him.')
('Agnès', 'Huh... Could he have roped Berzelia into<br/>something shady?')
('Rumsfeld', 'Well, in spite of it, their interactions were<br/>surprisingly cordial.')
('Rumsfeld', 'The young man would buy her ice cream, take her<br/>to movies... By all accounts, they were simple friends.')
('Rumsfeld', 'We had thought she was in good hands and that we<br/>could give her her space, but...evidently not.')
('Agnès', "I see. That makes me curious about the young<br/>man's background.")
('Van', "Same. Let's get to work—first up: Tyrell.")
('Feri', 'Oh, do we have some time before they want the<br/>ransom money?')
('Aaron', 'Hey, how much time have we got before they off her?')
('Rumsfeld', 'We do have time. By all means, take whatever time<br/>you need to investigate.')
('Rumsfeld', "The criminals specified Dirke Memorial Park as the<br/>exchange point. I will await you at the<br/>park's entrance.")
('Rumsfeld', "Once you've completed your investigation, please<br/>rendezvous with me.")
('Van', 'Sounds like a plan.')
('Van', "All right, gang. Let's get out there and start diggin'<br/>for clues.")
('Van', "Let's hit up that ice cream vendor first, see what they<br/>have to say.")
('Risette', "Understood. I'll keep tabs on the time we have left<br/>until the handover.")
('System', 'Quest A Daughter in Danger started!')
('Van', 'Hey there. You the one who put that request up?')
('Oslo', 'Oh, yes! Then you must be...!')
('Quatre', "I believe your request was about some trouble you've<br/>had on the orbal net?")
('Quatre', "I'm hardly an expert, but I do have some knowledge<br/>of the subject.")
('Quatre', 'Would you mind explaining the situation?')
('Oslo', 'Yes. Well, in short, I... Erm, I fell for a scam on the<br/>orbal net.')
('Van', "One of those net scams, huh? Been a lot of that<br/>goin' around.")
('Quatre', 'Phishing is the technical term. Bad faith actors<br/>disguise themselves as legitimate sources to fool<br/>end users.')
('Quatre', 'With how quickly the orbal net is growing, these<br/>threats are one step ahead of common knowledge and<br/>security measures.')
('Quatre', "So it falls to the users themselves to stay safe on the<br/>net, and many just don't have that awareness yet.<br/>It's still a very new thing.")
('Oslo', 'At any rate, I wanted to get some advice from<br/>someone more knowledgeable about these things.')
('Oslo', 'Will you accept my request?')
('Oslo', 'That acquaintance of yours, he seems to know his<br/>way around the orbal net. I was hoping he could<br/>help me.')
('Oslo', 'Would you be able to take my request right now?')
('Van', 'Net fraud, huh? I might need to do some research<br/>before I can tackle a case like that.')
('Van', 'Lemme think on it for a bit, sorry.')
('Oslo', 'I understand. Please do come by if you find the time.')
('Van', "Sure, we'll take it. Care to fill us in?")
('Oslo', "Of course. Let's go somewhere we can talk.")
('Feri', 'Oh, so have you talked to the police about it?<br/>Since you got scammed.')
('Aaron', "So you didn't go to the cops first, did you? They could<br/>help with getting your shit back.")
('Risette', 'May I ask, have you brought this matter to the police?<br/>They may be able to retrieve your stolen assets.')
('Oslo', "Oh, no. It's just, I, uh...")
('Van', 'Well, you got your reasons, sounds like. No worries.')
('Oslo', "Yes. I ask for your utmost secrecy regarding what I'm<br/>about to tell you.")
('Van', "Don't you worry. We take our clients' privacy very<br/>seriously here at Arkride Solutions.")
('Oslo', "Well, you see... Now, umm... Oh, this is just<br/>so pathetic. I can't even spit it out.")
('Van', "Man, stop beating around the bush. I won't know<br/>how to help if I don't know what the problem is.")
('Oslo', 'Ergh...')
('Oslo', 'Bah, screw it! SO! I used my work terminal to look<br/>up...s-swimsuit models!')
('Oslo', 'Like...the hot ones! Oh, Goddess almighty, just<br/>kill me!')
('Feri', 'Hot...? Swimsuits? Like, on fire? Am<br/>I misunderstanding?')
('Agnès', "Erm... Don't think too hard on it, okay, Feri?")
('Aaron', "...And? Everybody's gotta take a load off every now<br/>and then. What's the problem?")
('Quatre', "I think I understand where this is going, but please,<br/>there's no need to shout.")
('Oslo', "I-I'm so sorry!")
('Van', "I think I get where this is goin', though. Carry on?")
('Oslo', 'So, a few days later, I got this message FROM<br/>the website. They said they had my browsing history!<br/>And that I had to pay to keep it private!')
('Oslo', "I-I just... I didn't see anything on that site implying I<br/>needed to pay, so...")
('Oslo', "I... I just sent the mira immediately. I couldn't bear to<br/>risk having my reputation tarnished.")
('Oslo', 'I thought that would be the end of it. But then,<br/>another few days pass...and they message me again!')
('Oslo', "They said they wanted even more mira this time, or<br/>they'd leak my browsing history AND all my private<br/>information, too!")
('Quatre', 'I see.')
('Agnès', "That's awful...")
('Oslo', 'As a consultant, my reputation is paramount. I need<br/>to maintain a clean and professional image.')
('Oslo', "I can't have my browsing history floating around on<br/>the net—much less my private info! I'd be done for!")
('Quatre', "And that's why you couldn't bring this to the police or<br/>the guild?")
('Oslo', "Yes. My entire career in jeopardy because of one<br/>stupid mistake... I'm pathetic.")
('Van', "That's the thing with those scams: you gotta just<br/>ignore 'em.")
('Oslo', 'I... How?')
('Van', "So, it's like one or two people doing these, usually.<br/>And these guys know they're full of shit, but they<br/>figure some of their victims don't.")
('Van', 'They just blast these requests out to anybody they can<br/>find, hoping that somebody falls for it.')
('Van', "Once they get a bite, they zero in hard on anybody<br/>who replies and ignore everyone else. That's how<br/>these things work.")
('Oslo', 'Oh, then can I just ignore it going forward?')
('Van', "Nah, it ain't that easy now that you took the bait.")
('Van', "You already gave 'em some mira already, and that let<br/>'em know you fell for it.")
('Van', "They know you're willin' to pay to keep that info<br/>secret—that you care about your rep.")
('Van', "You're exactly the kinda guy they want.")
('Van', "Now that they know that, they wanna milk you for all<br/>you're worth. They're gonna hound you.")
('Van', "You cut 'em off and they might actually leak<br/>your shit.")
('Oslo', 'Oh, no...')
('Agnès', "You're surprisingly knowledgeable about these kinds<br/>of scams...")
('Van', 'Yeah, I, uhh, I dealt with a case like this before.')
('Agnès', '...Right.')
('Aaron', "Come on man—don't try to hide it. I bet your<br/>terminal's chock full of porn.")
('Aaron', 'Hey, you still got your nudes on there? Heh heh.')
('Van', 'YOU keep your teenage fantasies to yourself!')
('Van', "Anyway, those're my two mira.")
('Van', "You can keep givin' em money or you can ignore 'em.<br/>It's your call.")
('Oslo', "I can't do that, obviously. I suppose I'll have to just...<br/>give in to their demands.")
('Van', "...And? They're not just gonna stop. You gonna keep<br/>sending 'em more and more money?")
('Oslo', 'I...')
('Quatre', 'Ideally, we would just apprehend the criminals here.')
('Oslo', 'Can we really do that?!')
('Oslo', 'I-I mean, can you really track down a criminal hiding<br/>on the orbal network?')
('Quatre', "Well, it would depend on how well they hide their<br/>identity, but it probably wouldn't be impossible.")
('Oslo', 'Really?!')
('Oslo', 'Then, please! Please get them for me!')
('Quatre', 'Are you okay with that, Van?')
('Van', "Go nuts. You're the expert here. If we can track 'em<br/>down, then let's go for it.")
('Quatre', 'Roger.')
('Quatre', 'All right. May I borrow the terminal they contacted<br/>you on?')
('Oslo', 'Here it is. I use this terminal for work.')
('Van', "Damn. Pretty cushy job if they're handin' out<br/>gadgets like this. But, uhh...")
('Quatre', 'Yeah, that was a bit...easy.')
('Oslo', 'Umm... Is something the matter?')
('Quatre', 'Think about what you just did, for a second.')
('Quatre', "Your mobile terminal is like a collection of all your<br/>personal data, and you just handed it to me—a<br/>stranger—without a moment's hesitation.")
('Quatre', "You're very lax with your data, and that can get you<br/>into trouble—especially since this doubles as your<br/>work terminal.")
('Oslo', "I... Well, that's a good point.")
('Quatre', 'Now, obviously I have no intention of stealing your<br/>data, but it helps to be more cautious on the net.')
('Quatre', "It's best to store your personal info separately from<br/>your work terminal, along with anything else you<br/>don't want other people to see.")
('Oslo', 'That does make sense. If I may go ahead and do that<br/>real quick...')
('Oslo', 'I have this note terminal that I also use for work.<br/>That should do.')
('Oslo', '...There, that should be good. I leave the rest to you.')
('Quatre', "Okay, you've still got your history on here. Good.<br/>Now if I just do a reverse search on the sender of<br/>this message...")
('Feri', 'Did you find something?')
('Aaron', 'Find anything?')
('Risette', 'Have you found anything?')
('Quatre', 'Yup. I can see it all.')
('Van', "Let's hear it.")
('Quatre', 'It looks like the criminal was using a mobile terminal<br/>themselves to contact you.')
('Quatre', "I doubt it's a brand machine—it's most likely a<br/>cheap knock-off. These operations don't tend to be<br/>very sophisticated.")
('Quatre', 'And sure enough, they made absolutely no attempt to<br/>mask their identity. I can trace them right now.')
('Agnès', 'Are you able to find out where they are?')
('Quatre', 'I believe so. It might help if I explain how these<br/>network signals work.')
('Quatre', "Mobile terminals transmit their own broadcast<br/>signals, but being so small, they're limited in their<br/>scope and strength.")
('Quatre', 'As a result, they have to pass through a server, which<br/>amplifies and distributes their information across<br/>longer distances.')
('Quatre', "If two terminals are close enough, however, it's more<br/>efficient to communicate directly with each other<br/>than to use the server as a middle-man.")
('Agnès', 'I see... So the terminals switch signals, based<br/>on distance?')
('Quatre', 'Yes. There are two different signals terminals will use,<br/>and they switch between the two on the fly<br/>for convenience.')
('Quatre', 'And because I can see this transmission came from a<br/>server, I know that the scammer was some<br/>distance away.')
('Quatre', "This server gives us a general idea of where the<br/>scammer was at the time...but of course, there's no<br/>guarantee they're still there.")
('Quatre', "That's where we are at this point.")
('Van', 'So we have a range, but no specifics. Not enough to<br/>sniff the guy out.')
('Van', "But you sound like you've got somethin' else up<br/>your sleeve.")
('Quatre', 'I might.')
('Quatre', "Just going off his history, that's as close as I can get it.<br/>But of course, we can always just contact the<br/>scammer again.")
('Quatre', "And if we can get a direct link to the scammer's<br/>terminal, we'll know we're close by.")
('Van', "So we call 'em back and figure out where their signal<br/>is comin' from?")
('Quatre', 'Yes. Just, they would need to be in direct signal range<br/>in order for us to pinpoint them.')
('Quatre', 'I can see that the previous message came from the<br/>Riverside server.')
('Quatre', "Let's head there first. The subway station should do<br/>as a starting point.")
('Van', "All right, gang. Let's go hunt down a fraudster.<br/>We'll keep you posted on what we find, 'kay?")
('Van', "We'll use that note terminal you've got there.<br/>Once we find the guy, you're gonna wanna haul ass<br/>over there.")
('Oslo', 'Of course. Thank you so much!')
('System', 'Quest Orbal Net Fraud started!')
('Manager Mohra', "Daphne and Lulua? Yes, they're regulars here.")
('Manager Mohra', 'They dropped by earlier this afternoon, right on time.')
('Van', 'Hah. Bingo.')
('Van', 'You aware of their relationship, by chance?')
('Manager Mohra', 'Sure. I just met Lulua recently.')
('Manager Mohra', 'I heard she volunteers for this assisted living<br/>nonprofit in her spare time.')
('Manager Mohra', 'She gets assigned to help out the elderly and disabled<br/>with stuff like shopping, that sort of thing.')
('Manager Mohra', "Daphne doesn't have any relatives, so Lulua is a big<br/>help for her.")
('Van', "Got'cha...")
('Van', "What I heard, though, is that this Daphne lady ain't<br/>exactly hurtin' for money.")
('Van', "So why'd she look for a free helper instead of a maid<br/>or somethin'?")
('Manager Mohra', "You know, Daphne isn't sure herself.")
('Manager Mohra', 'I recall she said she wanted to pay Lulua<br/>directly, actually.')
('Manager Mohra', "Lulua's told me that she gets some payment from the<br/>agency anyway, though—she's telling Daphne not to<br/>worry about it.")
('Manager Mohra', "That just...really confuses me. She's a volunteer, but<br/>she gets paid for helping Daphne. It's an awfully<br/>roundabout way of doing things.")
('Manager Mohra', 'It just seems like a bit of a contradiction, no?')
('Van', 'Kinda, yeah.')
('Van', "(So this ain't a case of the old lady getting swindled,<br/>at least.)")
('Van', "(But yeah, something's weird here. There's gotta be<br/>some reason she's gettin' paid in that<br/>roundabout way.)")
('Van', 'So, anyway, those two came by earlier, right?')
('Van', 'Any idea where they headed after that?')
('Manager Mohra', 'I recall Lulua said something about showing Daphne<br/>the place where she works.')
('Manager Mohra', 'I think she works at that concert hall in Riverside.')
('Van', "The Riverside Concert Hall? That'd be the Blue<br/>Score, then.")
('Van', 'Thanks much. I owe you one.')
('Manager Mohra', 'Oh, think nothing of it. Stop by again sometime,<br/>will you?')
('Giordano', "Oh! Well, if it isn't a big boy with a cute girl hugging<br/>his arm.")
('Giordano', "Never thought you'd ask me about that name<br/>and notebook. Wonders never cease, huh?")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Ah!')
('Van', 'Looks like we found our guy.')
('Van', "So word is you were scratchin' Dingo's back every<br/>now and then?")
('Giordano', 'Yep. I may not look it, but I used to run all over the<br/>Republic taking odd jobs on the down-low.')
('Giordano', "I was on this smuggling run once, and bam, I bumped<br/>right into him. That's how we met.")
('Giordano', "That must've been...oh, ten years ago?<br/>Dingo would've been around twenty, I think.")
('Van', 'All right.')
('Van', 'So do you know how he got tangled up with Almata<br/>back then, too?')
('Giordano', 'Oh, my boy, do I ever.')
('Giordano', 'That was what led him to ask me for help out of the<br/>city that day. I snuck him out just like that.')
('Giordano', 'He hopped on a bus for Creil, and...that was the last I<br/>saw of him.')
('Giordano', "In retrospect, I shouldn't have done it. I shouldn't<br/>have let his dumb ass do that...")
('Feri', '...')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', '...')
('Agnès', "It wasn't your fault, Giordano.")
('Aaron', "Don't beat yourself up over it. You weren't the one<br/>who killed him. It was Almata... Not even.<br/>Dantès owned that, the shitheel.")
('Giordano', "You're right, yeah... I heard he got what was coming<br/>to him at the old capital.")
('Giordano', "I bet Dingo's laughin' up there. I'm happy karma<br/>came around for the bastard.")
('Giordano', "I hope it makes him feel better. He really regretted<br/>being the guy's broker in his past.")
('Giordano', "Dantès really wasn't the same guy once he took over.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', '...!')
('Van', "So that's his background, huh?")
('Giordano', 'Not trying to justify him, but Dantès used to have a<br/>good rep on the streets. He had a code and he stuck<br/>to it, and that let people trust him.')
('Giordano', 'No wonder he ended up so popular, with how much<br/>everybody hated the head honcho before him. He got<br/>Dingo hook, line, and sinker.')
('Giordano', 'Dingo was his informant. Fed him the info he needed<br/>to bring the old guy down...and now in its stead, we<br/>have this monster he built.')
('Van', '...')
('Judith', 'A monster, huh?')
('Risette', 'A monster, you say?')
('Quatre', 'A monster...?')
('Bergard', '...A fitting title for him.')
('Quatre', 'I suppose that fits him.')
('Risette', 'That does fit him well.')
('Giordano', "I'm not too privy to what happened beyond that, so I<br/>don't wanna speculate.")
('Giordano', "So you're looking for Dingo's old notebook, and you<br/>think I've got it?")
('Van', 'Bingo.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Please! May I please have it?')
('Giordano', "Well...I'd love to give it to you, but I'm afraid I can't.")
('Agnès', 'Why not? Is there something he wanted done first?')
('Aaron', 'What? Pretty boy say it was for your eyes only?')
('Giordano', 'Well, he told me to keep an eye out for this spriggan<br/>guy and a newbie reporter.')
('Giordano', 'If anything happened to him, he wanted me to give<br/>this here key to whichever of you two I bump<br/>into first.')
('System', 'Obtained Coin Locker Key.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Oh.')
('Feri', 'So, what is this key for?')
('Van', "Looks like a key for a station coin locker, like you'd<br/>see around the subway.")
('Giordano', 'Spot on. He said he stashed it in the easiest locker he<br/>could find.')
('Giordano', "I'm not sure what he meant by that, though. I have no<br/>idea which station it's at.")
('Van', 'Got it.')
('Agnès', "The 'easiest locker he could find'... Where would<br/>that be?")
('Aaron', 'Well, that about gives it away.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Hmm... Oh, could it be the one by Van's office?")
('Van', "Probably. Let's head on back and take a look.")
('Van', "Thanks a bunch, Giordano. Maybe I'll make it up to<br/>you with a joy ride one of these days...when I feel<br/>like it.")
('Giordano', "Haha! You just call me anytime you're plastered and<br/>I'll be your DD.")
('Feri', 'Oh! That car there has a checker pattern!')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "That's gotta be it! That's the taxi!")
('Aaron', "The driver's gotta be close. Let's sniff him out.")
('Van', "'Where three pillars stand and you can hear the<br/>rushing water.'")
('Van', "Well, that's my best guess. The hotel has those three<br/>pillars on the logo.")
('Van', 'Wonder what they got in store this time.')
('Rumsfeld', "Welcome to the Maserati Hotel... We've been<br/>expecting you.")
('Van', 'Oh. Hey, Rumsfeld.')
('Van', "You been waitin' for me? Guess that means you got<br/>tied up in this thing, too.")
('Rumsfeld', 'Haha. Indeed, I did.')
('Rumsfeld', "But first, why not sit down and relax? Surely all this<br/>'adventuring' has made you rather tired.")
('Rumsfeld', 'Feel free to unwind while we prepare the<br/>grand finale.')
('Van', "...Well, what's that supposed to mean?")
('Van', "Guess there's no point gettin' all worked up about it.")
('Rumsfeld', 'Thank you for your patience, Mr. Arkride.')
('Rumsfeld', 'And three cheers for your efforts!')
('Van', 'I... Wait... Wha...?')
('Van', 'WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?!')
('Rumsfeld', "It's our reward for your tireless work, Mr. Arkride.<br/>Bon appétit!")
('Van', 'Guh! Seriously, though?!')
('Van', "I... Aidios, did I die the other day? Am I in heaven?<br/>There's this mountain of sweets and...and it's<br/>all MINE!")
('Rumsfeld', "Haha! Oh, it's so wonderful to see you delighted.<br/>It's the least we could have done, truly!")
('Van', '...Ahem. Okay, hold the phone for a sec.')
('Van', "Without even getting into how the hell I'm gonna eat<br/>all this without gainin' a billion curim...")
('Van', "...what's the catch here?")
('Van', "Not sayin' I don't trust you, but I kinda don't<br/>trust you. It's too good to be true...too NICE.<br/>The hell're you gettin' at?")
('Berzelia', "Nothing, Mr. Arkride. Don't be so presumptuous!")
('Van', 'Wait, you?!')
('Van', 'I... You drag the whole damn CITY in here for this?!')
('Van', "And man, why the hell do I know all of you?<br/>What's goin' on?!")
('Berzelia', 'Oh, that flustered look on your face is just too cute.<br/>Well worth the effort of gathering everyone here!')
('Berzelia', 'Are the pieces coming together now? Why all these<br/>friends and acquaintances of yours are here?')
('Van', 'I... No?')
('Van', "I mean, I already got your money, you really don't<br/>need to pay me back for anything.")
('Roderick', 'Ah, but we do.')
('Roderick', "We all wanted to get together to show our<br/>appreciation to you—the hardworking spriggan who's<br/>helped us all through this wild year.")
('Van', "I mean, that's literally just my job. I don't get it.")
('Van', "You're my clients, and I'm your spriggan. That's all<br/>there is to it, really.")
('Doctor Isabelle', 'Oh, read the room, you doofus. This is a more<br/>personal way of thanking you!')
('Rumsfeld', 'Our thanks transcend mira, my boy. This, we felt,<br/>was the best way to show our gratitude.')
('Eddy', 'We owe it mostly to Berzelia, though, she did all the<br/>heavy lifting.')
('Lulua', 'We thought this might make you happy—and it<br/>made US happy to give back to you.')
('Seyla', "We didn't bungle it, did we...?")
('Van', '*sigh* You people are impossible.')
('Van', 'But, uhh...thanks. Heh. What a day.')
('Berzelia', "Aww, he likes it! Heehee. I'm happy to see that.")
('Berzelia', "Well, without further ado, let's bring out his presents!")
('System', 'Van and his clients reminisced over tea, his diligence<br/>and leadership vivid in their minds.')
('System', "One by one, familiar faces walked up to the<br/>spriggan's seat.")
('Lott', 'So, uh... Do you remember us, Van?')
('Lott', 'You helped us out with the register issue at<br/>our work.')
('Daniel', "Hey, don't go blurting that out loud!")
('Daniel', 'E-Er, anyway. I gave it all back after that... You really<br/>saved me there.')
('Lott', 'We heard you have a sweet tooth, so we got you some<br/>cream puffs.')
('Lott', 'We made sure to get plenty. Hope you like them!')
('Alicia', "So, umm! Ever since you got my wallet back, I<br/>haven't lost it again!")
('Jessica', "You've really given me peace of mind. I can live my<br/>life again!")
('Jessica', 'Thank you so much, again, for saving me from<br/>that stalker.')
('Van', 'Sure thing.')
('Doctor Isabelle', "Oh, I'm not here to pay anything off, I'm just here<br/>because it sounded fun.")
('Doctor Isabelle', "You like acting all jaded and glum, but there's this<br/>softie side that always shines through. You're having<br/>fun, aren't you?")
('Van', "Zip it. I didn't ask to have fun!")
('Roderick', 'Thanks again for helping with that pendant.')
('Roderick', "If it wasn't for you and your group, I never would've<br/>gotten to know Bruno like that.")
('Roderick', 'As thanks, I brought you some engadin from Basel.')
('Roderick', "It's already here on the table, so I hope you like it.")
('Van', 'Engadin?! Damn... You know your sweets, huh?')
('Van', "Honestly wasn't expectin' you to show up in the<br/>first place.")
('Bruno', "Hmph. I hadn't been planning on it, honestly...")
('Bruno', "...but SOME-body wouldn't stop nagging me<br/>about it.")
('Roderick', 'Heh heh.')
('Amy', 'Do you still remember, when I had you look for<br/>my boyfriend?')
('Amy', "I'm happy I was able to finally get closure. I hope<br/>Mark did, too.")
('Amy', 'So, I went and got you a chocolate cream pie. Share it<br/>with all the others at your office, will you?')
('Percy', 'Thanks for helping us test out our little puzzle game!')
('Percy', "As thanks, we'd like to give you some gum we're<br/>planning to give out as a game reward. This one's a<br/>trial run, just for you!")
('Percy', 'Come join in the fun again sometime!')
('Van', 'Sure, if I feel like it.')
('Oslo', "You taught me a lot about security on the orbal net.<br/>I've been a lot more careful since you helped me out.")
('Van', "Well, that's good. Glad to hear you're keepin' safe.")
('Lulua', 'Heehee. You really helped us out back there.')
('Seyla', "Yeah, I don't even want to think about what would've<br/>happened if you hadn't taken that request.")
('Seyla', "We're still here thanks to you.")
('Lulua', "So here's some homemade chocolate for you!<br/>We poured our all into this.")
('Lulua', 'The real big one is for you, and the rest are for the<br/>other people at your office!')
('Seyla', 'Make sure to share with them, okay?')
('Van', "Of course, I'm not THAT greedy. C'mon, heh.")
('Van', "Thanks. I'll dig in later.")
('Stephan', 'Umm, thanks for helping my dad!')
('Walton', "Thanks to you and my son, I've cut ties with that<br/>awful place for good.")
('Curtis', 'So, we got you a cheesecake as thanks.')
('Curtis', 'Thank you, again, for helping out this afternoon.')
('Curtis', "We've still got a lot of stuff to work out, but we're<br/>moving in the right direction now.")
('Isla', "It's all thanks to you I was able to see<br/>my grandmother...")
('Isla', 'I just want to thank you again.')
('Isla', 'I got you a famous financier cake from Anchorville.<br/>Please enjoy it.')
('Van', "Oh, wow. Now you've piqued my interest.")
('Van', "But honestly, I didn't do that much. A whole cake for<br/>some spriggan like me?")
('Berzelia', "Right, I believe we're last up.")
('Berzelia', 'I apologize for all the trouble. You really did save<br/>me there... Thank you ever so much.')
('Eddy', 'And, uh...me, too. Thanks.')
('Rumsfeld', 'And allow me to extend my heartfelt gratitude<br/>once more.')
('Rumsfeld', 'I dread to imagine what might have befallen the<br/>young miss had you not helped.')
('Van', "Okay, okay, I'm grateful. Dunno where the hell I'll<br/>store all this, though—my fridge ain't THAT big.")
('Berzelia', "Heehee! Well, you'll just have to get to eating, then.")
('Berzelia', 'Honestly, though, lighten up! You keep trying to<br/>brush off all this thanks and appreciation, but...why?')
('Eddy', "Yeah. You're too old to be an edgelord, man.")
('Van', 'Said the wannabe gangster.')
('Rumsfeld', "Ah, youth... Haha. Oh, on the subject, the young<br/>miss' father wished to thank you as well.")
('Rumsfeld', 'He has more in store for you than just the<br/>Trion Tower hot spring ticket.')
('Rumsfeld', "He would like to invite you and all of Arkride<br/>Solutions to a gourmet dinner at the Maserati<br/>Hotel's restaurant.")
('Van', "Wait, seriously? That's a real bougie place, isn't it?")
('Van', "Shit, I can't turn that down, though. I've heard<br/>LEGENDS about that seasonal fruit cake.")
('Berzelia', "Wonderful! I'm sure Father will be happy to<br/>hear that.")
('Van', "Honestly, I feel kinda bad havin' you guys do all this<br/>for me.")
('Van', 'But, uhh...thanks.')
('Van', 'All right, all right, I get it. You got the point across.')
('Eddy', 'Man, just let us thank you, you old grump.')
('Berzelia', 'Heehee...!')
('System', "And so, the surprise 'Van Appreciation Day' party<br/>continued in earnest.")
('System', "All the sweets he couldn't get around to sweeting got<br/>carted off to the office.")
('System', 'Eventually, the party drew to a close after Van<br/>mingled with his clients and friends—and thoroughly<br/>gorged himself.')
('System', "But the day wasn't over just yet. Van met a familiar<br/>face as he left the hotel...")
('Van', "Goddess almighty, why'd they have to gang up on me<br/>like that? That's not right. I'm...allergic to kindness.")
('Van', "And yeesh, I'm stuffed. Gonna have to hit the gym,<br/>feels like.")
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', 'Heh. Sounds like a good problem to have.')
('Van', "Maybe, but it ain't my style.")
('Van', 'Big buncha softies, is what they were.')
('Van', '(Kinda funny, honestly: I always see the dark side of<br/>humanity in my line of work...)')
('Van', "(...but this was the opposite. Ain't got a clue how I<br/>stumbled into somethin' selfless like that.)")
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', "Really? Who's the true softie: the clients, or the<br/>spriggan who went above and beyond to give them<br/>peace of mind?")
('Van', 'Oh, shut up.')
('Van', "And somethin' tells me that whole thing was your<br/>doing, anyway. Am I wrong?")
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', 'Hah. Right again.')
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', "Though the 'young miss' came up with the idea,<br/>in fairness.")
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', 'She wanted to show her thanks, so she asked her<br/>butler to do the rounds.')
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', "He found this young businessman—you might know<br/>him, name's Roderick. And his face lit up like a<br/>match when he heard your name.")
('Van', 'Heh... Yeah, I guess we did hit it off a bit.')
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', "That led them to me, as I'd already done some<br/>research into you on Berzelia's behalf.")
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', "I figured I'd lend a hand as thanks for how you<br/>helped Dingo.")
('Van', "Ah, that was nothin'...")
('Van', "...wait, back up a bit. What do you mean you 'did<br/>some digging'?")
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', "Exactly what it sounds like, pardon my nosiness.<br/>You're an interesting fellow, y'know?")
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', "Dingo told me a thing or two about you, and I can't<br/>deny it got me curious.")
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', "Might make for a good article: 'Arkride the<br/>Antihero—Not the Man Edith Deserves, but the<br/>Man Edith Needs'...")
('Van', "Well, how'm I supposed to keep a low profile if you<br/>slap my face on the front page?")
('Van', 'I was wondering how that kid got all those<br/>guys together... That was the trick, huh?')
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', 'Right-o.')
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', "I gotta hand it to her, I didn't think we'd be able to<br/>put on that big a party on such short notice.")
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', "She even roped the department store and that<br/>mechanic's place in, too. She's something else.")
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', "And it all worked to perfection: a big ol' party with<br/>enough sugar to put you in a coma.")
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', 'Come to think of it, that would make for a great<br/>article, too. I can see it now...')
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', "Hah, I got it. 'An Antihero's Welcome: Arkride<br/>Sheds Tears at Touching Tribute.'")
('Van', "Would you knock it off with the antihero shit? And I<br/>was NOT cryin'.")
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', "Whatever you say. If you don't mind, I'll be keeping<br/>track of your exploits from here on out.")
('Van', 'Hey, give a man a break, will ya?')
('Van', "(I'll have to keep an eye out for him, too...)")
('Van', "...Well, guess a journo's gotta eat.")
('System', 'Quest Dear Spriggan completed!')
('System', 'Received')
('Carol', 'Oh, are you here from that office place?')
('Van', 'Yep. Van Arkride, Arkride Solutions.')
('Van', 'Your little brother asked me to find Jess.')
('Van', 'Mind talking about it? Any little thing might help.')
('Carol', 'But I, umm...')
('Van', "I already heard somethin' happened between you<br/>and Jess.")
('Van', "If you don't want to, you don't have to tell me the full<br/>story—just anything that might help me find him.")
('Van', "Raymond's been real worried about him, y'know.")
('Van', "Poor guy took a day off of work, he's runnin' around<br/>the whole city tryna find him.")
('Van', 'I think it took a lot for him to reach out for help, too.')
('Agnès', 'So, please, for his sake.')
('Feri', 'Please help us find him!')
('Aaron', "So, help us out? For your li'l bro.")
('Risette', 'Your brother would be thankful for your help.')
('Quatre', 'Raymond would appreciate it.')
('Judith', 'So, could you help us out? For his sake.')
('Bergard', "It would put your brother's mind at ease.")
('Carol', 'I know, I just...')
('Carol', "Raymond isn't the only one worried about him.")
('Carol', "I can't tell you everything, but I can try to help as best<br/>I can.")
('Van', 'No problem. Every little bit helps.')
('Van', 'So, three days ago, we heard Jess canceled his<br/>upcoming live performance last minute.')
('Van', 'You know why?')
('Carol', "Well, it was... Oh, I can't hide it. It's all my fault...!")
('Van', 'I see...')
('Carol', 'I was talking to him right before he was set<br/>to perform.')
('Carol', 'I sorta asked how he viewed me, how he wanted us to<br/>be going forward... I was trying to make a move.')
('Carol', "Jess was saying, 'I'm fine if you're fine.' 'I don't wanna<br/>rock the boat.' Stuff like that.")
('Carol', "He didn't have a problem with how things were.")
('Carol', "But I... I didn't react well to that. I lashed out at him.")
('Carol', "'I don't wanna be like this forever, though.'")
('Carol', 'I could tell I hurt Jess when I said that... He was<br/>silent for a minute.')
('Carol', "Then he said, 'I can't risk that. I don't wanna ruin<br/>what we have already.'")
('Carol', "'You don't understand how I feel—or Raymond.'")
('Carol', 'He sounded really...strained...')
('Carol', 'But... But I DID understand. I know how he feels...!')
('Carol', "And I can't just have my own feelings bottled up like<br/>this...!")
('Carol', 'I just... And then Jess, he... *sniffle*')
('Van', "I get the gist. Thanks for fillin' us in.")
('Carol', "I'm sorry. I just don't know what to say...")
('Carol', "I just can't face him right now—not after what I did.")
('Van', "I get that. We'll take care of it, don't worry.")
('Van', "(I think I understand what's goin' on between her<br/>and Jess.)")
('Van', '(Jess was just... Yeah.)')
('Van', "(Carol must've picked up on it.)")
('Van', "(It's just the Raymond part I'm not clear on.<br/>What about his feelings...?)")
('Van', "By the way, you're in contact with Jess'<br/>manager, right?")
('Van', "Mind givin' me their number?")
('Carol', 'Oh, yes, of course.')
('System', 'Van plugged in the contact info Carol gave him and<br/>immediately dialed it up.')
('System', "He got through to Jess' manager, who agreed to meet<br/>him at the terrace in front of the station.")
('Van', "Got'cha. Let's get on over there.")
('Van', "All right, let's get over there.")
('Agnès', "The terrace by the station, right? Let's go.")
('Feri', 'Roger. I know where that is!')
('Aaron', "Easy enough. Let's get a move on.")
('Risette', 'Right. Our destination is the station terrace.')
('Quatre', 'All right. That sounds simple enough.')
('Judith', "Got it. Let's get going to that terrace.")
('Bergard', 'That sounds good. To the terrace, yes?')
('Feri', "We're here. This is the Seiden District.")
('Feri', '(I got a little lost and took the long way<br/>around, though.)')
(40302, '*sniff* Whoa, what is THAT? It smells delicious!')
(40301, 'Ah! Hey! Stop running off!')
('Feri', "Wait, that's not the way to the police station!")
(40303, 'Hmm? Where are you going at this hour, young lady?')
(40303, "It's a little late for children to be running<br/>around alone.")
(40302, 'Eep!')
(40303, 'Hey!')
('Feri', "Oh, don't worry about us!")
('Feri', "I'm just taking these lost kids to the police station.")
(40303, "...Huh. All right, then. Just don't get lost, okay?<br/>I'm heading on home myself.")
(40302, 'Whoa!')
(40301, "Hey, you're too fast!")
('Feri', "I'm just glad he didn't cause any trouble.")
('Feri', 'This street goes to the police station, so just stick with<br/>me, okay?')
(40301, 'Okay!')
('Van', "Yeesh. Had me sweatin' for a sec.")
('Van', "Wait, what are they doin'? That's the wrong way.")
(40304, "Huh? What're kids doing out here this late?")
(40305, 'We were just getting the party started. You brats<br/>trying to spoil our fun?')
(40302, "Mmm... I'm scared...")
(40301, 'H-Help me...!')
('Feri', '(This is just a mess tonight...)')
('Feri', "Look, we're not up to anything.")
('Feri', "We're just passing by, so could you please let<br/>us through?")
(40305, "What wuzzat? Don't you get uppity with us, brat.")
(40304, 'You want through, huh? Well, sorry, kid. You gotta<br/>pay the toll, see?')
(40305, "Us poor boys gotta eat. Inflation really hit us<br/>hard, y'know?")
('Feri', 'Huh? Why should I pay you mira?')
('Feri', 'Do you not have jobs? There are plenty of places you<br/>could work to get some money.')
(40304, 'Say that again? Little punk-ass bitch, you wanna go?!')
(40305, 'Spoiled rotten. Never got taught to respect her elders.')
(40304, "Well, let's give her a li'l lesson, then! She'll pay<br/>in teeth!")
(40302, 'Eep!')
(40301, 'Oh, no!')
(40305, 'YEOWCH?!')
(40304, 'A... A coin?!')
('Feri', '...!')
(40304, 'OW, OW, OW! What the shit?!')
(40304, 'How can a little girl hit that hard...?!')
('Feri', 'Do you still wanna fight?')
('Feri', 'Or do you just wanna come with me to the<br/>police station?')
(40305, "N-No, ma'am! We're good!")
(40304, "We, uh... We'll start workin' tomorrow! Yeah!<br/>Workin' real hard!")
('Feri', 'Are you okay?')
(40301, 'Holy COW! You beat them up in a flash!')
(40302, "You're so cool! I wanna be strong like that when I<br/>grow up!")
('Feri', 'Oh, that was nothing, heehee. I had some help<br/>there, too.')
('Van', "Oh, I was just makin' sure you didn't kill 'em, heh.")
('Van', "The precinct's just over there. Don't want to keep<br/>your parents waiting, right?")
('System', 'They arrived at the station to find the parents waiting<br/>for them. They scooped up the kids with open arms,<br/>relief washing across their faces.')
('System', 'Feri and Van were showered in thank-yous before<br/>they made their way out.')
('Feri', 'Thanks for that, Van.')
('Feri', "You told the parents to come to the station,<br/>didn't you?")
('Van', "Huh? Dunno what you're talkin' about there, sorry.<br/>Heh.")
('Van', "How 'bout you, though? Never pegged you as the<br/>type to take initiative like that.")
('Van', "You could've just left it to the adults, but nope.<br/>You really took the reins there.")
('Feri', "Heehee. They kinda reminded me of my own<br/>siblings, so I just couldn't leave them alone.")
('Van', "Oh, yeah. I remember you sayin' something<br/>about that. You got a brother and sister, right?")
('Van', "You did kinda give off big sis vibes, the way you were<br/>helpin' 'em.")
('Feri', "H-Hey, that's embarrassing, heehee.")
('Feri', "I AM a big sister, though. My little sister's ten, and<br/>my little brother's eight.")
('Van', "Whew. Your mom and pop got busy. Must be hectic<br/>growin' up in a tribe like that.")
('Feri', "Yeah. Being one of the older children, I would help<br/>Umi around the house, and I'd look after the other<br/>kids, too.")
('Feri', "They'd sneak in combat training whenever I got<br/>the time. And sometimes, I would sneak a peek at<br/>tribal meetings!")
('Feri', "It was pretty crazy, looking back on it. I didn't get<br/>much time to rest because I was always training and<br/>helping out.")
('Feri', "N-Not to say this job is easy! I'm not slacking,<br/>I promise! I'm giving this job my all, just like<br/>my training!")
('Van', "Heh heh. Hey, don't worry about it. I know you are.")
('Van', "How'd the little ones take it when you left? They cry<br/>when ol' reliable had to leave the nest?")
('Feri', 'Well, uh... Yeah, haha.')
('Feri', 'My older brother left a few years ago himself.<br/>He only comes back to visit once a year.')
('Feri', "He's all by himself out there now.")
('Van', '...Huh.')
('Feri', "I wanna grow up to be like him...so I feel like that's<br/>something I gotta do, too.")
('Feri', "That's what I told my younger siblings when I left.")
('Feri', "But honestly, I still don't know why we need to do<br/>this—or why my brother needed to, anyway.")
('Feri', "He could've lent that strength to the tribe and helped<br/>us all grow back home.")
('Van', 'So you never heard why he left?')
('Feri', 'No, but I think Abi knows. He gave him permission<br/>to leave.')
('Feri', 'I just wish he would tell me...')
('Van', 'I see...')
('Feri', "Well...maybe he has his reasons. And maybe when<br/>I'm all grown up, he can tell me. Heehee.")
('Feri', "I've got a long way to go before I can call myself a<br/>warrior, anyway.")
('Feri', "So that's my goal: I'm gonna grow strong enough for<br/>Abi and my brother to accept me as a real warrior!")
('Van', "That's the spirit!")
('Van', "(Heh. She's more responsible than I gave her<br/>credit for. Felt like I'd have to babysit her at the start,<br/>but nope.)")
('Feri', 'Huh? Something wrong, Van?')
('Van', "Oh. Nah, it's nothin'.")
('Van', 'Anyway, I got these meat buns from the Eastern<br/>restaurant over by Tyrell. Want some?')
('Feri', "What? How'd you know I was so hungry?! I'd<br/>love some!")
('System', "Those meat buns didn't last long. Van and Feri<br/>quickly resumed their patrol, bellies appeased.")
('System', 'Van quickly dealt with the paperwork Risette<br/>had provided.')
('System', 'He packed it up and made for the Seiden District<br/>police station.')
('Van', "Man, I can't believe I spaced on this. I completely<br/>forgot today was the cutoff.")
('Van', "Right, this whole 'customization form' thing...<br/>They just rolled that out, if I recall?")
('Risette', "Correct. The government is inspecting customized<br/>automobiles to ensure they're not hazardous to<br/>public safety.")
('Risette', 'Failing to submit this form will void your tax<br/>exemption and other credits. Your car will effectively<br/>be illegal.')
('Risette', 'Smaller customizations can use a separate form from<br/>this one.')
('Van', "Yeah, this one's probably their way of preparing for<br/>like, engine swaps and lift kits and shit.")
('Van', "I got the paperwork a while ago, but I kept puttin'<br/>it off. Looked like a pain in the ass.")
('Van', 'You really saved my bacon, getting this stuff sorted<br/>for me.')
('Risette', 'Of course. These clerical affairs are my forte.')
('Risette', 'Shall we get this dealt with, then?')
('Van', 'Ah, crap.')
('Inspector Daswani', 'Hmph. Fancy meeting you here.')
('Van', "Ain't 'cause I wanna be here, trust me.")
('Detective Nate', 'Oho! Finally decided to come clean, huh?<br/>About damn time.')
('Van', "Come clean for what, jackass? I'm just here to turn in<br/>some papers for my truck mods.")
('Inspector Daswani', 'Huh, I saw that young lady with you in Tharbad.')
('Risette', "Thank you for your help back then. My name is<br/>Risette Twinings—I'm a concierge for the<br/>Marduk Company.")
('Risette', "I'm currently assisting Mr. Arkride on<br/>official business.")
('Detective Nate', 'Official—?! How do you keep fumbling your way into<br/>a harem, dick?!')
('Inspector Daswani', 'Marduk, huh...?')
('Inspector Daswani', "Hey, you mind if I pull you aside for some<br/>questions, miss? I'll take care of the paperwork<br/>for you.")
('Van', 'Ugh... Thought they were never gonna let us go.')
('Van', 'You have any idea they were gonna do that to you<br/>when you got to the precinct?')
('Risette', 'I did know they wanted to question me. I figured that<br/>I might as well accompany you and get it over<br/>with there.')
('Risette', "But that's neither here nor there. Good work getting<br/>your form filled out—that's most of your paperwork<br/>done for today.")
('Van', "Thanks... Wait, 'most'? What's next?")
('Risette', 'Oh, nothing major, just your taxes. Heehee.')
('Risette', "And while we're at it, I did want to run some<br/>equipment maintenance and office resupplies by you.")
('Van', "Man, I almost feel bad, puttin' you to work this hard<br/>after you just joined... Almost.")
('Van', "Let's go ahead and tackle all that while we're at it.")
('Risette', 'Perfect. Our next destination is Station Street, then.')
('System', 'Van accompanied Risette as they navigated their<br/>busywork for the day.')
('System', 'After a round of shopping on Station Street, they<br/>took a little break at a nearby café.')
('Van', "Huh. You goin' solo?")
('Kincaid', 'What, were you expecting a swarm of VIPs like with<br/>the afterparty?')
('Van', "No, obviously. I just didn't know if Elaine set<br/>somethin' up again or what.")
('Van', 'On the topic, she suggested the venue, right?')
('Kincaid', 'She did, yes. This place was her<br/>recommendation, too.')
('Van', 'Huh.')
('Kincaid', "...What? She knows her way around town.<br/>There's nothing odd about that.")
('Van', "I know, that's not what I mean. Just, she's still upset,<br/>isn't she?")
('Kincaid', 'Of course she is, after all these years.')
('Van', "Man, you've always been like this. You never miss a<br/>beat when it comes to anything.")
('Kincaid', "I try. It's not easy keeping everything in balance, but<br/>the reward is well worth it.")
('Kincaid', "...That said, it's not exactly a good look for me to<br/>attend a social function sans a partner.")
('Van', "Well, I'm sure that all fits into your master<br/>plan somehow. Heh.")
('Van', 'Gotta scheme your way to the top in this world, and a<br/>certain four-eyed demon knows that all too well.')
('Kincaid', "Oh, I'm far from done. The road ahead is longer than<br/>the road behind...")
('Kincaid', '...especially when I consider what—or WHO—lies at<br/>the end of that road.')
('Van', "...Damn, you got me shakin' in my boots with that<br/>grin of yours. You almost look like some kinda movie<br/>villain, there.")
('Kincaid', "Please, I'm not that conniving. I'm just shrewd.")
('Kincaid', "She's a good person, truly. I mean, I should know.")
('Van', 'Would you? You were always buried in books and<br/>poring over current events. Elaine and I were<br/>nowhere near as boring.')
('Van', "Unlike a certain four-eyes, you'd never find US filing<br/>paperwork on our lunch breaks.")
('Kincaid', 'Ha. No, you two were too busy tripping over<br/>yourselves and averting your gazes.')
('Kincaid', "Your little will-they-won't-they routine was top<br/>entertainment, you know. Every student, every<br/>teacher, we all ate it up.")
('Van', "No shit? First I've heard of that.")
('Kincaid', 'Really? You two were the single most popular couple<br/>in the entire school.')
('Kincaid', 'I even lent you a hand from time to time—Elaine had<br/>plenty of suitors, but I kept them well clear of her.')
('Van', "...You tellin' me I had a wingman the entire<br/>damn time?!")
('Kincaid', 'Ah, that reminds me... We never did make good on<br/>our old promise, did we?')
('Van', 'What promi—oh, right. That.')
('Kincaid', 'The basketball club, back when a certain super-sub<br/>would come trundling in to fill gaps on the team...')
('Kincaid', 'We were in plenty of matches together, but we never<br/>did get the chance to face off against each<br/>other one-on-one.')
('Van', 'So I told you we could square off in that intramural<br/>tournament before we graduated. Now I remember...')
('Van', "...Yeah, I kinda broke that, didn't I?")
('Kincaid', "You can't bellyache your way out of this one like some<br/>old dodder. We WILL have our match.")
('Van', "Heh. Back at'cha.")
('Van', 'All that desk work wreck your eyes?')
('Kincaid', "I believe I showed you this afternoon how athletic I<br/>still am. Let's finish this.")
('System', 'Van and Kincaid took to the basketball court for a<br/>one-on-one showdown years in the making.')
('System', 'And as the memories of their high school days came<br/>rushing back, their friendly rivalry started to get a<br/>little...un-friendly.')
('System', 'Their no-holds-barred match drew a crowd of ballers<br/>and neighbors from all around, marveling at what<br/>they saw.')
('System', 'The seconds wound down, the buzzer at the ready...')
(40301, 'Yooo! He hit that from the PARKING LOT!')
(40302, "The nerd beat him! I can't believe it!")
(40303, 'But man, that blue-haired dude could really<br/>ball, too!')
('Van', "Shit! Nothin' I could do... Wait. When'd the whole<br/>neighborhood get here?")
('Kincaid', "Phew... Hah. I might've gotten a little too into<br/>that one.")
('Van', 'Damn, man. I thought I had a chance there, but you<br/>had me locked down at the end.')
('Kincaid', 'I do still practice on my days off. All that desk work<br/>will wreck my eyes, after all.')
('Kincaid', "You held up pretty well yourself. Perhaps there's<br/>something to be said for the jack of all trades.")
('Van', "Heh... Jack of all trades, master of none's better than<br/>a master of one.")
('Van', "Been a while since anybody called me that—takes me<br/>back to when I'd just join whatever club I could for<br/>spare cash.")
('Van', "Y'know, that ain't too far from the work I do now...<br/>Maybe that's how it started for me.")
('Kincaid', "That line of work suits you well, I'd say.")
('Kincaid', 'In a way, I think school helped us all find our paths<br/>to walk. Elaine the bracer, Van the spriggan...and me.')
('Van', 'Not to sound like a broken record, but...you really<br/>wanna stick your nose in that business, huh?')
('Van', "You're starin' Gehenna in the face, René. You know<br/>that, right?")
('Van', "You don't wanna make Elaine even more worried<br/>than she already is.")
('Kincaid', "I'm well aware, trust me.")
('Kincaid', "And you could stand to take that advice, too.<br/>You've got something self-destructive written on<br/>your face...")
('Kincaid', "'I'm glad we got to see each other one last time.'<br/>'Good note to wrap things up on.'")
('Kincaid', 'Well? Am I wrong?')
('Van', 'Wha—no, I...')
('Kincaid', "I know well what lies ahead—and I know that it<br/>won't be pleasant.")
('Kincaid', "But I'll make sure not to get too detached from<br/>my bonds. I will always cherish our friendship.")
('Kincaid', "Don't you forget your dreams, either...or why so many<br/>people gathered at that bistro to pay you back.<br/>You're special in your own right.")
('Van', "...Pfft. Get a load of the young master here, handin'<br/>out speeches like candy.")
('Van', "But fine. If it helps you sleep at night. I'll<br/>watch myself.")
('Kincaid', "And I'll try not to bore you with my lectures<br/>going forward.")
('Kincaid', 'I think I could use another round or two. Care to<br/>join me?')
('Van', "Now you're speakin' my language.")
('System', 'The old friends made some light-hearted small talk<br/>over one last round of drinks.')
('System', 'And after that, they went their separate ways into<br/>the night.')
('System', "Van's group decided to take a short break.")
('System', 'Everyone split up so they could spend their free time<br/>as they pleased.')
('Van', "Yup, that's luxury—excess express all the way. I don't<br/>think I could handle her...")
('Van', "No, no, resist the temptation, Van. Only got eyes for<br/>Ingert—can you really say you love your car when you<br/>haven't modded the hell out of it?")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Aren't you...?")
('Van', "Hey, look who it is. Bumped into each other in<br/>Langport, too, didn't we? We have a knack for<br/>doin' that.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Well, what timing! I've been looking for you!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Is it true that you and your company had a hand in<br/>resolving that incident?')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "May I ask a few questions, please? I'd like your<br/>account of the events!")
('Van', "Whoa, whoa, okay, slow down. What're we talkin'<br/>about here? You might be mixin' me up.")
('Van', "We booked it back to Edith after you saw us, so I<br/>don't think we had any part in that.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "I have reports that you were at the scene. Don't play<br/>dumb, please!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "We've also heard that you traveled to Creil Village,<br/>shortly before that attack there...")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "There's something about you, something that makes<br/>these incidents pop up wherever you go! There's gotta<br/>be a correlation!")
('Van', "Yeah, no, we weren't even there.<br/>(Man, she's nosy. How the hell does she know...?)")
('Van', 'Oh, shit. Is that Dingo over there?')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Wait, reall—hey! You're not getting me with<br/>that again!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "You're trying to throw me off the scent, just like with<br/>that Maxim scoop.")
('Van', "No, seriously, I swear that's him. And who's that lady<br/>huggin' his arm?")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Are you actually serious?')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'W-Wait...')
('Van', "Hoho. Sly dog. Didn't think he had it in him.")
('Van', "And that's a pretty snazzy hotel they're walkin' into.<br/>What's the scoop there, I wonder?")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', '...')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Just wait a second.')
('Van', "Not sure why you're houndin' me. Shouldn't you be<br/>lookin' into Dingo?")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'I know, I know! I need your help with him!')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "You specialize in investigations, right? You're all, like,<br/>sneaky and stealthy and stuff.")
('Van', "Well, no, I ain't a detective. Why would I just tail a<br/>guy like that?")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Mrrgh...!')
('Van', '*sigh* Fine, I can stalk him.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Grr, what are they saying?! I can barely hear them!')
('Van', 'Hence why I said we should get a bit closer.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Well, then he'd spot us for sure!")
('Van', "From my 'sneaky and stealthy' experience, no, I think<br/>we'd be fine.")
('Dingo', 'Sorry for keeping you like that.')
(40301, "Oh, not a problem. I'm glad we were able to talk this<br/>out some more.")
(40301, "I'll be back, you know!")
('Van', 'Huh?')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "So what the heck were they talking about?<br/>They weren't breaking up, were they? That's not the<br/>vibe I got...")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Grr...')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Whaaa—?!')
('Dingo', 'How long have you two been there?')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'D-Dingo! Umm, well...')
('Van', 'Told you. He knew from the start.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Dingo! Who was that woman just now?!')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Is she your...you know...?!')
('Dingo', "Umm... No? She's a colleague, Marielle.")
('Dingo', "She's on this selection committee for an award body.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Award body?')
('Van', "Oh, don't tell me.")
('Van', 'Somebody got himself a Fulitzer, huh?')
('Dingo', "Well, not quite, but yes, they've been bugging me<br/>about it for a while.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Wait... The FULITZER?! You're in the running for<br/>the highest journalistic award in the land, and you<br/>didn't TELL anybody?!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'What for?! Why are you being so secretive about—')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Gah, my stupid phone! Who could be...<br/>The editor-in-chief?! NOW?!')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Hello...? Okay... Yes... Right, I get that...')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Wha—sir, please! I... Okay, okay... All right. I'll be<br/>there in a bit.")
('Van', "Ouch, heh. They tell you to stop wanderin' around<br/>and start doin' your job?")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Of all the stinking times...!')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "I'm holding you to this, Dingo! You'd better fess up<br/>next time!")
('Van', 'Looks like you got your hands full these days.')
('Dingo', "She's...eccentric. I'll leave it at that.")
('Van', "But damn, nice job on the Fulitzer nod. I had no idea<br/>they were reachin' out to you about that.")
('Van', 'Though now that I think about it, I guess you were<br/>kinda a shoo-in. You were on the ground for the war,<br/>if I recall.')
('Dingo', 'Yup. I remember running into you once or twice—<br/>you were on the Mirage side, but you still lent us a<br/>hand from time to time.')
('Dingo', "I had comms with all of Calvard's media outlets at<br/>the time. The Royal Guardian, the Tyrell Times, you<br/>name it.")
('Dingo', 'I even branched out to some international outlets.<br/>I was chasing the truth behind it all, everything else<br/>be damned.')
('Dingo', 'I put a lot of stuff together from a buncha different<br/>sources, so I guess they wanted to recognize that.')
('Van', "Heard you were up on the front lines when the<br/>fighting broke out, snappin' photos of the battle.")
('Van', "'The Reality of War,' those outlets called it. You were<br/>anonymous at the time, but I had a feeling it was you.<br/>Blew everyone away...")
('Dingo', "That's the thing: it wasn't just me. I can't accept that<br/>award in good faith if it means putting down<br/>everyone else.")
('Dingo', "I'd hoped they'd just leave me be if I kept running<br/>long enough, but nope. Here they are in Edith.")
('Van', "I get that, but c'mon, don't sell yourself short.")
('Van', "You risked your life out there to get those photos.<br/>Somebody's gotta be recognized for that, and it might<br/>as well be you.")
('Van', "Plus you accept that award and it gives you<br/>a platform. You can thank 'em all you want once your<br/>articles start sellin' like hotcakes.")
('Dingo', "...Nah. Still doesn't feel right—and I don't think I'd<br/>be that big.")
('Dingo', "No, ol' Dingo Brad is still a two-bit gossip<br/>rag reporter.")
('Dingo', "That's all I'm ever gonna be, and all I ever wanna be.")
('Van', "I mean...sure, I guess? It's your life, and all.")
('Van', 'You let that whole nihilist bit slip a little when you<br/>watch over that new girl, though. Just a heads-up.')
('Dingo', "That's rich, coming from you.")
('Dingo', "You act all tough, but then you ferry all your<br/>part-timers around like some kinda mother hen.<br/>Big ol' softie.")
('Van', 'Tch.')
('Dingo', "But, well, I guess you've got a point. There's nothing<br/>wrong with training her up as an apprentice.")
('Van', "Pfft. Don't need to give it a cool spin to justify it.")
('Van', "Nothin' wrong with doin' you. Just as long as we<br/>don't make fools of ourselves in front of<br/>the young'uns.")
('Dingo', "Heh. Bud, you're on the right side of 25, you ARE<br/>a young'un. But yeah, we just gotta keep moving<br/>forward, you know?")
('System', 'Van bid Dingo farewell, and returned to his work.')
('System', "Van's group decided to take a short break.")
('System', 'Everyone split up so they could spend their free time<br/>as they pleased.')
('Ashen', 'Nihao, Van!')
('Ashen', "Thanks for coming, heehee. You're okay with giving<br/>me a little tour, right?")
('Ashen', 'So first, I was thinking—')
('Van', "Whoa, pump the brakes a sec. Had a quick question<br/>for you, if you don't mind.")
('Van', "You picked a weird-ass time to visit Edith.<br/>What's the itinerary?")
('Van', "I doubt you're here on your own.")
('Ashen', "Yeah, Bàbà's on a business trip here, so I decided to<br/>tag along.")
('Ashen', "Though I do have some business of my own, if I'm<br/>being honest.")
('Van', 'Right. The sketchy business, if I had to guess?')
('Van', "Doubt your old man's negotiatin' bake sales.")
('Ashen', "Well, you're not wrong.")
('Ashen', "He's got a few of our companies together to figure<br/>out a plan for you-know-who.")
('Ashen', "Cao came along as well, but he's... Well, I'm not sure<br/>where he is, actually.")
('Ashen', 'Real shame, honestly, this was a wonderful chance for<br/>a date.')
('Van', "White Orchid Dragon's up to somethin', huh?<br/>(I don't like the smell of that.)")
('Ashen', 'Well, anyway, I still have a while before the meeting,<br/>so I figured: why not take a walk around?')
('Ashen', "Bàbà's busy getting everything ready with the<br/>attendees, so I have nothing else to do.")
('Ashen', "You know Edith like the back of your hand,<br/>don't you?")
('Van', "I mean, yeah, but can't Aaron do it? Might as well<br/>ask him.")
('Ashen', 'I did! But he canceled out of nowhere, the jerk!')
('Ashen', "He didn't even call me, he TEXTED! Can you<br/>believe that? Just texted me, 'Something came up, go<br/>ask the old man if he'll do it.'")
('Ashen', "He hasn't changed a bit, I swear...")
('Van', '(That little shit...!)')
('Ashen', "C'mon, Van, please? For me?")
('Ashen', "It's been so long since I last visited Edith. There's so<br/>much to see, so many souvenirs to buy!")
('Ashen', "It'll be a favor Heiyue owes you for! C'mon, pleeease?")
('Van', "Heiyue really isn't gonna care about... *sigh*<br/>Okay, fine. I'll show you around a bit.")
('Van', "We'll call it an apology for how that job thing<br/>went down.")
('Ashen', 'Yay! Thanks! ❤')
('Ashen', 'Hey, so which of these do you think would look good<br/>on Cao?')
('Van', "You're really thinkin' about him instead?<br/>Thought this tour was for YOU.")
('Ashen', "Oh, don't be such a killjoy.")
('Ashen', 'Cao and I are in Edith together for the very first time!<br/>This is the perfect chance to deepen our bond!')
('Ashen', "Hmm... Should I pick out a matching piece for<br/>myself, now that I think about it? I think that's a<br/>good idea.")
('Ashen', "I can just hear him now. 'Ah... We match, I see.'")
('Ashen', "And then he'll get all flustered, and... Oooooh!")
('Van', 'Lady, your mind works in strange ways.')
('Ashen', 'Ahh, that was fun! I got to buy a ton of stuff, I got to<br/>see all the sights, everything!')
('Ashen', 'It was really something seeing the tower up close.<br/>It gives the Great Spire a run for its mira!')
('Van', 'Not sure those are really in the same category, but<br/>fair enough.')
('Van', '...')
('Van', '...Hey.')
('Ashen', "Oh, don't worry about them. I'm perfectly aware<br/>of them.")
('Ashen', "I assume you're here on Lu family business?<br/>You're quite a ways from Langport, though.")
('Ashen', "Seems everybody's traveling on business these days.")
(40451, "...Hah. I'd expect no less of you, Lady Ashen.")
('Van', 'Xiongshou, huh? Not from the Lu family, are they?')
('Ashen', 'Indeed not. Though they seem awfully casual for<br/>xiongshou—normally they try to hide their presence.')
('Ashen', "So is the message being sent here that a xiongshou<br/>doesn't even need to try in order to keep tabs on<br/>little old me?")
(40451, "I think you're mistaken, Lady Ashen.")
(40451, 'My master simply wishes to banish these clouds<br/>looming over Heiyue, that we might shine brighter.')
('Ashen', "...It's really impressive how you can say that with a<br/>straight face.")
('Ashen', "You really think your master's looking to resolve all<br/>this peacefully? That just doesn't sound right, does it?")
(40451, '...')
('Ashen', "Now, obviously, I'm not going to pick a fight<br/>with you. At least not in public.")
('Ashen', "But IF—that's a big if—your boss thinks he can get<br/>the better of us...")
('Ashen', '...then the Lu family will accept your<br/>challenge anytime.')
(40451, 'Hmph...')
(40451, 'I will let them know.')
('Ashen', "All right, let's head back now.")
('Van', 'Okay, wait... Gimme a second to process all that.')
('Van', "Heiyue's own little princess, huh? Apple doesn't fall<br/>far from the tree, there.")
('Van', "Remind me not to piss you off, I like having my head<br/>on my neck. Scary to think what would've happened<br/>if I turned you down...")
('Ashen', "How rude! I wouldn't have done anything...probably.")
('Ashen', "I do value our friendship, Van, and I'd like to keep it<br/>that way! Heehee.")
('Ashen', 'I really owe you, both for Langport and for keeping<br/>Aaron safe. I mean it!')
('Van', "Oh, I know. I was just messin' with you.")
('Van', "But what were you talkin' about back there?<br/>Sounded like some kinda turf war business.")
('Ashen', "Oh, just some shadows sneaking around. It's nothing<br/>to worry about.")
('Ashen', "Bàbà might've told you, but Heiyue is split between<br/>several groups and families. Sometimes we have to tie<br/>those loose ends back up ourselves.")
('Ashen', "'Hope for the best, plan for the worst.' That's what<br/>Yéye always said.")
('Ashen', "Okay, let's head on back! I should let Bàbà know<br/>what happened.")
('Ashen', 'Do you wanna see him? He should be back now, and<br/>I think he might wanna thank you for today.')
('Van', "I'm good, thanks.")
('Van', "That's kinda like askin' me to walk into a minefield,<br/>no offense.")
('Ashen', "Hey, come on! Don't antagonize us like that!")
('System', 'Ashen eventually got Van to reconsider—read:<br/>comply—and exchange pleasantries with her father.')
('System', 'Despite being worn out from the encounter, Van met<br/>up with the rest of the gang and went right back<br/>to work.')
