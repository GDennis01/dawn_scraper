('Agnès', 'I-Is this place a relic from the Middle Ages?')
('Van', 'Might go back to the Dark Ages, even.')
('Van', "Edith might not have a leg up on the Old Capital's<br/>history, but it still goes back to the Middle Ages<br/>easy enough.")
('Van', "Tack on all the subways and waterways we've been<br/>building, and the underground's a sprawling mess and<br/>a half now.")
('Agnès', 'I see... I suppose it does make sense that a place like<br/>this would exist here when you think about it enough.')
('Agnès', '...?')
('Van', 'Hmm? Wha...?')
('Van', 'Crap.')
('Agnès', 'Van! I-Is that a...?')
('Van', 'A monster. Well, a spirit, more like.')
('Van', "Never seen THEM in the capital. What the hell's up<br/>with this?")
('Agnès', '...')
('Van', "Sure you don't wanna turn back and wait outside<br/>the station?")
('Van', "The café'd be a good spot to—")
('Agnès', "No. I'm fine.")
('Agnès', 'I have a feeling my staff and arts will be highly<br/>effective against foes like these.')
('Agnès', "So if anything, I'm relieved I came with you instead<br/>of staying behind.")
('Van', '...Haha.')
('Van', "Got me good. Then let's do this.")
('Van', "I'll back you up, so feel free to go hog wild.")
('Agnès', 'Then I will!')
('Van', 'Oh, right. Lemme give you these just in case.')
('System', 'Obtained <br/> and <br/>.')
('Agnès', "These are Xipha quartz, aren't they?")
('Van', "Yeah. Insert 'em into your Xipha's slots, and they'll let<br/>you use different shards.")
('Van', "Give it a shot. You'll pick it up faster than me<br/>explainin' it.")
('Agnès', 'Then I will!')
('System', 'Press  to open the Orbment menu.')
('Agnès', 'Whew... I think I have a better handle on them now.')
('Van', "You did good, but no lettin' your guard down because<br/>of it.")
('Agnès', 'R-Right. Of course.')
('Van', '(Really was a hell of a performance—especially since<br/>this is likely her first day fighting for real.)')
('Van', "(No way she wasn't raised with a silver spoon in her<br/>mouth, but she's braver than most would give her<br/>credit for.)")
('Van', "(Throw in the weird orbment she's after...and I<br/>got questions. Just who is this girl?)")
('Agnès', 'By the way...')
('Van', "S'up?")
('Agnès', "I've been bracing myself well enough against monsters<br/>and spirits so far...")
('Agnès', '...but do you think you could also tell me a little more<br/>about A since we might be going up against them?')
('Van', '*sigh* Guess I should, huh?')
('Van', 'Ordinary people are better off not knowing a<br/>damn thing...')
('Van', "...but if they're after your great-grandfather's<br/>memento, then I guess there's no getting around it.")
('Agnès', "That's what I was thinking, too.")
('Van', "First, 'A' is just a codename.")
('Van', "It's short for 'Almata.' They're mafia that go way back<br/>here in Calvard.")
('Agnès', "I don't like the sound of that already...")
('Van', "Still, they weren't that big a group back then.")
('Van', "We're not talking about a big Eastern syndicate here.<br/>They were nothin'...")
('Van', "...until they weren't. Over the past few years, they've<br/>gotten much, much bigger.")
('Van', "Now they're the talk of the criminal underworld.")
('Agnès', 'W-Wow...')
('Agnès', 'But their name never ends up in the paper, I assume?')
('Van', "Yeah. Obvious why big papers like the Tyrell Times<br/>won't cover 'em, but even gossip rags don't have<br/>the balls.")
('Van', "It's an unspoken rule: cross the line and you're done.")
('Agnès', '...')
('Van', "I still don't know what the deal is with this memento<br/>you're after...")
('Van', "...but you really should've gone to the guild or<br/>the cops.")
('Van', 'You still could if you wanted.')
('Agnès', 'B-But...')
('Van', "Well, not my job to force you to turn to 'em.<br/>Mine's to be there if you feel like you can't.")
('Van', "The best outcome here's for us to get the goods<br/>before A can, then have the guild swoop in and take<br/>the glory.")
('Van', 'Two birds with one stone. Three, even.')
('Agnès', "Y-You make the guild sound like they're your<br/>cleanup crew...")
('Agnès', 'Heehee. You really have no shame, do you?')
('Van', "Mighty pleased that you'd think so. Now let's get a<br/>move on.")
('Agnès', 'Of course. ...Oh! Come to think of it...')
('Van', 'Hmm?')
('Agnès', 'When you first refused my request for help...')
('Agnès', '...did you already suspect that the mafia was involved<br/>in this?')
('Van', 'Heh.<br/>(She really is a sharp one.)')
('Van', "I had a hunch, yeah. There's been somethin' ominous<br/>in the air since last night.")
('Agnès', 'Oh, wow...')
('Van', "Can't get much more Middle Ages than this.<br/>Gargoyles, huh?")
('Van', 'Maybe Giacomo had a better eye for hideouts than<br/>I thought.')
('Agnès', '...')
('Van', 'Look at that.')
('Van', "It's the spitting image of that picture you showed me.")
('Agnès', "It really is. It perfectly matches the sketches in my<br/>great-grandfather's diaries.")
('Agnès', '*sniffle* I finally found it...')
('Van', "Heh. I'm happy for ya.")
('Van', 'So it really does look like an orbment...but why is<br/>it glowing?')
('Van', 'Get back!')
('Agnès', '...?!')
('Agnès', 'I-It went inside the statue!')
('Van', "Well, that's not good.")
('Van', '(Are they...resonating?)')
('Agnès', 'V-Van?')
('Van', "Tch. We're gonna have to take care of these guys<br/>before we can make with your memento.")
('Van', "But I know that's not enough to stop you at this<br/>point, right?")
('Van', "Time to bust out your crafts, SCLMs—the<br/>works—'cause here's where the real show begins!")
('Agnès', 'R-Right!')
('Agnès', '*pant* *pant*')
('Van', 'The mages of the Middle Ages left behind some<br/>damn tough guardians for us.')
('Van', "It bugs me why they'd pick now of all times to<br/>start movin'...")
('Van', '...Well, whatever. You really stepped up.')
('Van', 'It takes a brave soul to fight like that against<br/>the unexpected.')
('Agnès', 'You mean it...?')
('Agnès', "Thank... Thank you. I'm very fortunate I had you to<br/>show me the ropes.")
('Van', 'Heh.')
('Van', 'Lemme be the one to pick it up.')
('Agnès', "That's a good idea...")
('Van', "Looks safe enough to me. Well—here's what you<br/>came here for.")
('Van', '(Did it just react with her like a combat orbment?)')
('Agnès', 'I finally hold a Genesis in my hands...')
('Agnès', "There's still more to find, but...I did it, Mom.<br/>Grandmother.")
('Van', '...')
('Van', "Say, Agnès. This great-grandfather of yours wouldn't<br/>happen to be—")
('Agnès', 'Eeek!')
('Agnès', '...?!')
('Van', 'There you are.')
('Mafia A', 'Well, well. Impressive footwork.')
('Agnès', 'No...')
('Van', "Was waitin' on the duo from Almata to make their<br/>grand entrance.")
('Mafia A', 'Heh heh. I see our reputation precedes us.')
('Mafia B', 'You must be Van Arkride—the spriggan.')
('Van', 'And my reputation precedes me.')
('Van', "Look: I'm not opposed to pickin' up some work from<br/>you types most of the time.")
('Van', "Just as long as you don't cross the line—which you<br/>just did by firing at us.")
('Mafia A', "That's too bad. We were only aiming for your limbs.")
('Mafia B', 'We have no intention of killing the girl. Not since<br/>she seems to be connected to that device.')
('Mafia B', "You, however, don't have that same privilege.")
('Agnès', '...')
('Van', "You're real pros, huh? So much it makes me sick.")
('Van', 'But it also makes my job a lot easier.')
('Mafia A', 'Hmm?')
('Mafia A', 'Agh!')
('Mafia B', 'Ugh!')
('Van', "Ah-ah. Don't move.")
('Mafia A', '...')
('Mafia B', '...')
('Agnès', 'Phew...')
('Mafia A', 'A practitioner of the Gekka school, I assume.')
('Mafia B', 'Even if that weapon marks you as more of a military<br/>close-combat type.')
('Van', "Good eye, but sorry. I'm not with the Gekka school.")
('Van', "Anyway, you don't look like you know all that much<br/>about the device itself...")
('Van', "...but you're still gonna tell us everything you DO<br/>know—and why you're after it.")
('Agnès', "Van... I'm certainly curious, too.")
('Agnès', 'What does a criminal organization even want<br/>this for?')
('Mafia A', "Beats me. We're just following orders.")
('Mafia B', "And an order's an order—even if it costs us our lives!")
('Van', '...?!')
('Agnès', 'What?!')
('Van', 'Shit!')
('Van', '...?!')
('Van', 'Gah!')
('Agnès', 'Eeek!')
('Van', 'You good?!')
('Agnès', "I'm fine! I'm more worried about you!")
('Van', 'Fast-acting enhancement drugs, huh?')
('Van', "Didn't think you guys had gone THAT low.")
('Van', 'Ever heard the stories about foreign mafias getting<br/>destroyed by that stuff?')
('Mafia A', "I'll thank you not to compare us to small fry like<br/>Crossbell's Revache.")
('Mafia B', "We stand head and shoulders above them. And now<br/>we're gonna stand head, shoulders, and feet<br/>above you!")
('Van', 'Ugh... Gah...!')
('Mafia A', "Hahaha! Where'd that spunk from earlier go?")
('Mafia B', "We're gonna enjoy this!")
('Agnès', 'No... Van...')
('Mafia A', 'Got that outta your system?')
('Mafia B', "You're done, spriggan!")
('Van', '...')
('Agnès', "DON'T YOU DARE!")
('Van', '...?!')
('Mafia A', 'The hell?!')
('Mafia B', 'Fine, then! You can die, too!')
('Van', '(Could do a shard shield—nah. No time!)')
('Van', "(Damn it! Don't die over a piece of shit like me!)")
('Agnès', 'Wha...?')
('Van', '...?!')
('Van', "What's going on...?")
('Agnès', "There's a light coming from my great-grandfather's...")
('Mare', 'Oh, boy. You sure are in a sorry mess.')
('Van', 'What?! How is this...?')
('Agnès', 'The holo from your Xipha?')
('Mare', "Well, 'Van.' The choice is yours.")
('Mare', 'Will you bear the nightmare? Or not?')
('Van', '...')
('Agnès', 'Wh-What are you...?')
('Van', "Since when can holos appear like this...? World's full<br/>of mysteries.")
('Van', "Are you askin' me that question of your own free will?")
('Mare', 'Huh? Of course I am.')
('Mare', "Just so we're clear, I could not care less how much<br/>trouble you're in.")
('Mare', "I'm just here to know one thing: will you bear the<br/>nightmare, or not?")
('Agnès', 'V-Van...')
('Van', "Man... Today's just one thing after another, huh?")
('Van', "My life's been a living nightmare for more than a<br/>decade now, so what's a little more fire when you're<br/>already in the depths?")
('Mafia A', 'This is unbelievable...!')
('Mafia B', 'Wh-What IS he?! Augh...')
('Agnès', '...')
('Agnès', 'Van! Are you all right? How do you feel?')
('Van', "I'm fine. Tired as all hell, but I don't feel any pain.")
('Van', "Can't believe I just took down a pair of drugged-up<br/>mafiosos like they were snot-nosed kids. What<br/>a monster.")
('Agnès', 'What was that? You saw Mare, too, right?')
('Van', 'Yeah.')
('Van/Grendel', 'Yeah, yeah. Just tell me what you want.')
('Van', "Figures. All she spits out is what she's programmed.")
('Van', "She's got no sentience. The tech hasn't come far<br/>enough to give her any.")
('Agnès', 'But...')
('Agnès', '...was it the Genesis, then?')
('Van', "Can't imagine it was a fluke.")
('Van', "So that thing's called a Genesis?")
('Agnès', "Yes—or that's what my great-grandfather called it in<br/>his diaries.")
('Agnès', "It's supposed to be one of eight, called collectively the<br/>Oct-Geneses.")
('Van', "You sayin' there's eight of these?")
('Van', "I'm gonna guess it was behind everything that<br/>happened here.")
('Van', "Behind Mare showin' up, behind me turnin' into that<br/>weird monster...")
('Van', "Behind spirits poppin' up down here, too.")
('Agnès', "Then we're of the same mind.")
('Agnès', "The diaries described them as for 'experimental<br/>observation' and nothing more.")
('Van', 'Course they elected to omit the finer details.')
('Van', "You know, when I accepted this job, I didn't think<br/>it'd be from a relative of the one and only<br/>Professor Epstein.")
('Agnès', '...?!')
('Van', 'Dead on, huh?')
('Van', 'That thing was made half a century ago around the<br/>time of the Orbal Revolution.')
('Van', "It's easy to tell by lookin' at it just how much<br/>precision and skill went into makin' it.")
('Van', "Then you got that it's an orbment capable of doing<br/>artifact-level stuff.")
('Van', "Even Epstein's three disciples couldn't have made<br/>somethin' so advanced back then.")
('Van', "Knock them out of the running, and you're left with<br/>the father of modern tech, Claude Epstein.")
('Agnès', '...')
('Agnès', "I'm sorry for hiding it from you.")
('Agnès', "I'll tell you everything there is to say. It all started<br/>when—")
('Van', 'Not now. Put it away—quick.')
('Elaine', 'Van! Are you all right?!')
('Elaine', 'Oh...')
('Kincaid', 'I see we were a few minutes too late.')
('Bracer Alvis', 'Those two are—')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "They're from Almata! We finally caught them!")
('Bracer Alvis', 'Get lost! This is our territory!')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "Who do you think you're talking to? This isn't a job<br/>for civilians!")
('Elaine', 'Just what happened here? I can see that you fought<br/>them, but beyond that...')
('Van', 'We fought, yeah. With how pumped fulla drugs they<br/>were, it was a miracle we could make it out with our<br/>skin intact.')
('Elaine', '...!')
('Kincaid', 'Heh. As curious as I am about HOW you<br/>emerged victorious...')
('Kincaid', '...I trust you were able to help your client?')
('Agnès', '...')
('Van', "No comment. That's between me and her.")
('Van', "Now, I know I owe both sides here a debt, but<br/>consider 'em paid.")
('Van', "They might be at the bottom of the chain, but they're<br/>still in Almata. You can have one each.")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', 'Excuse me?')
('Bracer Alvis', 'Wh-Who gave you the authority to—')
('Elaine', '...I suppose we do owe him for neutralizing them.')
('Kincaid', 'Very well. We shall take them in between us.')
('Van', "Maybe if you're lucky enough, they'll even talk.<br/>Now come on—let's get outta here.")
('Agnès', 'Oh... Umm... Sure. But let me help you walk—')
('Van', "I'm good, I'm good.")
('Kincaid', 'This is clearly only the beginning of something<br/>much greater.')
('Kincaid', 'Sharpen your skills while you can, Van.')
('Van', 'Will do, René.')
('Kincaid', 'Kincaid.')
('Elaine', '...')
('Elaine', "(I can't let him keep living like this.)")
('Elaine', '(Why must you insist on shouldering all of the<br/>burden yourself?)')
('Van', "Here we are. This was one of Giacomo's old bases.")
('Agnès', 'Sure enough, it looks as though the police have<br/>already seized everything he left behind here.')
('Feri', "You never know! It's still possible they<br/>overlooked something!")
('Van', "My thoughts exactly. Let's give this place a good<br/>combover and see if we can find clues to wherever his<br/>blackmail notebook is.")
('Agnès', 'Is it just me, or does this brick look different?')
('Van', 'Yeah. Looks like it was made with a different<br/>kinda clay.')
('Van', "Let's try pokin' around it just in case.")
('System', 'Van gave the brick and all those surrounding it a<br/>light knock.')
('Feri', 'The one that looks different sounds different, too!')
('Feri', 'It was a lot lighter.')
('Agnès', "I've read stories where bricks are used as switches.<br/>I wonder if that could be the case here.")
('Van', 'Only one way to find out.')
('Van', "I don't think we can outright remove it, but we can at<br/>least shift it around a bit.")
('System', 'After moving the brick, they discovered that letters<br/>were written upon its surface.')
('Feri', "Oh, look! Something's written on it!")
('Agnès', "It says 'te 203.'")
('Van', "Hmm... Let's put it back how it was before we think<br/>on it.")
('Feri', 'I think I got it!')
('Feri', "The other code was 'No/', and if we put them<br/>together, it says 'note'! Like 'notebook'!")
('Agnès', "You're right!")
('Agnès', "It doesn't necessarily mean that this leads to the book<br/>we're looking for, but they ARE connected. That's a<br/>good start.")
('Van', 'Now we just need to solve the rest of the cipher.')
('Feri', "Maybe we'll be able to do that if we visit that taco<br/>stand in Riverside.")
('Feri', "Let's head on over there and see!")
('Feri', 'I think I got it!')
('Feri', "The other code was 'No/', and if we put them<br/>together, it says 'note'! Like 'notebook'!")
('Agnès', "You're right!")
('Agnès', "It doesn't necessarily mean that this leads to the book<br/>we're looking for, but they ARE connected. That's a<br/>good start.")
('Agnès', "And I can't help but think that the '203' looks like a<br/>room number...")
('Agnès', 'Perhaps it could be referring to Horizon Heim<br/>room 203?')
('Van', "Heh. Nice job. Was thinkin' the same thing.")
('Van', "Let's head back to Riverside and see if we're right.")
('Feri', "Hmm... I wonder if this is some kind of code?<br/>This by itself doesn't really give us enough to go on.")
('Van', "Maybe it's one of those ciphers where you need to<br/>collect all the pieces to understand the meaning.")
('Van', "Okay. Still not sure this code's gonna take us to<br/>wherever this blackmail book is, but we gotta keep<br/>at it.")
('Van', "Not much else caught my eye in his hideout.<br/>Don't think we're gonna find anything else even if we<br/>keep lookin'.")
('Van', 'Off to the next place we go.')
('Agnès', 'Next is the underground hideout in the Riverside<br/>District, then.')
('Agnès', "Let's get going.")
('System', 'There is a candelabrum with some candles in it.<br/>Nothing appears to be out of the ordinary.')
('Feri', "I was wondering if we might find some letters written<br/>on the candles or something, but it doesn't look<br/>like it.")
('Feri', "I guess we'll just have to look somewhere else.")
('System', 'The group examined the markings on the floor with<br/>scrutinous eyes, but nothing appeared to be out of<br/>the ordinary.')
('Van', "He must've figured writing somethin' on the floor<br/>would be too obvious.")
('Van', "Let's try somewhere more out of sight.<br/>Somewhere people would be likely to overlook.")
('Agnès', "I like that idea. Let's try searching somewhere<br/>else, then.")
('System', 'Obtained <br/> and <br/>.')
('System', 'Press  to open the Orbment menu, then equip<br/>the quartz.')
('Agnès', "Now we're ready to move on!")
('Van', "Yeah. Let's get—")
('Van', 'Wait. This feels like...')
('Van', '...The higher elements are active here. What the hell?')
('Agnès', 'What do you mean?')
('Van', "I'm sure you can tell this part just from the fights<br/>we've had so far, but...")
('Van', "...monsters're usually only weak to the four basic<br/>elements: fire, water, earth, and wind.")
('Van', "But every once in a while, you'll find a place where<br/>they can be weak or resistant to the higher elements<br/>of time, space, and mirage.")
('Agnès', "You're saying that this is one such place?")
('Van', 'Pretty sure it is, yeah.')
('Van', "Either way, we'll soon find out. Let's get movin'.")
('System', "A list of shard skills have been added to the<br/>notebook's help page.")
('Van', 'Bah. They sure snuck up on us.')
('Agnès', 'There are an awful lot of them, too...')
('Van', "There sure are—but it's times like these that shards<br/>really shine.")
('Van', 'Time to teach you how to use SCLMs.')
('Agnès', 'What are those?')
('Van', "You'll see. I'll give you the rundown while we fight!")
('Van', 'Good job. You kept up pretty well.')
('Agnès', "So that's the power of an SCLM...")
('Agnès', "I've never been able to understand how someone else<br/>was going to act so clearly before.")
('Van', "Yeah. It's a lot like the combat links system used by<br/>Erebonia's fifth-generation ARCUS battle orbments.")
('Van', 'The ARCUS units never saw much use outside of the<br/>Empire, though.')
('Van', 'Still, combat links were mainly designed to be used by<br/>two-man teams...')
('Van', "...whereas SCLM is a system where it's a lot easier to<br/>switch around partners.")
('Van', 'That makes it a force to be reckoned with when used<br/>by large groups.')
('Agnès', "Shards really are amazing, aren't they?")
('Agnès', 'I never imagined you could use them for so much.')
('Van', "Yeah. I'm not an expert on 'em, either, mind you.<br/>Still got a lot to learn, myself.")
('Van', 'But even I can tell that the Xipha standard has a<br/>whole lotta potential.')
('Van', 'Looks like you were right about that orbal staff of<br/>yours working well against spirits, too.')
('Agnès', "Yes! I'm glad that proved true.")
('Agnès', 'The more we do it, the more confident I am in my<br/>ability to fight.')
('Agnès', "I suspect we're going to need to make more use of<br/>SCLMs the farther we advance through here...")
('Agnès', '...so I think it would be prudent for me to be a little<br/>closer to the front line. What do you think?')
('Van', "I'm fine with 'a little.'")
('Van', "I still don't want you goin' out in front of me, though.")
('Agnès', 'I can accept that!')
('System', 'It is now possible to change the party leader.')
('Agnès', 'There are even more monsters this time...')
('Van', "Yeah—but I might have an idea how to take care<br/>of 'em.")
('Van', "How's my boost gauge, Mare?")
('Mare', 'Boost Gauge fully replenished.')
('Van', 'Heh. Good stuff.')
('Agnès', 'What was that about?')
('Van', "I'll show you. Time for your second lesson in<br/>usin' shards!")
('Van', 'That wraps that up.')
('Agnès', "S-Boosts seem like they'll be very useful when the<br/>timing is right.")
('Van', "They are, though they ain't really the kinda thing you<br/>have to save for just the right time.")
('Van', "Just use 'em when you can. That's all there is to it.")
('Agnès', "Well, isn't that convenient?")
('Agnès', "I'll keep that in mind!")
('System', 'About Breakable Objects')
('System', 'Attack vases, boxes, and the like scattered across<br/>fields and dungeons to break them.')
('System', 'Destroying these will sometimes net items and CP in<br/>addition to filling the boost gauge, so no need to keep<br/>them pristine!')
('Agnès', 'What a massive foe...')
('Van', 'And the bigger they are, the harder they tend to hit.')
('Van', "Try not to get too close. We're best fightin' it from<br/>a distance.")
('System', 'About Deadly Strikes')
('System', 'Every so often, certain enemies will use powerful<br/>attacks called Deadly Strikes.')
('System', 'These attacks cannot be avoided, and if you are hit by<br/>one, you will be forced into battle at a disadvantage.')
('System', 'It is best to either keep your distance and remain<br/>vigilant for these attacks, or to deploy your own<br/>shards first.')
('System', 'Bear in mind that enemies with low HP tend to use<br/>Deadly Strikes more frequently.')
('Van', "All right. Let's do it!")
('Mare', "Okay! Doin' it, then!")
('Mare', "Shard swell! The Grendel's all yours!")
('Mafia A', 'Agh!')
('Mafia B', 'What the—?!')
('Agnès', '...')
('Van/Grendel', '(What IS this...feeling?)')
('Mafia A', "Argh... Well, I'd take fighting this thing over our<br/>bosses any day of the week!")
('Mafia B', "You're damn right! We're taking you down in the<br/>name of Almata!")
('Van/Grendel', 'OHHHHHHHH!')
('Van', 'I was worried this might happen.')
('Van', "The tracker's so old that its signal is too weak to<br/>accurately follow underground like this.")
('Agnès', 'Should we split up and see if we can find them?')
('Risette', 'Please wait one moment.')
('Risette', "The transmitter's orbal waves are faint, but it is<br/>possible to detect them.")
('Risette', "So if I use Marduk's search software, I should be able<br/>to pinpoint the transmitter's rough location.")
('Feri', 'You can really do that?!')
('Aaron', "Good thing we've got you with us.")
('Risette', 'It worked.')
('Risette', 'The transmitter is currently north of us and moving<br/>farther into the ruins.')
('Agnès', "You really did it! That's amazing!")
('Van', "You're really earnin' your keep, huh? Let's get movin'.")
('Feri', 'Right!')
('Aaron', 'Got it.')
('Agnès', "This is one of Giacomo's old hideouts!")
('Van', "Huh. There's a funny coincidence.")
('Van', "Anyway, we ain't got time to waste. We're goin' in!")
('System', 'Several minutes before...')
(40301, 'You son of a bitch! What are we even doing here?!')
(40302, "You can shove your 'divine punishment' up your ass!")
('Walton', 'Oh, Aidios, please forgive me for my sins...')
('Guru', 'The purification ritual before the ceremony is<br/>now complete.')
('Guru', 'Now I shall summon a servant of the Goddess to<br/>deliver your punishment.')
('Guru', 'O one of Her six hands, bless us with your presence!')
(40301, 'Wha—?!')
(40302, "Th-That's no servant of the Goddess! That's<br/>a monster!")
('Walton', "I can't believe it...")
('Guru', 'Heh heh. I will admit that as much as I tried to make<br/>this seem like a legitimate church, this part straddles<br/>the line of believability.')
('Guru', 'Unfortunately, this is the only powerful monster the<br/>artifact is capable of summoning, so I fear it will have<br/>to do.')
('Guru', "It's a little nightmare to control, I'll have you know!<br/>It refuses to do what I tell it to unless it gets fed in a<br/>timely manner.")
('Walton', 'Wh-What is the meaning of this?! Have you been<br/>deceiving us, Father?!')
('Guru', 'Not at all. I never expected anyone to really believe<br/>my lies—you just happened to be gullible enough to<br/>do so.')
('Guru', 'Besides, when I said I would send you to meet your<br/>maker, I very much meant it.')
('Guru', 'That is exactly where you will be going.')
(40301, "I-I can't believe it... Is this the end for us?")
(40302, "I-Is an apology what you want?! I'll apologize all you<br/>want, so please...!")
('Walton', "I'm sorry, Stephan... I'm sorry, Dear... Forgive me for<br/>my stupidity...")
('Van', "Good job outin' yourself, you shady bastard.")
('Van', "I sure didn't expect you to have an artifact, though.<br/>Where'd you get your hands on that thing?")
(40304, 'Wh-Who are you?!')
('Guru', 'No, I know you! You were at the ceremony earlier!')
('Van', "You got us. We're Arkride Solutions, and the son of<br/>one of these fine gents asked us to come<br/>investigate you.")
('Walton', "You're looking at me... Then Stephan sent you?!")
('Risette', 'Indeed. He wanted to know if you were safe and<br/>nothing more.')
('Risette', 'However, now that we know you are in danger, we<br/>cannot turn a blind eye.')
('Risette', 'Move behind us, everyone.')
(40301, 'R-Right!')
('Agnès', 'You should also know that we recorded what you<br/>said earlier.')
('Agnès', "I was disgusted by what I heard, too. You talk of good<br/>deeds, and yet it's all just a scheme to make<br/>you money.")
('Agnès', "If that wasn't bad enough, now you're treating their<br/>lives like playthings. What are you even trying to do?!")
('Guru', 'You just said it yourself: all I care about is<br/>getting rich.')
('Guru', 'All I had to do was dream up a plausible-sounding<br/>church and flex my acting chops a little, and the mira<br/>just flowed right in.')
('Guru', "I stumbled on this artifact by complete coincidence,<br/>but it lets me get rid of anyone who stands in my way,<br/>so I'm more than happy to keep using it.")
('Guru', "Heh. I can't picture a better enterprise than this one.")
('Feri', "Maybe it is partly true that people shouldn't have<br/>fallen for your lies, and wanting to earn money isn't a<br/>bad thing in itself...")
('Feri', "...but you're abusing the Goddess' name, and your<br/>way of earning is just so shameless and scummy that<br/>you don't deserve to get away with it!")
('Aaron', "It's a clever little operation you've got going on here.")
('Aaron', 'Too bad it turns my stomach just thinking about it.')
('Guru', "Well! You're free to think whatever you want, because<br/>you'll be carrying those feelings to the grave in a<br/>few minutes.")
('Guru', 'Go forth, divine messenger! You will be punishing<br/>them first!')
('Van', "C'mon! We're takin' him down!")
('Middle-Aged Man 1 (City; Alt Color Version 1)', 'N-No! Are you all right, Father?!')
('Guru', "Y-Yes, I'm fine. I just never imagined that my pet<br/>would be defeated...")
('Van', 'Whew... Now we can finally talk for real.')
('Feri', "*huff* That thing was tough. But now you've lost, and<br/>it's time for you to admit it and let everyone go!")
('Aaron', "That was a fun fight. But it's time to admit you've<br/>lost, Father Fraudster.")
('Guru', 'Never! As long as I have this flute, I will never lose!')
('Guru', "Get back up! You still haven't wiped the floor with<br/>them for me!")
('Van', '(What was that sound? Was it from the ceiling or<br/>the flute?)')
('Van', "(I think it was both. That's bad—they're both at<br/>their limit.)")
('Van', "(If he blows the flute again, it's gonna break and the<br/>monster's gonna go berserk.)")
('Van', "(...Which is gonna make the crack in the ceiling even<br/>bigger, and that'll bring the entire thing down.)")
('Van', '(Should I finish off the monster before that<br/>can happen?)')
('Van', "(Or try and warn our conman priest even if he's<br/>probably not gonna listen?)")
('Van', "(I've got no time to stress over this. I'm just gonna<br/>have to try my luck.)")
('Van', "Listen up, 'cause I'm only gonna say this once:")
('Van', "If you blow on that flute again, you're finished.")
('Guru', 'Hah! Sore losers, are we?')
('Guru', "It's you who are finished! Go plead with the Goddess<br/>for Her forgiveness!")
('Guru', 'N-No! How could this happen?!')
('Agnès', 'Aah!')
('Middle-Aged Man 1 (City; Alt Color Version 1)', 'Nooo!')
('Feri', 'How does it still have this much strength left?!')
('Aaron', 'Still up for more, huh?!')
('Risette', "It's more formidable than I thought!")
('Van', 'Bah. You damn idiot!')
('Van', "Get out the room, everyone! The ceiling's<br/>gonna collapse!")
('Agnès', 'Oh, no!')
('Feri', 'Retreat!')
('Aaron', "Tch! We're outta here!")
('Risette', "(From this distance, we won't be able to—)")
('Guru', "Wait! Your judgment isn't finished yet!")
('Guru', "Don't let them get away! ATTACK THEM!")
('Guru', 'Aaaaaargh!')
('Guru', "W-Wait! We're really going to be—!")
('Guru', 'AAAAAAH!')
('Agnès', '...')
('Feri', '...He got what was coming to him.')
('Aaron', "...Can't say he didn't deserve it.")
('Risette', 'If only he had listened to what Mr. Arkride said...')
('Van', 'He made his choice. This is on him.')
('Van', "Anyway, we're goin' back to the surface.<br/>You're coming with us, too.")
('Walton', 'Does that mean...?')
('Van', "(I've got no time to stress over this. I'm just gonna<br/>have to finish the monster!)")
('Guru', "No, you don't!")
('Guru', 'N-No! How could this happen?!')
('Agnès', 'Aah!')
('Middle-Aged Man 1 (City; Alt Color Version 1)', 'Nooo!')
('Feri', 'How does it still have this much strength left?!')
('Aaron', 'Still up for more, huh?!')
('Risette', "It's more formidable than I thought!")
('Van', "Bah! We're short on time here!")
('Agnès', 'What do you mean?!')
('Van', "Get the other guys outta the room! I'll handle the<br/>monster on my own!")
('Risette', 'Understood. Then please, be careful!')
('Van', 'Here I go! I hope this works!')
('Van', '*huff* Whew... That was a close one.')
('Van', "I don't think the ceiling will hold much longer either<br/>way, though, so I'd still better hurry on out of here.")
('Guru', "I can't believe this is happening... I was supposed to<br/>be invincible as long as I had that flute.")
('Van', "Tch. Almost forgot about you. Fiiine, I'll drag you<br/>outta here, too.")
('Van', 'Phew. Not a moment too soon, huh?')
('Agnès', "I had no idea that the ceiling was about to collapse.<br/>I'm amazed you realized, Van.")
('Agnès', "More than anything, I'm just glad that everyone's<br/>all right...")
('Risette', "I couldn't agree more.")
('Risette', "Regardless, we're going to need to take this conman<br/>in robes into custody.")
('Feri', 'Should we hand him over to the police when we get<br/>back to the surface? This seems a bit much for us to<br/>handle on our own.')
('Aaron', 'Should we hand him over to the police when we get<br/>back to the surface? This seems a bit much for us to<br/>handle on our own.')
('Van', "Yeah, I think that's the best plan.")
('Van', 'As for you, we got somewhere else to take you.')
('Walton', 'Oh! Does that mean...?')
