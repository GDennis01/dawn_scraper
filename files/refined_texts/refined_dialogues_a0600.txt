('Agnès', "First, I'd like to tell you a little about myself.<br/>My name is Agnès Claudel.")
('Agnès', 'I currently attend a school in the Auber District—')
('Van', "The name's Van. Van Arkride.")
('Van', '...')
('Agnès', 'Uhh...')
('Van', 'I just wanna make this clear.')
('Van', "I'm NOT doing this 'cause I couldn't say no to<br/>that tart. Got it?")
('Van', '...')
('Agnès', 'Uhh...')
('Van', 'I just wanna make this clear.')
('Van', "I'm NOT doing this 'cause I couldn't say no to<br/>that tart. Got it?")
('Harry', 'Hey, Mark! Look at this!')
('Mark', 'A-... A-... A-...')
('Mark', 'A BIKE?!')
('Harry', 'Heh, yup! My dad went and bought it for<br/>me yesterday.')
('Harry', "What d'ya think, Mark? Cool, right?")
('Mark', "It's so cool! CRAZY cool!")
('Mark', 'Come on, Harry! Take me for a ride!')
('Harry', 'You bet I will!! You gotta experience this awesome<br/>ride first-hand...')
('Harry', '...But wait, how are you supposed to ride this thing?<br/>I just pushed it all the way here...')
('Mark', 'Come on, Harry! Hurry up!!')
('Harry', 'H-Hey...! W-Wait a second!')
('Agnès', '(Ahaha... I think bike riding is something you need to<br/>put proper practice into...)')
('Van', '(I keep seeing more and more of them around the<br/>capital, but I guess not everyone can ride them yet.)')
('Harry', "Hey, Van!! Teach me how to ride a bike, won't you?")
('Mark', 'Pleeease!!')
('Van', "Sure. That'll be 1000 mira an hour for the two of you.")
('Harry', 'Argh!! That much...?')
('Agnès', 'Ahahah...<br/>(Even kids have the same reaction.)')
('System', "Ahh, taking the morning off is so relaxing. You can't<br/>beat it.")
('System', 'Oh yeah, I bought a bike for Harry yesterday...')
('System', 'But now that I think about it, can he even ride one?')
('System', "It's his first bike, so I'm guessing not... Hmm, I'll<br/>have to help him practice sometime.")
('System', "I haven't been able to play with Harry much lately,<br/>after all. He was so desperate for a bike that I couldn't<br/>help but cave in...")
('System', "Oh well, at this rate I'm just gonna have to bite the<br/>bullet and find somewhere to help him practice.")
('Van', "Wait, you're...")
('System', "Oh, you've gotta be the guy from that Solutions place.")
('System', "But who's this young lady accompanying you?<br/>Heehee, you're just adorable.")
('Agnès', 'Ahaha... Thank you.')
('Agnès', "My name is Agnès. Starting today, I'll be working<br/>part time for Arkride Solutions.")
('System', "Oh, you're kidding! That's gotta be a tough job for<br/>someone your age.")
('System', 'Can I let you in on a little secret? Until recently, I was<br/>working for this quirky consultation office as well.')
('System', 'My skills impressed people so much that they<br/>nicknamed me ＂the Legend of the Eighth District.＂<br/>And I really had my hands full, let me tell you.')
('Agnès', 'R-Really...?!')
('Van', "There's no way that story's true... You<br/>believe anything.")
('Van', "Didn't you just hurt your back? Take it easy, alright?")
('System', "Heh, there's no chance of that. Still, I appreciate<br/>the thought.")
('Agnès', '(U-Um... Was she fibbing?)')
('Van', "(Damn, the future's looking bleaker by the minute.)")
('System', "Heh, there's no chance of that. Still, I appreciate<br/>the thought.")
('System', "It'd be lovely to speak to you again ♪")
('Agnès', "Ahaha, of course... That'd be lovely.")
('System', 'Edith Old Town... What an interesting place. I think<br/>I like it.')
('System', "These narrow streets give you a sense of this<br/>place's history... I doubt they've changed a bit since<br/>the democratic revolution.")
('System', "...All right, I'm gonna take lots of cute snaps and<br/>make a collection out of them.")
('System', "Once you've caught the photography bug, you want<br/>snap photos of everything.")
('System', "I gotta make sure I visit ALL the sights the city has<br/>to offer while I'm here!")
('System', 'Latest edition of the Tyrell Times, only 100 mira.')
('System', "Be quick. I don't have all day, either.")
('Van', '*sigh* Cranky as ever. No change there, then.')
('Agnès', "I'll take one copy of the Tyrell Times, and...<br/>You're going to buy some candy, right, Van...?")
('Agnès', "Excuse me, ma'am, but do you happen to be selling<br/>any new flavors?")
('System', '...Well, yes. Vanilla mint, 20 mira.')
('Van', 'Hey! How come you know my flavor-checking<br/>routine already?!')
('Agnès', 'Uhh, well... I saw it as my duty as part timer, I guess.')
('Agnès', 'Did it bother you...?')
('Van', "That's not what I meant...")
('System', 'Hey, what are you standing there chatting for? If you<br/>want to buy something, make it quick...!')
('Agnès', "I-I'm sorry...")
('Van', 'Hey, let me do that.')
('System', '...')
('System', "Try not to make too many girls cry, won't you?")
('Van', "Listen. It's not what it looks like, okay?")
('Agnès', "(Ahaha... It looks like there's been some kind<br/>of misunderstanding.)")
('System', "Well, whatever. I don't have all day.")
('System', 'No more messing around. If you wanna buy<br/>something, hurry up...!')
('System', 'Oh, hi Van. And hello, uhh...')
('System', "...Who's this?")
('Van', 'Oh, this is my new part timer.')
('Agnès', "My name is Agnès Claudel. It's a pleasure to<br/>meet you.")
('System', 'Y-Your name is Agnès?!')
('Agnès', 'Umm, well...yes...')
('System', "Look!! I'm reading ＂Sunshine Agnès＂ for the<br/>millionth time!!")
('System', 'The main character has the same name as you!')
('Van', 'Oh yeah, I remember that book. It was really popular<br/>a few years back.')
('Agnès', 'Ahaha, that brings back some nice memories... It was<br/>one of my favorites, too.')
('Agnès', "Agnès, the main character, is pretty blunt, but she's so<br/>strong-willed and cool.")
('Agnès', "The sad ending really stays with you, doesn't it?")
('System', 'Totally! And I LOVE the whole ＂witches and<br/>wizards＂ concept.')
('System', "Ugh!! I'm just obsessed with stories that have a bit of<br/>mystery to them!")
('System', "I mean, they make your imagination run wild,<br/>don't they? Like, what if things had<br/>ended differently?")
('Van', '(Hmm... Looks like we got her going.)')
('Agnès', "(Haha... I assumed she was the quiet sort, but she's<br/>actually pretty excitable.)")
('System', "I-I'm sorry. I just get super carried away when I'm<br/>talking about my favorite novels...")
('System', "But whatever! It's an amazing novel and I don't care<br/>who knows it!!")
('System', 'Ugh, if only this story was my real life!')
