('Doyen', 'Tourists concentrate their time in the three main<br/>districts of Oración, but I would encourage you to<br/>check out the suburbs as well.')
('Doyen', 'They house our three main schools: the prestigious<br/>Oración University, the music academy, and the<br/>art academy.')
('Doyen', "That's where the ETWS and Quincy Company<br/>factories lie also. They may not be prime sightseeing<br/>spots, but they're worth a visit.")
('Doyen', 'The cathedral looks especially beautiful against the<br/>backdrop of the starry sky.')
('Doyen', "If you want to visit it, you'll have to go to the<br/>East District.")
('Doyen', "That's where all the wealthy people live. They built<br/>their mansions around the cathedral.")
('Doyen', "It's not uncommon for cities to be constructed<br/>around churches.")
('Doyen', "You're all tourists, no? Would you be interested in<br/>hearing a little about our city?")
('Doyen', 'I may not be a guide, but I just love talking<br/>about Oración.')
('Doyen', "The South District is the first place most visitors see.<br/>It's where the city entrance lies.")
('Doyen', 'People of all walks of life live there, including many<br/>of our renowned artisans.')
('Doyen', 'The North District is populated by ordinary folks<br/>like me. Many tourists gather here to see the royal<br/>palace, which is visible in the distance.')
('Doyen', 'Because it touches the border facing the free cities, it<br/>has a long, prosperous history of trade and commerce.')
('Doyen', 'In short, the South District is where artisans gather,<br/>and this is where merchants go to sell their wares.')
('Vanessa', 'An Elsaim airship is currently docked at the airport.')
('Vanessa', "I imagine they're here to do trade. The upper class do<br/>love their Central Eastern goods.")
('Vanessa', 'Although, it does make me question their prejudice<br/>against immigrants. I suppose their own hypocrisy has<br/>not dawned on them.')
('Vanessa', 'If Oración enters a depression, my husband could<br/>very well lose his job.')
('Vanessa', 'People are anxious about the economy, and I can<br/>hardly blame them.')
('Vanessa', "However, taking it out on immigrants is both unfair<br/>and wrong. It's not as though conditions would<br/>improve if they were all gone.")
('Vanessa', 'A few years ago, terrorist attacks and riots were a<br/>common occurrence.')
('Vanessa', "I'm worried the anti-immigrant factions are back on<br/>the move.")
('Vanessa', 'Those groups gain traction when the business<br/>landscape and the government are unstable.')
('Vanessa', "When people's fear of employment loss is at its<br/>highest, they pounce—propagating the idea that<br/>immigrants will steal their jobs.")
('Officer Crema', "I'd like to thank you all again for everything<br/>you've done.")
('Officer Crema', 'I was out of control, and I needed someone to rein<br/>me in.')
('Officer Crema', "An officer of the law shouldn't let their anger get the<br/>best of them.")

('Officer Katarina', 'Thank you for saving Crema.')

('Officer Katarina', 'I normally patrol the South District, so if you ever see<br/>any trouble there, come talk to me.')
('Officer Katarina', "If Crema is pursuing Almata on her own, she's<br/>treading a dangerous path.")
('Officer Katarina', "You're the only ones I can count on. Please, save her.")
('Officer Katarina', 'Crema... Where are you?')
('Officer Katarina', "No, now isn't the time to panic. I need to contact<br/>those fixers.")

('Agnès', "(It can't hurt to take a look.)")
('Cepages', "I got today's Tyrell Times issue. I always trust them<br/>to give a thorough, accurate breakdown of the<br/>incidents they cover.")
('Cepages', "They gave a comprehensive summary of the Creil<br/>tragedy, but they didn't mention the Meld reporter<br/>that lost his life.")
('Cepages', "I only found out about that because I picked up<br/>yesterday's Meld issue this morning.")
('Cepages', 'Dingo carried the weight of Meld on his back.<br/>We lost someone truly special.')
('Cepages', 'I finished reading Buzzraider and the Royal<br/>Guardian, so my little buddy and I are going on a<br/>quick walk before heading home.')

('Cepages', 'The Royal Guardian focused on the effects it would<br/>have on Oración, while only lightly touching on the<br/>tragedy itself...')
('Cepages', 'Buzzraider zeroed in on the issues with the<br/>statements provided by other mass media companies<br/>and major politicians.')
('Cepages', 'Though I could tell each and every one of the<br/>reporters were utterly baffled by the incident itself.')
('Cepages', "Nonetheless, in just a few short days, they've been<br/>churning out story after story about it. Reporters sure<br/>have thick skin.")
('Cepages', 'Wha...? For real? Everyone in Creil Village was<br/>wiped out?!')
('Cepages', 'Well, if the Tyrell Times says so, then it must be true.<br/>I thought the bracers were supposed to take care of<br/>things like this.')
('Cepages', "Speaking of, I haven't seen any bracers around lately.<br/>Things must be chaotic back at the guild.")
('Cepages', "Security around the city feels a little too lax. I'd expect<br/>it to be a bit tighter after what happened to Creil.")

('Flick', 'Woof, woof!')
('Flick', '*whine* Grr...')

('Amelie', "I decided to take Monique's suggestion to heart and<br/>broach the subject of studying abroad to my parents.")

('Amelie', "If I pursue this path, it will take some time before I<br/>fully prove to them that I'm independent...")
('Amelie', "...but if it allows me to break free from their chains,<br/>then I'm willing to go the extra selge!")
('Amelie', 'If I can prove that I can go on trips by myself or live<br/>on my own, perhaps my parents will loosen their grip<br/>on me.')
('Amelie', "It's worth a try, at the very least. I'll only be able to<br/>break the status quo if I take action!")
('Amelie', "*sigh* My parents just don't get it.")
('Amelie', "Going to the movies doesn't get in the way of my<br/>studies whatsoever.")
('Amelie', "And it doesn't make me undignified or<br/>ungraceful, either. How could my parents say that?")
('Amelie', "Oh, right, I almost forgot that my old friend is<br/>back home. I haven't seen her in ages.")
('Amelie', "Seems like she's living her life the way she wants to...<br/>Maybe I can learn a thing or two from her when we<br/>get together.")
('Desiree', 'I had quite the scare last night.')
('Desiree', "A large man I've never seen before came into<br/>the theater. He was even more out of place than me<br/>and my generation.")
('Desiree', "He picked a seat very close to mine. I was so<br/>flabbergasted, I couldn't focus on the movie at all...")
('Desiree', "It's late, but maybe I'll catch one more film.")
('Desiree', "I've learned to appreciate each and every movie I see.<br/>They're all unique in their own little ways.")
('Desiree', "I still don't really know any of the actors' names or<br/>who's popular, but I understand why so many young<br/>people are drawn to them.")
('Desiree', 'Hmm? Could you be...?')
('Judith', 'Oh, uhh... Hi?<br/>(Crap. Has my cover been blown?!)')
('Desiree', 'Ah, I must be imagining things.')
('Desiree', "There's no way a famous actress would be walking<br/>around so openly in broad daylight.")
('Desiree', "I may have grown up on opera and theater, but I've<br/>become an avid fan of movies in recent years.")
('Desiree', 'I watched one on a whim when this movie theater<br/>had first been constructed, and to my surprise, it was<br/>an immensely enjoyable experience.')
('Desiree', "I've no knowledge on how movies are produced, but<br/>just seeing the pictures move is entertaining enough.")
('Bernice', 'Okay! Time to make some sales! I know things are<br/>rough right now, but if my two best friends can<br/>weather the storm, so can I!')
('Bernice', 'There are limits to what we can do on our own, but<br/>with a bit of support from friendly hands, we can<br/>accomplish anything!')
('Bernice', "I can only continue this bargain sale thanks to Emma,<br/>so I'm going to lift people's spirits by helping fill<br/>some bellies!")
('Bernice', "Emma's a real lifesaver. Thanks to her, we can keep<br/>selling our vegetables like we always have.")
('Bernice', "By the way, I noticed Timo's in high spirits tonight<br/>like usual.")
('Bernice', 'The locals are all acutely aware of her<br/>little...idiosyncrasy.')
('Bernice', "Welcome! I know things are tough out there, but you<br/>can't live on an empty stomach!")
('Bernice', "Business hasn't been great lately, so I decided to hold<br/>a bargain sale!")
('Bernice', 'Grab whatever vegetables you want before the prices<br/>go up! Come one, come all!')
('Bernice', 'One of my suppliers will be delivering more<br/>vegetables tonight, so get as much as you want!')
('Timo', "I-I got some fish in today. Please don't let them go<br/>to waste...")
('Timo', "There's leftover fish AGAIN?! I can't<br/>believe this!")
('Timo', "What the hell's the matter with you?! Why<br/>would you let fresh fish go to waste?!")
('Timo', "You better buy these up, sonny, or<br/>I'M GONNA LOSE IT!")
('Van', "(What's up with this lady? She wasn't like this<br/>earlier today.)")
('Van', "(What's up with this lady? Why's she freakin' out<br/>like this?)")
(15290, "Uh-oh. Old Lady Timo's raisin' a stink again, even<br/>though she sold a lot of fish today.")
(15291, "I bet the tourists are struck dumb. Though we're<br/>pretty used to this by now.")
('Timo', 'I swear, young folks these days waste SO<br/>much food!')
('Timo', 'I refuse to let my fish go unsold, damn it!')
('Timo', 'Umm... These fish were caught in Messeldam...<br/>Anyone want some...?')
('Timo', '*munch* Th-They just came in this morning...')
('Andy', "We have a good rep with the people who come here,<br/>but there are some who refuse to shop in<br/>this marketplace. It's tough.")
('Andy', 'Maybe I should head out to the capital during the<br/>Revolution Festival.')
('Andy', "I'll bet the people there are more open to uncommon<br/>foods, and if I'm right, I could grow my business<br/>through word of mouth.")
('Andy', "I'd also just like to help make the Revolution Festival<br/>as successful as possible, especially after the recent<br/>tragedy and all.")
('Andy', 'You hungry? How about trying one of my<br/>dinner dishes? My customers always love them!')
('Andy', '...The few I get, at least.')
('Andy', "I know there's a ton of hungry tourists out there, but<br/>this place just isn't well known.")
('Andy', "Anywho, why don't you grab a bite to eat? And if<br/>possible, I'd be pleased as punch if you spread<br/>the word.")
('Andy', "I learned in art school that getting people to<br/>recognize creative work is hard as heck, but I'm<br/>gonna keep at it.")
('Andy', "Thanks to the people in this market, I'm not in the<br/>red, so I'm going to work hard until I can ride a wave<br/>of momentum.")
('Andy', 'I thought the number of tourists would go down after<br/>the recent news, but I was dead wrong.')
('Andy', 'Anyway, can I interest you in some of my dishes?')
('Andy', "Oración's pretty well known for its royal cuisine, but<br/>arranged dishes have their appeal as well.")
('Andy', "You'd be surprised how a little mixing and matching<br/>can make a meal that much more delicious.")
('Andy', 'The extravagant royal cuisine and pot-au-feu are<br/>famous around these parts.')
('Andy', 'They serve as a strong base for my arrangements.')
('Andy', "I'll send your taste buds on an adventure!")
('Ungern', "Pershing was right. This guy's definitely an<br/>interesting one.")
('Ungern', "Meetings like this always make comin' to the<br/>Republic worthwhile.")
('Ungern', 'Would you happen to know Pershing from the<br/>exchange shop?')
('Ungern', "He's been helping me out with exporting antiques for<br/>a while now.")
('Ungern', "You guys should definitely make use of his services if<br/>you haven't already.")
('Ungern', 'Pershing made an odd request of me today.')
('Ungern', "He asked me to guide someone through the<br/>free cities. Said I could take him when I'm<br/>heading home.")
('Ungern', "Apparently he's a scrap dealer—and an interesting<br/>one, at that.")
('Ungern', "Hey. Lookin' for imported goods from the free cities?<br/>I've got stuff from Leman and Remiferia.")
('Ungern', "The Republic might be goin' through a rough patch,<br/>but we solo traders gotta keep goin'.")
('Ungern', "The flow of goods might dry up due to the state of<br/>emergency, so I'm here to help if that happens.")
('Ungern', 'I normally drop by the Republic once a month for a<br/>whole week, so I can accommodate you during<br/>that time.')
('Ungern', "I got here right before the incident, but business here<br/>hasn't changed one bit.")
('Ungern', "I hear everyone in the free cities is talkin' all about the<br/>terrorist attack...")
('Ungern', "But it feels like people here are treatin' it like it's<br/>some distant thing.")
('Jolanda', "I went to the orphanage earlier, but no one was there.<br/>Maybe they're on a field trip or something...")
('Jolanda', 'Guess I ought to leave them be for today. I can drop<br/>by some other time.')
('Jolanda', "I'd love to teach those kids how to make handicrafts.")
('Jolanda', "I've built up some confidence in my<br/>handicraft-making skills.")
('Jolanda', "If I can help put a smile on those kids' faces by<br/>teaching them, I'd be overjoyed.")
('Jolanda', 'I want those children to find something that brings<br/>them happiness in the future.')
('Jolanda', "At some point, I'd like to drop by the orphanage and<br/>teach the kids how to make accessories.")
('Jolanda', "They've been selling better than I anticipated, so I've<br/>gained a bit of confidence now.")
('Jolanda', 'Maybe I can help those kids find a path through life...')
('Jolanda', 'U-Umm... Excuse me? Would you like one of my<br/>handmade accessories?')
('Jolanda', "Not to toot my own horn, but people often say they're<br/>pretty cute...")
('Jolanda', "O-Oh, but you don't have to buy anything, of course!<br/>J-Just if you feel like it...")
('Jolanda', "I learned how to make arts and crafts at a<br/>gospel facility. I never thought it'd become<br/>my livelihood...")
('Jolanda', 'Locals and tourists alike have been buying them.<br/>It makes me so happy...and also a little embarrassed.')
('Westache', 'At last, my masterpiece is finally complete. I may not<br/>have got a wink of sleep, but sacrifices are oft a<br/>necessity for quality art.')
('Westache', 'Still, this is quite the ominous depiction of<br/>Vashtar Palace. I wonder why it turned out this way?')
('Westache', 'Perhaps it represents the dark history that lies within<br/>the shadows of the revolution. Yes, that must be it...')
('Westache', 'Well, I suppose I ought to get going. This will have<br/>all been for naught if I am tardy.')
('Westache', 'Curses! How could I have been so blind?!')
('Westache', "I've been staring at the palace all day, but I never took<br/>notice of the miasma that's flowing out of it!")
('Westache', 'Oh. Ooooh. YES! Inspiration has struck AT LAST!<br/>My hand is moving on its own!')
('Westache', 'Fare thee well, foul slump! My inner artist has<br/>finally emerged! Haha!')
('Westache', 'Confound it all! My focus is in tatters due to<br/>that incident.')
('Westache', "And at such a critical juncture, too! I can't fall into a<br/>slump with this deadline looming over my head!")
('Westache', "I'll simply have to push myself a little harder... No, I'll<br/>stare at the palace till sunset if I must!")
('Westache', 'There are many art and music schools here<br/>in Oración. My generation has a duty to inherit the<br/>traditional arts from our forefathers.')
('Westache', "I must live up to everyone's lofty expectations of me,<br/>but every time my mind wanders back to that tragedy,<br/>my hand freezes.")
('Westache', 'Why must inspiration elude me so?!')
('Fia', "I certainly wasn't expecting these surprise festivities.<br/>They must be trying to cheer us up.")
('Fia', "I left my daughter behind in the South District.<br/>She's with a nice guide lady, so I'm sure she'll be fine.")
('Fia', "I want my little Teto to have a great time. These sorts<br/>of opportunities don't come along every day.")
('Fia', 'That incident should serve as a reminder that we all<br/>need to live every day to the fullest.')
('Fia', 'We should make the most out of every moment that<br/>passes us by. Life is precious, but also fleeting.')
('Fia', "Okay, that's enough philosophizing for one day.<br/>Time to buy some groceries so I can make delicious<br/>food for my darling daughter!")
('Teto', "There's gotta be something fun to do around here.<br/>I know there's a movie theater somewhere...")
('Teto', 'I like shopping with Mommy, but I do that every day.<br/>I wanna shake things up!')
('Monique', "Living on my own and going on trips has helped me<br/>expand my horizons, and it's helped me discover so<br/>many new hobbies.")
('Monique', "And now that I'm back home, I'm viewing it with a<br/>whole different lens. It's fascinating, really.")
('Monique', 'Your parents are as strict as ever.')
('Monique', "But I'm glad to hear you're into movies now.")
('Monique', "Sucks to hear they're shaming you for watching them,<br/>but I doubt they'll stop you, at least.")
('Amelie', "Yes, but I imagine they'll continue to make a fuss<br/>of it. They may even force me to go to the opera<br/>house with them to compensate.")
('Amelie', "They've always been adamant about giving me a<br/>'proper cultural education.'")
('Monique', "Overbearing parents are the worst, aren't they?<br/>Why not get away from them for a while? Maybe you<br/>could go on a trip or try moving out.")
('Monique', 'Traveling alone can be scary at first, but you also get<br/>to discover so many things about the world<br/>and yourself.')
('Monique', "But most importantly, doing that will show them<br/>you're independent—and I bet they'll start laying off a<br/>little afterwards.")
('Amelie', "Huh. You know, that just might work. It'd also be<br/>nice to add traveling to my growing list of<br/>new hobbies.")
('Amelie', "The problem is... I'd probably need an excuse to travel<br/>and live out on my own.")
('Amelie', "Hmm... Perhaps I could say I'm doing a homestay<br/>program while studying abroad.")
('Emma', 'There are people here that depend on this market.')
('Emma', "I don't know what'll happen to the Republic going<br/>forward, but we have to continue offering Ored's<br/>crops at the current price.")
('Emma', "Okay, so you need one extra barrel of potatoes in next<br/>month's delivery...")
('Emma', "Any other changes? Or is there something I can help<br/>you with? Business discussions hit a stopping point,<br/>so I'm free for the night.")
('Bernice', "No, no. You've done more than enough for<br/>me already.")
('Bernice', "Honestly, I'm impressed you do business with such<br/>large companies. And yet you go out of your way for<br/>my little stall on top of that.")
('Emma', 'We all have to look out for one another. Things seem<br/>rough around here, so I want to chip in where I can.')
('Emma', 'I know you lost one of our suppliers in that<br/>terrorist attack...')
('Bernice', 'Yes... I knew those villagers well.')
('Bernice', "It's just so tragic. So many people lost their lives...")
('Emma', 'I know... But we just have to keep at it. People are<br/>depending on us to get them their goods.')
('Bernice', "You're absolutely right. We need to keep doing what<br/>we always do so everyone can eat their fill!")
('Director Flona', "I can't believe they got invited to a special event<br/>like this. This must be the Goddess at work.")
('Director Flona', 'I hope everyone enjoys themselves.')
('Director Flona', "They'll be able to see just how vast the world is—and<br/>they can spend some time with other kids as well.")
('Director Flona', "Oh, hello, Van. I'm happy to see you again.")
('Director Flona', 'Heehee. I know we only just saw each other earlier<br/>today, but it feels like so much time has passed<br/>since then.')
('Director Flona', 'Is there something I can help you with?')
('Van', "Nah, just checkin' in. I'm glad all looks well.")
('Director Flona', "My, you've grown into such a considerate young man.")
('Director Flona', 'Anyway, yes, both the children and I have been doing<br/>just fine as of late.')
('Director Flona', 'Thanks to those donations, the kids have been able to<br/>enjoy their lives comfortably.')
('Van', "...That's good to hear.")
('Agnès', "(Van looks like he's okay, but deep down, I think he's<br/>only just barely keeping it together.)")
('Agnès', '(I have to find a way to get these people to safety—<br/>like a fixer would.)')
('Director Flona', "The kids can't sleep since they're so excited.<br/>They aren't used to surprise visitors.")
('Director Flona', "I'm sure they'd love it if you talked to them.")
('Director Flona', "I'm so glad you came to visit us.")
('Director Flona', "I certainly didn't expect it.")
('Van', "Can't say I saw it coming, either. Glad I dropped<br/>by, though.")
('Van', "It's good to see that things are same old, same old<br/>around here. 'Cept for you bein' director, of course.")
('Van', 'Wait... What happened to Director Arkride, anyway?')
('Director Flona', "Sadly, he passed on a few years ago. He's with the<br/>Goddess now.")
('Director Flona', "He left this place to me, and I've been running it<br/>ever since.")
('Director Flona', "Although, I don't know if I'm doing as good a<br/>job as him...")
('Van', "Well, for my money, I think you're doin' him proud.")
('Van', "Looking at the kids' beaming faces makes that clear<br/>as day.")
('Director Flona', 'Heehee. It means a lot to hear you say that, Van.')
('Director Flona', "Well, I won't keep you. I know you have important<br/>business to attend to.")
('Director Flona', "Just know you're welcome here anytime. I'd love to sit<br/>down and catch up with you sometime.")
('Van', "Thanks. I'll do my best to make sure that happens.")
('Agnès', '(This place is so important to him...)')
('Director Flona', 'I know you have something you must take care of.')
('Director Flona', "Though if you ever get the chance, we'd love to have<br/>you here.")
('Director Flona', "There is much I'd like to talk to you about.")
('Sophie', "We don't get chances like this very often, so I say we<br/>make the most of it!")
('Sophie', "But I'll have to keep an eye on Todd and Rinka so<br/>they don't get lost.")
('Sophie', "It's good that those two get to experience something<br/>like this.")
('Sophie', "Though, umm, I guess this is a first for me, too...<br/>I'm pretty stoked for this.")
('Sophie', 'Oh, hi. Are you here to talk with Ms. Flona?')
('Sophie', "Don't mind me. I'm just reading my book.")
('Sophie', 'I enjoy reading recipe books so I can help Ms. Flona<br/>with cooking.')
('Sophie', "It'd be nice if Jean took a page out of my book and<br/>helped her with chores...but I guess he has his hands<br/>full with Todd and his job.")
('Sophie', "Todd and Jean are wide awake, but Rinka's<br/>dead tired.")
('Sophie', "Guess it's time to put the book away and get those<br/>two knuckleheads to settle down. Otherwise, Rinka<br/>won't get a wink of sleep.")
('Sophie', "I'd like to hear about what the orphanage was like<br/>back when you grew up here.")
('Sophie', 'Ms. Flona talks about the old director sometimes.<br/>He sounded so cool!')
('Sophie', "Thanks for before, Grampy. I swear, Jean's got more<br/>energy than he knows what to do with.")
('Sophie', 'Come on now, Jean. Say thank you to Grampy.')
('Jean', 'I-I was just about do that! Thanks a bunch, Grampy.')
('Van', "Urgh. I'm being gaslit here.")
('Van', 'Just call me Van. Or big bro, if you want.')
('Jean', 'By the way, Grampy. You know Ms. Flona, right?')
('Sophie', "Weren't you listening to them, too? Ms. Flona said<br/>Grampy grew up here!")
('Jean', "For real?! Wow, that means we're orphanage buddies!<br/>Now you gotta play with us!")
('Van', "I'll consider it—but I ain't doin' nothing if you keep<br/>calling me that.")
('Van', '(These kids are so full of life...)')
('Agnès', '(Van...)')
('Jean', 'This is AWESOME!')
('Jean', "I was planning to use my part-time pay on something<br/>like this, but now I don't have to!")
('Jean', 'This is gonna be a blast!')
('Jean', "I can't wait to see the look on Todd's face!")
('Jean', "I'm not sleepy at all, but if I don't get some rest,<br/>delivering all those papers tomorrow is gonna be a<br/>pain in the rear.")
('Jean', "I think I'll just play some card games or something<br/>until I'm feeling tired.")
('Jean', "...Man, I sure am lucky. Got a job, some good friends,<br/>and a nice, warm bed. I've kinda got it made, huh?")
('Jean', 'Maybe I could make myself useful at night.<br/>My buddy Pino does some shoe shining around<br/>this time.')
('Jean', "Sophie says I oughta be more responsible, but I'm the<br/>one with a job!")
('Jean', "When I have a boatload of money saved up, she won't<br/>be saying that anymore!")
('Jean', 'Delivering newspapers is a bunch of fun. I get to ride<br/>around the whole city and make tons of friends.')
('Rinka', 'Everyone looks excited...')
('Rinka', '...and that makes me feel excited, too.')
('Rinka', 'Oh... You came back like you promised.')
('Rinka', 'I was gonna sleep, but do you wanna talk?')
('Rinka', 'I have nice dreams when I sleep with everyone else...<br/>So I like sleeping.')
('Rinka', 'When I first came here, I had a lot of sad dreams, so<br/>sleeping was scary...')
('Rinka', "Please don't go...")
('Rinka', 'Ms. Flona wants to talk to you more...')
('Rinka', '...and I want to, too.')
('Rinka', 'I dunno where Mommy went...')
('Rinka', "But everyone here is really nice to me, and it's<br/>warm here. So I'm okay.")
('Todd', "I can't wait, I can't WAIT!")

('Bracer Kazan', 'As it happens, a few people from my village ended up<br/>becoming jaegers like them.')
('Bracer Kazan', "If even half the stories they've told me are true, then I<br/>can believe they're the strongest corps.")

('Bracer Xiaoling', "Now you've got me worried. I hope they don't end up<br/>crossing paths with Zin's team.")
('Bracer Xiaoling', "I'm really worried about how this death game is going<br/>to turn out.")
('Bracer Kazan', "Hopefully it'll all end okay. I'm still surprised they<br/>even bothered coming all the way out here.")
('Bracer Kazan', "Wait a minute. Is it possible that thing I sensed in<br/>Longlai was... No, I shouldn't be thinking about this.")
('Bracer Kazan', "Of all the Eastern jaeger corps that could've come<br/>here, it just had to be Ikaruga. This sucks big time.")

('Filenkov', "Haha. I'm sure the kids are doing just fine. I'll be<br/>home by the Revolution Festival, anyway.")
('Filenkov', 'But first, I need to get my hands on some of those<br/>antiques over in the free cities.')
('Filenkov', "You've worked with traders in the free cities before,<br/>haven't you?")
('Filenkov', 'I was just thinking that my trip there would go much<br/>more smoothly if I had a guide.')
('Pershing', 'You asking me to act as an intermediary? Sure, I can<br/>handle that.')
('Pershing', 'In fact, I know a guy who can help you out.')
('Ungern', "So you're the guy who Pershing was talkin' about.<br/>You wanna come with me to the free cities?")
('Filenkov', "That's right. The name's Filenkov, and I'll go<br/>anywhere that has rare knickknacks to be found.")
('Filenkov', 'A little birdie told me some antique parts from the<br/>Middle Ages are being dug up in the free cities as<br/>we speak!')
('Filenkov', 'I just must go see them with my own eyes!')
('Ungern', "...You're pretty passionate about this, aren't you?")
('Ungern', 'I can see that little twinkle in your eye. You look like<br/>a kid in a candy store.')
('Filenkov', "My apologies if my excitement was a tad off-putting.<br/>People often tell me my curiosity's like that of<br/>a child.")
('Ungern', "I can see why, but I don't think that's a bad thing.<br/>I'm sure this'll make for a fun trip.")
('Ungern', "I'm only gonna guide you part of the way there, so if<br/>you're fine with that, then let's get goin'.")
('Barton', "Now that these two are okay, I'm going to get back<br/>to work.")
('Barton', "I'll need to reflect on my mistakes so that this never<br/>happens again.")
('Barton', 'Thank you so much, everyone!')
('Barton', "I can't believe I lost track of those tourists!")
('Barton', 'I have to do something, and quick!')
('Barton', 'I really hope they accept my request...')
(15293, "*sigh* I can't believe they got so angry just because I<br/>saw their faces...")
(15293, 'Those guys were terrifying, but we got through it,<br/>thanks to you guys.')
(15293, "I'll make sure to take the warnings of tour guides<br/>seriously from now on.")
(15294, "What the heck is 'airsoft,' anyway?")
(15294, "Doesn't sound like a fun sport to me.")
(15294, 'Those guys were like jaegers, so I guess we should<br/>count ourselves lucky that we made it out safe<br/>and sound.')
(15294, "I can't believe we did something so stupid. We only<br/>came here to enjoy ourselves...")
(15292, '*sigh* Officer Crema is supposed to be on duty<br/>right now.')
(15292, 'She said she had urgent business to attend to and<br/>went off somewhere.')
(15292, "I haven't heard from her since then. I sure hope<br/>she's okay.")
('Shizuna', "There're a lot of powerful players here. We've got the<br/>mafia, the Gardens, and all these other<br/>random groups.")
('Shizuna', "Heehee. We have our work cut out for us, don't we?")
('Kurogane', 'On the contrary, I believe we could have this whole<br/>ordeal settled by the end of the day.')
('Kurogane', 'But I assume you wish to use this rare opportunity to<br/>determine what direction this continent is headed.')
('Shizuna', "Yep. Plus I'll bet there's gonna be a lot of fun<br/>surprises by the end, so we should let this show run<br/>its course.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Can't say I'm thrilled about havin' another run-in<br/>with that freak from the Gardens...")
('Walter the Direwolf', "...but I'm still psyched as hell for this thing.<br/>That Dantès guy sure knows how to throw a party.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "Well, good host or not, that man is a<br/>veritable monster. He's almost as bad as our friend in<br/>the silly blue coat.")
('Harwood', "Hey, now. I resent that. I'll have you know I'm a<br/>model gentleman.")
('Harwood', "One thing's for certain, though. This is going to be a<br/>festival to remember.")
('Dantès', 'These ruins have existed since the days when this<br/>country was a kingdom—and when this city was<br/>its capital.')
('Dantès', 'They shall serve as the arena for our game. Once you<br/>have bathed in the blood of your peers, you will earn<br/>the right to challenge one of my pawns.')
('Dantès', 'Should you take all of my pieces, the last team<br/>standing will have the opportunity to checkmate me<br/>here in Vashtar Palace.')
('Dantès', 'That is the long and short of it.')
('Aaron', 'He wants us to duke it out in a battle royale?!')
('Judith', "They must be sick in the head if they think we'll play<br/>along with this insanity—")
('Dantès', 'Ah! I should mention that participation is<br/>compulsory, so I would not skip out on this if I<br/>were you.')
('Dantès', 'That is, if you value your own lives—as well as those<br/>of the 280,000 innocents in this city.')
('Judith', '...?!')
('Agnès', "Th-That's a nuclear weapon!")
('Feri', 'Just like the one that destroyed Creil...')
('Van', 'They had another one of those damn things after all.')
('Quatre', "That must be the last of Professor Callaghan's<br/>incomplete prototypes.")
('Dantès', "I trust that an explanation of this device's capabilities<br/>is unnecessary.")
('Dantès', 'This game has a number of rules that govern<br/>participation, the evacuation of civilians, and other<br/>such matters.')
('Dantès', 'Should anyone break the rules, the device will<br/>instantly detonate, sending everyone straight to the<br/>afterlife, whether that be heaven or Gehenna.')
('Dantès', 'Rule violations will be assessed on a case-by-case<br/>basis by an impartial surveillance system, which is run<br/>by this relic.')
('Agnès', 'The sixth Genesis!')
('Risette', 'We knew it would be involved in some manner.')
('Dantès', "The device's judgment is absolute. Do not think you<br/>can pull the wool over its all-seeing eye.")
('Dantès', 'Should you wish to face me in battle, you must<br/>eliminate the other teams and conquer the game.<br/>It really is that simple.')
('Dantès', 'I do hope you will enjoy this carnival that we have<br/>dutifully prepared. I know that I will.')
('Van', "Figured I'd find you here.")
('Van', "Hey, c'mon! At least hear me out, will ya?")
('Van', 'As you can see, I came alone, and no one<br/>followed me. I just wanna chat. Promise.')
('Elaine', '...')
('Elaine', 'All right, then.')
('Elaine', 'I thought maybe Zin had asked you to come and<br/>get me.')
('Elaine', 'So, how did you know to find me here?')
('Van', "'Cause back when we were little, you'd always come<br/>to this spot whenever you got upset.")
('Van', "Might've been fifteen years ago, but I still remember<br/>that clear as day.")
('Elaine', '...')
('Van', "Also, I'm the hide-and-seek master, remember? I beat<br/>you every time when we played it as kids.")
('Elaine', "...You're going to hold that over my head for the rest<br/>of my life, aren't you?")
('Van', "Of course. What're friends for?")
('Elaine', 'Now, you had something you wanted to say to<br/>me, right? Out with it, then.')
('Van', "Actually, I had a lot I wanted to say to you, but...now<br/>I'm having second thoughts about whether I should<br/>lay it all out.")
('Elaine', "Are you holding back because...I'm annoying to<br/>deal with?")
('Van', 'I mean, you can be a handful sometimes...')
('Van', "Sorry, sorry. What I meant was...I just think I'm<br/>gonna have trouble getting through to you right now.")
('Van', "Once you've set your mind to something, no one—<br/>not even Aidios Herself—can do anything to get you<br/>to change course.")
('Van', "That's always how you've been. Stubborn to a fault.")
('Elaine', 'That makes two of us.')
('Van', "Yeah, but you're a special case...in more ways<br/>than one.")
('Van', "You're the daughter of the biggest family in the entire<br/>region—and you were always off playin' with some<br/>problematic, orphaned punk.")
('Van', "Then you left for Aramis and became its Student<br/>Council president, but after graduation, you went<br/>against your dad's wishes and joined the guild.")
('Van', 'And from there, you went on to make great strides as<br/>a bracer and reached A-rank in no time flat—and<br/>here you are now, running off on your own.')
('Van', "You're a model student at heart, but you've got one<br/>hell of a rebellious streak.")
('Elaine', 'I wonder where I got that from? Oh, right.<br/>It was the troublemaking delinquent who<br/>corrupted me from a young age.')
('Elaine', "Everything that's gone wrong in my life traces back<br/>to you.")
('Van', 'Pinning it all on me, huh?')
('Elaine', "And why wouldn't I? You're the very reason I became<br/>estranged from my father in the first place.")
('Elaine', "He was behind your sudden disappearance fourteen<br/>years ago, wasn't he?")
('Elaine', "Your 'adoption' was arranged by him personally.<br/>He sent you away—just to force you out of my life.")
('Elaine', 'And then...you...')
('Van', '...')
('Van', "...You're right. It's all my fault.")
('Elaine', 'Exactly. I blame you for everything.')
('Elaine', "...I'm sorry. I don't know why I'm taking this out<br/>on you.")
('Elaine', 'You did nothing wrong. I know full well the fault lies<br/>squarely with me.')
('Elaine', "I'm sorry. I'm so sorry... Please forgive me.")
('Van', "No. I won't.")
('Elaine', '...')
('Van', "And that's because you had it right the first time.<br/>It's not your fault—it's mine.")
('Van', 'I wrecked your life—I drove it right off the rails and<br/>sent it careening off the cliff. Even now, my presence<br/>is making it spiral further down...')
('Elaine', 'What do you mean by that?')
('Van', "You can lift the guilt off your shoulders and pile the<br/>blame on mine. If that puts you at ease, then I'll<br/>gladly carry it for you, Lainey.")
('Van', "If you can't rely on the pampered prince or the guild,<br/>you can always turn to me. That's what I'm here fo—")
('Elaine', 'There you go again.')
('Elaine', "I'm not going to do that to you, Van.")
('Elaine', "I would never put that on your shoulders. You're<br/>already carrying so much.")
('Van', "But I'm not—")
('Elaine', "Yes, you are. You're holding the weight of<br/>everyone's expectations. My guildmates, René, and...<br/>even the society are all counting on you.")
('Elaine', 'And I am as well.')
('Elaine', 'This twisted game will come to a head tomorrow, and<br/>you and your friends are the only ones who can put an<br/>end to it.')
('Elaine', 'So put me out of your mind. You have more<br/>important things to be worrying about right now.')
('Van', '...')
('Elaine', "I'm quite used to handling my problems on my own,<br/>so don't worry about me.")
('Elaine', "Also, if you're thinking of telling me to lean on<br/>someone else, don't. I won't hear it—not until you<br/>can practice what you preach.")
('Elaine', "Tomorrow will be a big day for both of us. I'm going<br/>to try and get some rest, and I suggest you do<br/>the same.")
('Elaine', 'And for the time being...I need you to keep being the<br/>person whom I can place my frustrations on.')
('Van', 'Elaine, I—')
('Van', '...What the hell am I even doing?')
('Van', "The view from here's the same as it always was.<br/>Guess some things never change.")
('Agnès', "*pant* *pant* We're...alive, aren't we?")
('Feri', 'I-I think so...')
('Aaron', 'Why in the HELL did you think that was a<br/>good idea?! Are you some kinda maniac?')
('Van', "Maniac or not, we're alive, so yeah, I think it was a<br/>solid plan.")
('Risette', 'My attempt to soften our landing with shards<br/>proved successful.')
('Quatre', "*pant* I wish you remembered that some of us aren't<br/>the athletic type...")
('Judith', 'That was AWESOME! It felt like we were acting<br/>out the climax of a movie or something.')
('Bergard', "Heh. As long as everyone is alive and well, I<br/>won't complain.")
('Agnès', "It's finally over...")
('Van', "Yeah. We've closed the books on this case.")
('Van', 'Though we still have plenty of work ahead of us.<br/>And the lives Almata stole will never be returned...')
('Van', "...but I think we've paid back the debt we owed those<br/>people and then some. For now, that's good enough<br/>for me.")
('Aaron', 'I was finally able to avenge my bros.')
('Feri', "Yeah. I hope Aida's smiling from up above.")
('Fie', "I'm sure she is.")
('Quatre', 'Maybe the people of Basel can rest easy now.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Oh! Hey, you guys!')
('Elaine', 'Is everyone okay?!')
('Renne', "It looks like they're all in one piece, at least.")
('Agnès', 'Renne! Elaine! Marielle!')
('Van', 'Here comes the welcome wagon.')
('Zin the Immovable', "Things are gonna get pretty busy around these parts,<br/>but if we work together, we'll be done in no time.")
('Van', "Huh?! Who's 'we'?!")
('Fie', "Don't be like that. We have a lot of cleanup to do,<br/>and you're helping.")
('Fie', "Think of it as helping out Elaine. She's going to be<br/>busier than any of us.")
('Van', "Guess that's true.")
('Van', "Fine, you win. We'll do what we can.")
('Agnès', 'Heehee. Compared to dismantling the mafia, cleanup<br/>should be a walk in the park.')
('Cao', "We shall excuse ourselves. I'm sure we will meet again<br/>soon enough.")
('Rixia', "It was a pleasure to fight alongside you all. I'll see you<br/>again soon, Judith.")
('Judith', 'Yeah. See you.')
('Aaron', "With Almata out of the picture, Heiyue's gonna be<br/>pretty damn busy.")
('Van', 'Yeah, but you know Cao. He and the Lu family can<br/>handle just about anything.')
('Feri', 'Wait, what happened to Shizuna and Kurogane?!')
('Agnès', 'They were just here a moment ago...')
('Van', "Disappeared the moment they finished their job.<br/>That's shinobi for you.")
('Shizuna', "It's been a while since I had that much fun.")
('Shizuna', "And if we take the timetable of our main contract<br/>into account, I'd say this wild ride's barely<br/>gotten started.")
('Kurogane', "Indeed. Everything hinges on the president's<br/>future orders.")
('Kurogane', 'We have disposed of the boat and can retreat at<br/>any time.')
('Shizuna', "Okay, then. Let's skedaddle. See you<br/>around, spriggan.")
('Feri', 'Wait, what happened to the Enforcers?!')
('Agnès', 'They were just here a moment ago...')
('Van', "They've finished what they set out to do.<br/>Guessin' they wanted to peace out before the CID<br/>shows up.")
('Van', "And good riddance... Wait. Where's our pay?")
('Risette', 'Now that you mention it, we never got around to<br/>discussing payment details with them.')
('Quatre', 'Perhaps it would be best to let this one go...')
('Van', 'Oh, HELL no! Give me my damn money, you<br/>scamming assholes!')
('Harwood', "Heheh. Good work, you two. We've already wired<br/>the mira to them, but I couldn't pass up the<br/>opportunity to see them squirm.")
('Harwood', "He may still blow a fuse when he learns I paid below<br/>his rates. Though he did enlist our help, so it's<br/>only fair.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'Heehee. You are such a stingy old man. Can you not<br/>throw the poor things a bone?')
('Walter the Direwolf', "He's probably just pissed that they ruined all the prep<br/>work he did.")
('Harwood', 'Not at all. This ended up being an oddly invigorating<br/>experience for me.')

('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'Anyway, what should we do from here? We were<br/>unable to recover those artifacts.')
('Dominion Celis', "Ugh. Don't remind me. Guess I oughta hit up the<br/>CID's chief and see what our next move is.")
('General Manager Thorndyke', 'I suppose we can call this a job well done.')
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', 'Indeed. We met all of the objectives that were issued<br/>to us by the president.')
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', "However, our main AI's predicted danger level<br/>remains the same...")
('General Manager Thorndyke', "It should have changed by now, but it's still showing<br/>as yellow.")
('General Manager Thorndyke', 'We must remain vigilant as we wait for the grand<br/>reveal next month.')
('Ashladd', 'Most of our primary objectives have<br/>been accomplished. However, I regret to inform you<br/>that the overseer of the thorns managed to escape.')
('Ashladd', 'I must also apologize about the matter related to the<br/>dark blue core.')

('Jean', 'Aaah!')
('Van', 'Crap.')
('Jean', 'Phew. Close call.')
('Van', 'Gotta be more careful, kiddo.')

('Sophie', 'Thanks for catching him, Grampy!')
('Van', "...Don't call me that.")
('Jean', 'Yeah! I owe you big time, Grampy!')
('Van', '...')
('Jean', 'Wanna play with us? We can play tag, hide and<br/>seek, or...')

('Jean', 'Yes, you do! Old people always have lots of free time!')
('Van', "I ain't takin' this crap.")
('Quatre', "They're cute, aren't they?")
('Agnès', "Very much so. I'm glad he wasn't hurt.")
('Feri', "Seeing them reminds me of my little brother<br/>and sister. They're adorable.")
('Todd', "You're funny, Grampy!")
('Rinka', 'Can you play with us? Pretty pleaaase?')
('Van', "What the...? Where'd you two come from?!")
('Risette', "They've really taken a liking to him, haven't they?")
('Judith', "They're practically swarming him.")
('Aaron', "Well, aren't you Mister Popular, G R A M P Y?")
('Van', 'You shut your mouth!')

('Agnès', 'So Van grew up here?')
('Aaron', "This job's been one big homecoming for you,<br/>hasn't it? No wonder you've been looking all<br/>sentimental this whole time.")
('Van', "I have NOT been lookin' sentimental!")
('Quatre', "I'm guessing he lived here until he became an adult?")
('Director Flona', 'No, he left Oración long before that. Someone from<br/>far away adopted him.')
('Director Flona', 'If memory serves, that was about fourteen years ago.')
('Director Flona', 'I was just a supporting caregiver back then.<br/>Director Arkride was the one in charge.')
('Feri', 'Arkride?!')
('Risette', "So that's where your surname comes from.")
('Van', "Yep. Didn't feel like wastin' time thinking up a name,<br/>so I just went with the first one that came to mind.")
('Aaron', '(Hmm...)')

('Director Flona', 'Young Van was always the center of attention, and he<br/>got along very well with children outside<br/>the orphanage.')

('Director Flona', "Have you all had lunch yet? You're more than<br/>welcome to join us if you haven't.")
('Agnès', "It's lovely of you to offer...")
('Van', "...but we've got something we gotta take care of.")
('Director Flona', "That's too bad... Perhaps next time, then.")
('Van', "Oh, one more thing. You aren't havin' any trouble<br/>running the place, right? Any money woes?")
('Director Flona', 'None whatsoever, thankfully.')
('Director Flona', 'The cathedral is close, so people from the church do a<br/>lot to help us.')
('Director Flona', 'We also receive a large donation from an anonymous<br/>benefactor every year.')

('Van', "Sorry, kiddos. It ain't easy bein' an adult.<br/>Lotta responsibilities.")
('Van', "Y'all do me a favor: play your little hearts out while<br/>you're still a kid—or you'll regret it later.")
('Todd', 'Okay! I hope we can play with you sometime, too!')
('Rinka', "You'll come back, right, mister?")
('Van', '...Sure. At some point.')
('Van', "I'll get out of your hair now. We'll be in the city for<br/>another few days, so we'll try and come back before<br/>we leave.")

('Agnès', '...Huh?')
('Harwood', "Haha. Now that's a silly question.")
('Harwood', "Allow me to let you in on a little secret: I'm always up<br/>to something.")
('Van', 'Okay, let me rephrase.')
('Van', "What's your real reason for not fightin' with us?")
('Harwood', 'Oh? Did Renne give you a word of warning about<br/>me, perhaps?')
('Harwood', 'And here I was thinking she took a liking to me.<br/>Unlike the professor, I was reasonably nice to her<br/>when she was a child.')
('Van', "If you thought you could fool Renne with fake smiles<br/>and honeyed words, then you clearly didn't know her.")
('Van', "And you can't fool me, either. You're setting up some<br/>kinda trap in the underground, aren't you?")
('Harwood', '...')
('Feri', 'Wait, really?')
('Quatre', 'The only abnormality FIO picked up was the<br/>presence of the higher elements.')
('Van', "I'm not exactly sure what stunt you're pullin' here...")
('Van', "...but I'm on to you. We know that most groups<br/>that've opposed you got silenced—permanently.")
('Van', "Their cases were labeled as 'accidents,' 'resulting from<br/>internal conflict,' and other things of that nature.")
('Van', "If you don't have some kind of superpower, there<br/>aren't many ways you could pull off something<br/>like that.")
('Van', "That's why I'm thinkin' you're using some kind of<br/>unknown bacteria or virus—or an untraceable poison.")
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Heh.')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'Oh, my.')
('Harwood', '...')
('Judith', "He's using WHAT?!")
('Quatre', 'So he possesses biological and chemical weapons...')
('Risette', 'Those are illegal under international law.')
('Harwood', "Heheh. That nose of yours really is something,<br/>isn't it?")
('Harwood', 'I do indeed use both, but I prefer the<br/>chemical variety. Biological weapons are harder<br/>to handle.')

('Harwood', 'Though that was never a concern of mine. After all,<br/>I am the Oathbreaker. Breaking oaths and rules is<br/>what I do.')
('Harwood', "And you can't deny it's the most effective way to win<br/>the game. I'm taking out all the players—and the<br/>organizers—in one fell swoop.")
('Harwood', "I'll spare you alone. That's your reward for figuring<br/>out my plan. You can run along back to the city and<br/>take care of requests while we wrap this up.")
('Harwood', 'Not a bad deal, huh?')

('Van', "...is what I'd like to say, but you and I both know that<br/>the rules are the only reason why you're leaving them<br/>out of this.")
('Harwood', 'Heh. I make decisions like that on a<br/>case-by-case basis.')
('Van', "All right, I've heard enough. I want you outta this<br/>game right NOW!")
('Harwood', 'Sure thing.')
('Harwood', 'The Fourth Anguis of the Society of Ouroboros<br/>hereby withdraws his registration from the game.')
('System', "Registration of Team Arkride Solutions member<br/>'The Thousand Oathbreaker' has been withdrawn.<br/>They may no longer interfere with the game.")
('Van', 'Wha...?')
('Aaron', 'WHAT?!')
('Walter the Direwolf', "You son of a... Not even gonna let your teammates<br/>weigh in on your decisions before you make 'em?")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "Oh, dear. Now he can't use any of his nasty tricks<br/>on anyone.")
('Agnès', 'Wh-Why did you give up so readily?')
('Risette', "This must be yet another part of his scheme. I'm sure<br/>of it.")
('Harwood', "Nope, you're wrong.")
('Harwood', "Renne might've given you a push in the right<br/>direction, but the fact that you caught me in the act<br/>is impressive. Consider this your reward.")
('Harwood', "Hope you weren't counting on my help.")
('Van', "I mean, I kinda wanted you as a last resort in case<br/>things went awry, but you clearly aren't worth<br/>the risk.")
('Van', "Better not try to go lookin' for loopholes, you hear?")
('Harwood', 'Damn. There goes that plan.')
('Harwood', "Oh, well. Nothing left to do but kick back and think<br/>up my next crime. Maybe I'll try one that spans both<br/>the orbal net and the real world.")
('Quatre', "(Sh-Should we, umm...pretend we didn't hear that?)")
('Bergard', "(We'll worry about him later. For now, we should just<br/>be thankful Van thwarted his plan before it claimed<br/>any lives.)")
(40301, "She's amazing!")
(40302, 'Dance some more!')
('Feri', 'Okie doke! One more time!')
('Aaron', 'Look at small fry go.')
('Quatre', "She's quite good.")
('Risette', 'If memory serves, she learned how to dance from Ms.<br/>Shaheena in Tharbad.')
('Judith', 'Well, color me impressed.')
('Judith', "She's got everyone's attention. I bet she'd have pretty<br/>good screen presence if she decided to take up acting.")
('Van', 'I can see that.')
('Van', "Anyway, I have no idea what she's up to, but there's<br/>no reason to interfere.")
('Bergard', "Agreed. Let's be on our way.")
(40301, "Whoa! He's so cool!")
(40302, "And he's hot, too...")
('Aaron', 'Feast your eyes on me. Consider this a special treat!')
('Quatre', 'What sort of dance is that?')
('Feri', "It's called sword dancing. He performed this at the<br/>Eastern Theater in Langport.")
('Judith', "I've heard all about it from other people, but seeing it<br/>in person is just...wow.")
('Quatre', 'Oh. He blew a kiss at one of the women passing by.')
('Risette', 'And now young women are gathering to see the<br/>spectacle as well.')
('Van', "Is he really doin' his usual bit in front of the kids?<br/>What the hell's he up to?")
('Bergard', "Hard to say. Perhaps he is acting in accordance to<br/>Agnès' plan.")
('Van', "Maybe, yeah. Well, if he's helpin' her, then we can<br/>leave him be.")
('Quatre', 'XEROS, do a handstand!')
('XEROS', 'RUFF!')
(40302, 'Whoaaa!')
(40301, "The robo doggie's actually doing a handstand!")
('Aaron', "That's hilarious.")
('Feri', "No, it's awesome! I didn't know Quatre taught<br/>them that.")
('Risette', "Actually, it'd be more accurate to say he programmed<br/>them to perform that action.")
('Judith', "Either way, it's impressive.")
('Judith', "Never say you can't teach an old dog new tricks...or a<br/>robot dog in this case.")
('Van', 'Goes to show that even a genius like him has a<br/>playful side.')
('Risette', "It's quite charming.")
('Van', "Anyway, I have no idea what he's up to, but there's no<br/>reason to interfere.")
('Bergard', "Agreed. Let's be on our way.")
('Agnès', 'This request is...alarming.')
('Van', 'Yeah. We better look into it.')
(40301, "Huh? There's some kind of gathering over there.")
(40301, 'I wonder what it is.')
(40301, 'Oh, two students from the music academy<br/>are performing!')
(40301, 'And one of them is Central Eastern.')
('Van', "So here's the plan: we're gonna use decoys to lure<br/>'em out.")
('Van', "We'll need you and Amalie to perform on the street.")
('Nelly', "Wait, you're using me as a decoy?")
('Judith', "So that's what you meant by 'something that'll really<br/>rile 'em up.'")
('Quatre', "I imagine that'll be effective in drawing them out of<br/>the shadows. However, I don't know how we'll tell<br/>them apart.")
('Aaron', "Also, we can't corner them without any proof.")
('Van', "I know. And that's where the third decoy comes in.")
('Van', "I'm thinkin' our perp is using the survey to find<br/>people who are pro-immigration.")
('Van', 'They might even have a running list of targets.')
('Van', "So if someone was cheerin' Nelly on, they might<br/>make contact so they can add another name to it.")
('Judith', 'Right. They would consider them a<br/>traitorous countryman.')
('Risette', "It's a sound plan.")
('Feri', "So who's going to be the third decoy?")
('Van', "I wanna bag this asshole myself, so I'm out. I think<br/>the best person for the job would be...")
('Van', "(The enemy's objective is to draw out<br/>pro-immigrant Calvardians.)")
('Van', "(Feri's from the Central East, so she doesn't fit the<br/>bill here. Which means the person who's best<br/>qualified for this is...)")
('Van', "(The enemy's objective is to draw out<br/>pro-immigrant Calvardians.)")
('Van', "(Aaron's of Eastern descent, so he doesn't fit the<br/>bill here. Which means the person who's best<br/>qualified for this is...)")
('Van', "(No, that's not right.)")
('Van', '(They actually do fit the bill, but that outfit draws a<br/>lot of attention.)')
('Van', "(The culprit probably doesn't want to stand out, so I<br/>don't think they'd target her. They're more likely to<br/>go after...)")
('Van', '(They actually do fit the bill, but their attire draws a<br/>fair bit of attention.)')
('Van', "(The culprit probably doesn't want to stand out, so I<br/>don't think they'd target him. They're more likely to<br/>go after...)")
('Van', '(...Nah. If her identity came to light, chaos would<br/>ensue, and our plan would be in shambles.<br/>Not happening.)')
('Van', "(There's someone else who's better suited for<br/>this role...)")
('Van', "(Master's an intimidating guy. No way our perp<br/>would approach him.)")
('Van', "(There's someone else who's better suited for<br/>this role...)")
('Van', 'Agnès, you up for this?')
('Agnès', 'M-Me?')
('Quatre', "Not that I'm opposed, but why her?")
('Van', "'Cause she fulfills all the requirements. Plus she seems<br/>timid at first glance, so they'd likely think she'd be<br/>easy to deal with.")
('Van', "She's the perfect decoy.")
('Agnès', "I'm not sure I love that assessment...but all right.<br/>I'll play the part.")
('Aaron', "Okay, so that takes care of that. Have you figured out<br/>how we're gonna catch this asshole?")
('Van', "Yeah. We're gonna need Agnès to...")
('Van', '...get a handwriting sample from him.')
('Bergard', 'Aha. Then we could compare that to the threat letter.<br/>Very clever.')
('Van', "Let's also record the conversation, just to be safe.")
('Van', "...record the conversation. That'll be our evidence.")
('Bergard', 'That may not be enough on its own. We may also<br/>need to get a handwriting sample from him.')
('Van', 'Ah, good point. That would definitely seal the deal.')
('Agnès', "Understood. I'll do my best.")
('Van', "Then it's settled. You okay with this plan?")
('Nelly', 'Absolutely!')
('Feri', "I'm just glad Amalie agreed so readily.")
('Quatre', 'She was rather indignant when we explained<br/>the situation.')
('Judith', 'She might come off as having a chip on her shoulder,<br/>but she has a strong sense of justice.')
('Aaron', 'I can respect that.')
('Van', 'People are starting to gather.')
('Bergard', 'The culprit may already be present. Keep your<br/>eyes peeled.')
(40301, "Isn't she an immigrant? She's got some nerve.")
(40301, 'Who cares about that? She has a lovely singing voice!')
(40301, "I can't believe I get to hear such beautiful music on<br/>the street. No wonder this place is called the city of<br/>art and tradition!")
('Jacobin', "So that damn immigrant didn't heed my warning.")
('Jacobin', "Well, at least I've been able to make good use of<br/>this opportunity.")
('Agnès', '(That guy has been approaching a lot of people.)')
('Agnès', '(And he has a survey in his hand! He must be<br/>the one.)')
('Agnès', '(I need to get close without raising his suspicion.)')
('Agnès', "That was incredible! You're both amazing singers!")
('Agnès', 'I wish I was half as talented as you!')
('Jacobin', 'Hello, young lady. Might I have a moment of<br/>your time?')
('Agnès', 'Umm... Sure. Is something the matter?')
('Jacobin', 'No, not at all. I was just curious about your thoughts<br/>on that performance.')
('Jacobin', 'Did you enjoy it?')
('Agnès', 'Oh, yes, very much so! I thought it was splendid!')
('Jacobin', 'Wonderful. I agree wholeheartedly.')
('Jacobin', 'Did you know that one of the performers is from the<br/>Central East?')
('Agnès', "Umm, yes, I noticed that. They were great,<br/>weren't they?")
('Jacobin', 'So I was right...')
('Agnès', "Huh? Sorry, I didn't catch that.")
('Jacobin', "Oh, think nothing of it. My name is Jacob, by<br/>the way. I'm currently running a survey.")
('Jacobin', "It's about racial harmony. Would you mind filling<br/>it out?")
('Jacobin', 'I might not have much power myself, but I want to<br/>do everything I can to achieve racial harmony here<br/>in Calvard.')
('Agnès', "That's an admirable goal.")
('Agnès', "Very well. I'd be more than happy to help.")
('Agnès', "(There's nothing particularly suspect about the<br/>questions themselves.)")
('Agnès', "(But they're asking for way too much<br/>personal information.)")
('Agnès', '(A legitimate survey would never ask for my full<br/>name, employer, and address—much less the names<br/>of my family members.)')
('Agnès', "(I'll just jot down what Van told me to write.)")
('Agnès', 'Okay. All done.')
('Jacobin', "Thank you for your time. I'll be taking my leave now.")
('Agnès', 'Oh, one more thing!')
('Jacobin', 'Hmm?')
('Agnès', 'I just wanted to say I very much enjoyed my<br/>conversation with you today!')
('Agnès', "If it's okay, would you mind writing down your<br/>number for me?")
('Jacobin', 'You...want my contact information? Whatever for?')
('Agnès', "Well, you see, I'm interested in the pro-immigration<br/>movement, so I'd like to stay in touch, if possible.")
('Jacobin', "A-Ah, of course. In that case, I'd be all too happy<br/>to oblige. One moment.")
('Jacobin', 'Here you are.')
('Van', "I'll take that.")
('Jacobin', 'Wh-Wha...? Who in the blazes are you?!')
('Van', "Just some guy who's on to your bullshit.")
('Van', 'You need permission from the city to run this<br/>kinda survey.')
('Van', 'Did you think you could skip that step?')
('Jacobin', '...')
('Van', "Your silence speaks volumes. Here, let's move this<br/>conversation somewhere else—and no, you don't have<br/>a choice.")
('Van', 'Nicely done, Agnès.')
('Agnès', "Thank you. I'm surprised I pulled it off, to be honest.")
('Jacobin', 'Wait, you two know each other?!')
('Jacobin', 'You were playing me from the start! How dare you lie<br/>to me, you damn brat!')
('Van', "If this ain't the pot callin' the kettle black, I don't<br/>know what is.")
('System', "Van ripped Jacob's glasses and beard off.")
('Van', "After all, you're not Jacob—you're Jacobin, the<br/>anti-immigration activist!")
('Jacobin', 'Wh-Wha...?')
('Van', "Don't play dumb with me.")
('Van', "We saw you givin' speeches earlier. Time to fess up.")
('Jacobin', '...')
('Jacobin', "I suppose there's no point in hiding it, then. Yes,<br/>I'm Jacobin.")
('Jacobin', 'But what of it?')
('Van', "Oh, so that's how you're gonna play this.")
('Jacobin', "I'll admit that I didn't get permission to hold this<br/>survey, but really, who cares about a trivial little rule<br/>like that?")
('Agnès', '...Jacobin.')
('Agnès', 'I apologize for deceiving you.')
('Agnès', "However, what you're doing is both wrong<br/>and criminal.")
('Jacobin', "That's quite the accusation—and I doubt you can<br/>back it up. After all, I did receive permission to give<br/>my speeches.")
('Agnès', "That isn't what I'm referring to—although I don't<br/>approve of those, either.")
('Agnès', "You've been harassing innocent immigrants, sent a<br/>threat letter to Nelly, and tried to pin it on Amalie.")
('Agnès', 'Those are all crimes.')
('Jacobin', "Hmph! I haven't the foggiest what you're referring to.")
('Van', "Back to playin' dumb, are we?")
('Van', "Well, let me enlighten you: here's the threat letter<br/>in question.")
('Jacobin', 'So? You have no proof that I wrote it.')
('Van', "You're about to eat your own words. We got this<br/>sheet of paper with all your contact info...")
('Van', '...which you penned yourself. Dumbass.')
('Van', "Oho! What a coinkydink! The handwriting's a<br/>perfect match.")
('Van', "The cops wouldn't even need to run this through<br/>the lab.")
('Van', 'The jig is up.')
('Jacobin', 'Ngh...!')
('Jacobin', "Unfortunately for you, it isn't. The cops can't touch<br/>me, even if they wanted to.")
('Jacobin', 'I have powerful friends in powerful places—including<br/>the very man who sits atop the orbal automobile<br/>industry itself!')
('Agnès', '(Wait. Does he mean...?)')
('Jacobin', 'The police are in his pocket. In fact, he can arrange<br/>for them to erase this event from the—')
('Van', "You're the idiot to end all idiots.")
('Van', 'Did you seriously think we were gonna turn you over<br/>to the cops? Hell no.')
('Van', "I'm sendin' you to meet my friends at the<br/>Bracer Guild.")
('Van', "They prioritize the safety of the citizens, so I'm sure<br/>they aren't gonna take kindly to you writing this<br/>threat letter.")
('Jacobin', 'Gah...!')
('Van', "If you somehow avoid punishment, the bracers'll still<br/>have you marked from here on out.")
('Jacobin', "This can't be happening...")
('Van', "I'm sendin' you into the loving arms of Heiyue.")
('Jacobin', 'What?!')
('Van', "They're the most powerful force of immigrants in all<br/>of the Republic. I'm sure they'll be all too happy to<br/>get their hands on you.")
('Van', "Nice knowin' you. May Aidios have mercy on your<br/>soul and all that.")
('Jacobin', 'Eeeeek!')
('Van', "All right, we're done here.")
('Van', "We'll just make a quick call, and then we'll send you<br/>on your way.")
('Jacobin', 'Gaaaaaah!')
('Jacobin', "You won't catch me alive!")
('Van', "You just don't know when to quit, do you?")
('Bergard', "And where do you think you're going, hmm?")
('Jacobin', 'Wha...?!')
('Judith', 'Give it up.')
('Aaron', "We've got the evidence, you moron. Running away<br/>isn't gonna save your ass.")
('Jacobin', 'Wh-Who in the hell are you?!')
('Van', "That's not really important.")
('Van', "All you need to know is we're Arkride Solutions.")
('Van', "We ain't on the side of justice, but for the right price,<br/>we're more than happy to bring down evildoing<br/>bastards like you.")
('Jacobin', "So you're fixers. Just my luck...")
('System', 'Jacobin was handed over to the guild.')
('System', 'Jacobin was handed over to Heiyue.')
('System', 'After that, Van relayed what happened to Nelly<br/>and Amalie.')
('Van', "You're Barton, right? We're here about your request.")
('Barton', 'Oh, are you the fixers? Thank goodness you came.')
('Agnès', 'You wanted us to look for someone, correct?')
('Barton', "Two people, actually. They're tourists.")
('Barton', "You see, I'm a tour guide, and I was guiding them<br/>around the city. I need you to find them.")
('Judith', 'Okay, but why call us? This sounds like a job the<br/>police or bracers could handle well enough.')
('Barton', "Well, I suppose you're not wrong...")
('Aaron', "Lemme guess: you're feeling guilty about something.")
('Aaron', "There's no way you'd call on a bunch of sketchy<br/>characters like us for help otherwise.")
('Van', "Don't call us sketchy in front of the damn client!")
('Barton', 'Umm... Part of why I came to you is because this is a<br/>matter that requires discretion.')
('Barton', 'I can get into why, but first, could you accept<br/>my request?')
('Van', 'Hmm...')
('Barton', "I'd like you to search for them if you're able.<br/>Could you please accept my request?")
('Van', 'Jobs like this can take a while.')
('Van', 'You mind if we come back later?')
('Barton', "Well, it's not like I can tell you no...")
('Barton', "Let me know when you finish your business. I'll be<br/>waiting here in the meantime.")
('Van', "Well, if you've got reason to be hush-hush about this,<br/>we'll hear you out.")
('Barton', 'Thank you so much!')
('Barton', 'So allow me to explain. You know about Vashtar<br/>Palace, right?')
('Barton', 'Well, the other day, it was made off limits<br/>to everyone.')
('Van', 'Yeah, we know about that already.')
('Quatre', '(And we know the reason why, too...)')
('Risette', '(I suspect the CID is the one who made that order—<br/>though I highly doubt they knew all the details when<br/>they did so.)')
('Barton', 'Vashtar Palace is one of the key destinations of the<br/>tour, so needless to say, people were bummed when<br/>they heard the news.')
('Barton', 'But I also let something else slip last night at dinner.')
('Barton', 'I mentioned there were rumors of a hidden tunnel<br/>that connected the underground ruins to the palace.')
('Barton', "But that's not all. One couple pressed me to tell them<br/>how to get into the underground ruins.")
('Barton', 'I know full well how dangerous that place can be, but<br/>they, umm...')
('Van', 'Lemme guess. They slid some mira your way, and you<br/>spilled the beans.')
('Barton', "Y-Yes. It's shameful, I know...")
('Aaron', "Shameful doesn't even begin to describe that,<br/>my dude.")
('Feri', 'You put their lives in danger.')
('Barton', 'I know...')
('Barton', "I may have been inebriated last night, but...<br/>No, there's no excuse for what I did.")
('Barton', 'Anyway, fast forward to this morning. After I woke<br/>up, I tried checking on that couple, but they were<br/>nowhere to be found.')
('Barton', "I'm almost certain they went to the<br/>underground ruins.")
('Agnès', "That's not good...")
('Barton', "I've been beating myself up over this...")
('Barton', "I know this won't make up for it, but I'm going to use<br/>my own money—including the amount I was given<br/>last night—to pay you for this request.")
('Barton', "Please bring them back safely! I'm begging you!")
('Van', "Don't worry. We've taken the job, so you've got our<br/>guarantee that we'll bring 'em back safe and sound.")
('Van', "Though you can bet your ass we'll be takin' the cash.")
('Barton', 'Of course! Thank you so much!')
('Bergard', "Now that that's settled, where is the entrance you told<br/>them about?")
('Bergard', "I assume you didn't inform them of every entrance<br/>point, yes?")
('Barton', "Of course not. Even I don't know where all of<br/>them are.")
('Barton', 'I told them about two of them.')
('Barton', 'The one near the market in the North District and<br/>the one next to the department store in the<br/>East District.')
('Feri', 'We can easily search both of them on our own.')
('Van', "Yeah. Though keep in mind, we're running up<br/>against the clock here.")
('Van', "If we don't think we can finish it in time, we'll pass<br/>this one over to the guild. That sound good?")
('Barton', "Yes, that's fine.")
('Barton', "I still have tours to conduct, so I'll leave the rest to<br/>you all.")
('Barton', 'If anything happens, please contact me.')
('Aaron', 'It just had to be the underground ruins.')
('Risette', 'We must do something about this.')
('Van', "I know. Thankfully, they don't have an access key, so<br/>there's no way they could've gotten far in.")
('Van', "But they ain't out of the woods. There are monsters<br/>roamin' near the entrances.")
('Bergard', 'True. We should make haste.')
('Agnès', "Should we search the one near the market? That one's<br/>closer to the palace.")
('Van', "Yeah, we'll hit that one first.")
('System', 'Quest Tourist Trouble started!')
(40301, 'Halt. This place is off limits.')
('Feri', "(It's a police officer.)")
('Aaron', '(Damn. What a pain in the ass.)')
('Van', "Actually, we've got business in there.")
('Van', "We're—")
(40301, 'Arkride Solutions, correct?')
('Agnès', 'You know about us?')
('Judith', "Ah! He's from Ikaruga?!")
('Bergard', 'He must be guarding this entrance.')
('Risette', 'So that was merely a disguise.')
(40401, 'Obviously.')
('Van', 'Damn. You could give a certain phantom thief lady I<br/>know a run for her money.')
('Judith', 'Shut up!')
('Judith', 'Uhh, I mean... Never mind.')
('Van', 'Well, you know who we are, so why not let<br/>us through?')
(40401, 'I suppose we do have a contract with one another, so<br/>that should be fine.')
(40401, "However, I'd still like you to state your business first.<br/>It's just a formality, you understand.")
(40401, 'This is Ikaruga territory. We cannot let you through<br/>without a valid reason.')
(40401, 'First, state your business.')
('Agnès', 'A pair of tourists may have wandered underground<br/>from this entrance.')
('Agnès', 'We received a request to search for them.')
(40401, 'Oh? Was this pair composed of a young man and<br/>woman, by any chance?')
('Feri', "You've seen them?!")
(40401, 'Yes. Not too long ago, I told them exactly what I told<br/>you—that this area was off limits.')
('Quatre', "I imagine they would've backed off if you were in<br/>your disguise.")
('Aaron', 'Yeah, no doubt.')
(40401, 'Soon after, I heard a bit of a ruckus coming from<br/>the marketplace.')
('Judith', 'What?')
(40401, 'Nevertheless, it turned out to be nothing. I doubt it<br/>has any bearing on your request.')
('Van', 'If you say so.')
(40401, "Well, then. I'd say your business here is concluded.")
(40401, 'If you will excuse me.')
('Feri', "He's gone...")
('Van', "If all of the Ikaruga jaegers are on his level, then it's<br/>no wonder they're known as the strongest corps in<br/>the East.")
('Bergard', "We should return to our search. If they were chased<br/>away, there's only one place they could have gone.")
('Risette', "And that is the underground ruins entrance next to<br/>the East District's department store.")
('Van', "Right. Let's get moving.")
('System', "The female tourist rode XEROS back to the surface,<br/>and Van's group joined her soon afterward.")
(40302, 'Thank you so much for saving us.')
('Van', "Well, we may not've been able to if those airsoft<br/>players didn't find you first.")
('Van', 'Though they did get an earful from the police after<br/>the fact.')
('Judith', 'Anyway, no more wandering into dangerous places<br/>like that. Got it?')
(40301, "You don't have to tell me twice. I'd rather not die if I<br/>can help it.")
('Barton', "Well, I'm glad these two came out unharmed. It's all<br/>thanks to you.")
(40302, "It's a good thing he contacted the bracers, huh?<br/>We can always count on them to keep us safe.")
('Aaron', "Sorry, but we aren't bracers.")
(40302, "You aren't?")
('Van', "Nope. We're Arkride Solutions.")
('Van', "We ain't allies of justice like the bracers, but if<br/>you're in a jam, we'll get you out of it—for the right<br/>price, of course.")
(40302, "Oh, you're fixers. I had no idea.")
(40301, "We'll make sure to remember that. I'm looking<br/>forward to the day I can send you all a request!")
('Agnès', "Umm... Respectfully, I don't think that's something<br/>you should be looking forward to.")
('System', 'Quest Tourist Trouble completed!')
('System', 'Received')
('Judith', "Okay, so we need to find the total number of films<br/>they're showing here.")
('Van', "Let's ask the receptionist. Ready to go in?")
('Judith', 'I...think it might be best for me to wait out here.')
('Agnès', 'Ah, right. You might be recognized in there.')
('Van', "Nah, I think she'd be fine. She ain't wearin' anything<br/>too sexy, so I doubt anyone would connect the dots.")
('Judith', 'Excuse me?! Do you seriously think sexy outfits are<br/>tied to my identity?!')
('Desiree', '*gasp* Zoe?!')
('Desiree', "Oh, I'm sorry. I mistook you for someone else.")
('Desiree', 'Zoe always dresses in much more revealing outfits.')
('Judith', "O-Oh, it's fine. Ahaha...")
('Feri', "Do you like movies, ma'am?")
('Desiree', "Yes, I do, young lady. I've seen every film that's in the<br/>theater right now.")
('Aaron', "Well, that's convenient.")
('Risette', 'Could you tell us how many films are presently being<br/>screened here?')
('Desiree', "Of course. They're showing eight films right now.")
('Desiree', "If you haven't seen it, I'd highly recommend<br/>Climber's Story, by the way.")
('Desiree', "It's a documentary about mountain climbing. It made<br/>me want to try my hand at it.")
('Agnès', "We'll consider watching it. Thank you very much.")
('Agnès', 'If you decide to try mountain climbing, please do<br/>be careful.')
('Desiree', 'Heehee. Thank you for your concern, dearie.')
('Desiree', 'Now, then. I hope you all enjoy the films here.')
('Bergard', "So there's eight in total. That's more than I<br/>had anticipated.")
('Van', 'I heard they screen them on rotation.')
('Van', "Anyway, we have our answer now. She saved us a trip<br/>to the receptionist's desk.")
('Quatre', 'Though she caused one of us a fair amount of<br/>distress, it seems.')
('Judith', "Urgh... I don't just take on sexy roles...")
('Van', "Let's, uh, leave her be for the time being.")
('Feri', "Aha! Here's the red tram.")
('Agnès', 'Just like Van said.')
('Aaron', 'The color really makes it stick out.')
('Van', "Let's get the number before it starts moving.")
('Feri', "Looks like it's 3451.")
('Quatre', 'That matches the number FIO recorded.')
('Judith', 'Phew. Just in the nick of time.')
('Judith', 'Finding that tram was a real hassle.')
('Van', "Surprised that it was, given that it's the only tram in<br/>Oración with a red top. Sticks out like a sore thumb.")
('Risette', "I wonder why it's the only one with that color.")
('Van', "There's a story behind that, actually. Decades ago, the<br/>painters who were workin' on that tram got mixed up<br/>about which color to use.")
('Van', "It was scheduled to get a repaint job a few days later,<br/>but while it was in operation, a string of miracles was<br/>bein' spun.")
('Van', "On that very tram, separated families reunited, and<br/>quarreling lovers kissed and made up. People were<br/>meetin' famous celebrities on it, too.")
('Van', "Soon enough, all the citizens were callin' it the Lucky<br/>Red Tram.")
('Feri', "That's a cute nickname.")
('Van', 'Yeah, and it really caught on. It was so popular, the<br/>tram company decided to leave the paint job as is.')
('Van', "Since then, they've always made sure to have one<br/>red-roofed tram in operation.")
('Agnès', 'What a lovely story.')
('Van', "It was marketing gold that fell right in the tram<br/>company's laps. Helped them get a shitton of butts<br/>in seats.")
('Judith', "Aaand it's ruined now.")
('Van', "You're Crema, right? Arkride Solutions, at<br/>your service.")
('Officer Katarina', "Actually, I'm her coworker, Katarina.")
('Officer Katarina', "Crema couldn't be here due to, umm,<br/>personal reasons. I'll be issuing the request in<br/>her stead.")
('Feri', 'Wait, is that allowed?')
('Aaron', "It shouldn't be. She could be acting without the<br/>original client's consent.")
('Judith', 'Always the skeptic.')
('Judith', "But I guess it's best to not be too trusting in this line<br/>of work.")
('Van', 'You got that right.')
('Van', "I'm willin' to hear you out, though. Why'd you take<br/>her place?")
('Officer Katarina', 'Allow me to get right to the point. I want to make a<br/>different request of you.')
('Officer Katarina', 'Please save her. Save Crema from herself.')
('Van', "Oh, boy. We haven't even started, and I'm already<br/>gettin' a migraine.")
('Van', 'All right. Gimme the deets.')
('Officer Katarina', 'It all started a few days ago.')
('Officer Katarina', "Crema's beloved—a bracer named Ewan—<br/>passed away.")
('Officer Katarina', 'He was brutally murdered by someone we suspect is<br/>connected to or a part of A.')
('Quatre', 'Right. We heard about that from the guild.')
('Quatre', "That's...awful.")
('Judith', 'I feel so sorry for her.')
('Van', "A bracer and cop couple? Well, there's something I<br/>don't hear every day.")
('Van', "Those two organizations aren't exactly on the best of<br/>terms in most places.")
('Officer Katarina', "And that's very much the case here. It's why Crema<br/>kept her relationship under wraps—at least for those<br/>of us at the station.")
('Officer Katarina', 'I hear things were getting serious between the two.<br/>They were considering tying the knot, in fact.')
('Agnès', "No wonder she's so determined to gather information<br/>on Almata.")
('Officer Katarina', 'Yes... Since then, revenge has been the only thing on<br/>her mind.')
('Officer Katarina', "I've been trying to be there for her. I wanted to help<br/>her get through this.")
('Officer Katarina', 'But I found out she put up a request on the<br/>bulletin board.')
('Van', "Yeah, but she ain't here for some reason.")
('Officer Katarina', 'Right. And I know what that reason is: she started<br/>tailing someone on her own.')
('Risette', 'Oh, dear.')
('Officer Katarina', 'I saw her doing that a few minutes ago.')
('Officer Katarina', "Earlier, I had gone by the station to check on her.<br/>She was supposed to be on duty, but I didn't see<br/>her there.")
('Officer Katarina', 'I asked another officer if they knew where she was,<br/>and they told me she suddenly took time off.')
('Officer Katarina', 'After that, I started frantically looking for her around<br/>the city.')
('Officer Katarina', 'I finally found her in a back alley. She was staring at<br/>the entrance of an exchange shop.')
('Officer Katarina', 'Just as I was thinking about calling out to her, she left<br/>her hiding spot and began following someone from<br/>a distance.')
('Bergard', "I'm surprised to hear she didn't call it in.")
('Officer Katarina', "You and me both. That's what we're supposed to do<br/>when we spot someone acting suspicious.")
('Officer Katarina', "I just don't understand why she'd go off on her own...")
('Van', 'There has to be a reason behind her behavior.')
('Agnès', "I'm guessing she's seeking revenge against Almata.")
('Agnès', 'And she must want to settle the matter personally.')
('Officer Katarina', "That's probably it. The person she's pursuing may be<br/>connected to A.")
('Aaron', "(That doesn't really narrow things down. There's a<br/>lotta guys in the underworld with ties to them.)")
('Feri', "(I'm worried about that officer. She's in a lot<br/>of danger...)")
('Judith', 'So, back to your request. You said you want us to<br/>save her?')
('Officer Katarina', "Yes, that's right.")
('Officer Katarina', "I don't know what her plan is, but knowing her, it'll<br/>be a reckless one.")
('Officer Katarina', 'I doubt I can stop her—but I trust that you can.')
('Agnès', 'Well? What do you think, Van?')
('Officer Katarina', "I'd like you all to stop Crema before she ends up<br/>getting hurt.")
('Officer Katarina', 'I doubt I can stop her—but I trust that you can.')
('Agnès', 'Well? What do you think, Van?')
('Van', "Sorry, but there's some business we gotta wrap<br/>up first.")
('Van', 'Can you give me a little more time?')
('Officer Katarina', 'Okay.')
('Officer Katarina', "I'll be here if you decide to accept it.")
('Van', "All right. We'll take the job.")
('Van', "Truthfully, I only came here to warn her about<br/>stickin' her nose where it doesn't belong.")
('Van', "We'll find her and bring her here—even if we gotta<br/>drag her back by the ears to do it.")
('Officer Katarina', 'Of course! Thank you so much!')
('Van', "Let's go to the exchange shop and do some<br/>snoopin' around.")
('Van', "Doubt she's there now, but if we're lucky, we might<br/>pick up a trail.")
('Risette', 'Understood.')
('Officer Katarina', 'Good luck, you all!')
('System', 'Quest Revenge Against A started!')
('Van', "Hey. We're Arkride Solutions.")
('Van', 'We wanted to ask you something.')
('Pershing', 'All right. Shoot.')
('Agnès', 'Did you happen to see a female officer here a little<br/>while ago?')
('Agnès', 'Someone asked us to find her.')
('Pershing', 'Yeah, I did. About thirty minutes ago, in fact.')
('Feri', 'Sounds like we hit the jackpot!')
('Van', 'Did anyone stop by just before her?')
('Pershing', 'Hmm... Yes, actually. There was a man wearing<br/>a suit.')
('Pershing', 'He picked up a full set of quartz.')
('Judith', "Well, that's not too out of the ordinary.")
('Judith', 'Was he, like, a businessman or something?')
('Pershing', "I'm not really sure. If I'm being honest, he struck me<br/>as one of those shady types.")
('Pershing', "Now that I think about it, I've been getting all kinds<br/>of suspicious-looking customers lately.")
('Quatre', '(I wonder if he would put us in that category...)')
('Risette', '(Based on his description, I think we can discount the<br/>possibility of an Almata leader being the perpetrator.)')
('Van', 'Okay, so we know for sure the officer has been<br/>following a man in a suit.')
('Van', 'Now we need to figure out where they went.')
('Pershing', 'I think I can help you there as well.')
('Pershing', 'The man said he was gonna hit up the weapons shop<br/>in the Quincy Department Store.')
('Pershing', 'That officer was pursuing him just like you guys.')
('Pershing', 'So I told her where he was headed.')
('Bergard', 'Hmm...')
('Feri', "Great! Now that we know where they're headed, we<br/>can find her in a jiff!")
('Van', "Yeah. Let's move, you guys. We've got no time<br/>to waste.")
('Officer Katarina', "I can't believe she was in that much danger.")
('Officer Katarina', 'Guess reaching out to you guys was the right call.')
('Officer Crema', 'Yeah. I was way in over my head. Sorry for<br/>worrying you.')
('Officer Crema', "And I'm sorry I caused you all so much trouble.")
('Officer Crema', "The request ended up being different from what I<br/>originally intended, but I'll gladly pay up.")
('Van', "Cool. We'll take it.")
('Judith', 'So what are you planning to do about the<br/>original request?')
('Judith', "Unfortunately, we can't really help you with it.")
('Judith', 'Will you give it up?')
('Officer Crema', "I really, REALLY don't want to.")
('Officer Crema', 'But I understand now that I have to let this go.')
('Officer Katarina', 'Crema...')
('Officer Crema', 'Ewan played the part of the cool, calm, and collected<br/>bracer until the very end. I want to take after him.')
('Officer Crema', "Also, I don't want him to worry about me while he's<br/>up there with the Goddess.")
('Judith', "That's good to hear.")
('Quatre', 'What a relief.')
('Bergard', 'The discord in your heart may never truly fade—and<br/>it may flicker as it did tonight—but I believe you will<br/>learn to achieve harmony with yourself.')
('Officer Crema', "By the way, I know I shouldn't pry...")
('Officer Crema', "...but I know you're doing something in the<br/>underground—just like the Dolor Family was.")
('Officer Crema', "If there's something I can do—anything at all—let<br/>me know. I'll help however I can.")
('Van', "Got'cha. We'll consider taking you up on your<br/>offer, then.")
('Aaron', "Just know you aren't the only one who has beef<br/>with A.")
('Aaron', "If we butt heads with them, I'll make sure to punch<br/>their lights out for you.")
('Officer Crema', 'Heehee. It means a lot to hear you say that.')
('Officer Katarina', 'Again, thank you so much for saving Crema.')
('Officer Katarina', "If you're ever in trouble, just give us a call, and we'll<br/>rush on over.")
('Van', 'Cool. Thanks for offering.')
('System', 'Quest Revenge Against A completed!')
('System', 'Earned')
('System', 'Received')
('Van', "We don't got time to hang around.")
('Van', "We'll head back once we've got some answers.")
('System', 'Go to the labyrinth?')
