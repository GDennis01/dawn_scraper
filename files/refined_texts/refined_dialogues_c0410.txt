('Agnès', "That's right. According to the travel guide, it even has<br/>something called an aerotram.")
('Albert', 'So, uh...if I may ask, Agnès. What exactly were you<br/>and that man talking abou—')
('Renne', "Come on. The train is departing, so let's get a<br/>move on.")

('Fie', 'Risette! And demon spheres, too! But why so many<br/>of them?')
('Kincaid', 'The White Orchid Dragon and demon spheres!<br/>But look at how many there are!')
('Risette', 'We...appear to be rather outnumbered.')
('Cao', 'Oh, but their numbers are meaningless against our<br/>combined might.')
('Cao', 'Yuemen Dunjia!')
('Van', 'Great timing...')
('Feri', 'Holy moly...')
('Aaron', 'Talk about a one-two punch...')
('Shizuna', "Let's not get careless!")
('Fie', "It's not over yet!")
('Kincaid', 'Things are not settled yet!')
('Risette', "Ngh... It's just as I feared. We must take down the<br/>main body!")
('Cao', 'Hmm... A more even playing field would be<br/>preferable, of course, but as things are now—oh?')
('Cao', 'Heh. It appears the pieces are now in place.')

('Aaron', "Looks like someone's enjoying himself.")
('Feri', 'Lending my assistance, Risette!')
('Shizuna', 'Less talk—more annihilation!')
('Fie', "We can chat later. Let's take them out!")
('Kincaid', 'Cut the chitchat. Wipe them out!')
('Risette', 'Understood!')
('Cao', 'We shall crush them in one fell swoop!')
('Van', 'So you completely ignored your boss and went off on<br/>your own, huh?')
('Risette', 'Heehee. Call it a hunch, but I suspected you would<br/>take action immediately.')
('Risette', 'Pardon my presumption, but I had hoped to gather as<br/>much information as possible.')
('Van', "Hey, I'm grateful for it.")
('Feri', 'Risette!')
('Risette', "I'm glad you are all right, Ms. Al-Fayed.")
('Risette', 'You as well, Mr. Wei.')
('Risette', "And I'm glad you are well, Mr. Wei.")
('Aaron', "Psh. I knew you'd be fine from the get-go.")
('Van', "So...what's your angle here? I'm gonna go out on a<br/>limb and assume this ain't volunteer work.")
('Cao', 'I simply hoped to get a handle on the situation on<br/>behalf of Heiyue.')
('Cao', "That, and Ms. Twinings' superior skills have been the<br/>subject of my attention for quite some time.")
('Risette', 'Oh...?')
('Cao', 'What say you? We would happily welcome you upon<br/>you leaving his office.')

('Fie', "You're as unpredictable as ever...")

('Feri', 'Ahaha...')

('Agnès', 'Track one would beee...on the left side of the station.<br/>Shall we get moving?')
('Van', 'You the guy in the request?')
('Van', "We're Arkride Solutions. We'll take the goods<br/>from here.")
('Man', '...Who might the young lady be?')
('Van', "My new assistant. She's still in training, but you can<br/>trust her.")
('Agnès', 'Pleased to meet you.')
('Man', "...Very well. It's in the case.")
('Agnès', "And just like that, he's gone...")
('Agnès', "Oh! There's something under the bench.")
('Van', 'Huh. So I take it this was meant for us?')
('System', 'Van and Agnès grabbed the attaché case and the<br/>accompanying note.')
('Agnès', "An attaché case and a note...<br/>(This definitely doesn't reek of a shady deal.)")
('Van', 'Cool. We got what we came for. Time to get<br/>outta here.')
('Van', "It'd be a serious pain in the ass if our 'buddies'<br/>decided to drop by.")
('Agnès', "Good point. Let's be on our way.")
