('Agnès', 'Nmm...')
('Van', 'Hey. Finally awake, huh?')
('Agnès', 'Mmm... Morning, Van...')
('Agnès', 'Last night, did you...uh...')
('Agnès', "Oh, we're in...the Shirin Desert? I read about it in<br/>one of my textbooks.")
('Feri', 'Mugh...')
('Aaron', 'You know, I kind of dig it.')
('Van', "We just entered the desert proper. We'll get to<br/>Tharbad in about an hour.")
('Van', "In the meantime, I'm bushed. You take over,<br/>number three.")
('Aaron', "Sweet Aidios, how the hell can he just pass out right<br/>there like it's nothing? It's like he's still in puberty<br/>or something.")
('Feri', 'Haha! Hey, rest is important. Conking out on<br/>demand is, uh, a good skill to have!')
('Agnès', "He really did drive a lot. No wonder he's so tired.")
('Feri', 'There sure are a lot of cars on the road.')
('Agnès', 'They must be traveling to the film festival.')
('Aaron', "Now that the old man's sawing logs, nothing's<br/>stopping me from putting the pedal to the metal and<br/>seeing how fast this sucker can go.")
('Agnès', "How about no. Let's just get to Tharbad in one<br/>piece, please.")
('Feri', "Let's see, according to this map... Yep, like Van said,<br/>we're about an hour away.")
('Feri', 'Hey, there it is!')
('Aaron', "That's the city, huh? Bigger than I imagined.")
('Agnès', 'A city overlooking an oasis, perched right between<br/>tradition and modernity...')
('Agnès', 'That must be Tharbad, all right.')
(40301, 'Wahoo!')
(40302, "Hell yeah! Let's kick this baby into overdrive! Give it<br/>all she's got!")
('Shaheena', 'Hey, let us go!')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "If... If you don't take us back right now, I'm gonna<br/>sue you thugs when this is over!")
(40301, "Ha! Relax. Nothing's gonna happen to you two.<br/>Nobody wants a couple of washboard little girls!")
('Shaheena', 'Hey! Who are you calling a little girl, huh?!')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Oh, THAT does it! I'm suing you for sexual<br/>harassment while I'm at it!")
(40302, 'Shut the hell up back there!')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', '...! / Eek!')
(40302, "Seriously, you're gonna be fine. You two are simply<br/>bait for who we're really after.")
(40302, "We've got our eyes on that actress and that<br/>fine-looking sister of yours. They won't be able to<br/>stop themselves from coming.")
(40301, "But hey, who's to say we won't put you girls through<br/>the wringer for the hell of it, anyway? Haha.")
('Shaheena', 'Mmgh...')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'You people are despicable.')
(40302, "Man, screw it, I can't stop thinking about it! I say we<br/>go hog wild! No holding back!")
(40301, "Exactly! The film festival's almost here. Gotta hype<br/>ourselves up somehow! Might as well have some fun!")
('Shaheena', '...!')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Wh-Where are you goons taking us anyway, huh?')
(40302, "Huh? What do you mean where're we taking you?<br/>We're...")
(40301, 'Hold on... Where ARE we supposed to be heading?')
('Feri', 'No! Shaheena! And Marielle, too!')
('Dingo', "What you're looking at are security camera stills.")
('Dingo', 'From the looks of it, they nabbed the sister on her<br/>way home after she got tossed out of Vegas Films.')
('Agnès', 'And then Marielle was taken with her when she tried<br/>to intervene...')
('Aaron', "Damn. These guys aren't screwing around.")
('Risette', "It's a very unusual situation.")
('Risette', 'It resembles the incident in Messeldam that the<br/>Marduk Company uncovered, during its<br/>follow-up investigation.')
('Feri', 'Say what?')
('Van', '...No kidding?')
('Dingo', 'Yep. As it just so happens, folks there saw a lot of<br/>strange fighting crop up out of nowhere, too.')
('Dingo', 'While their hands were full trying to put it to rights, a<br/>series of mysterious fires broke out. After all that,<br/>they canceled the film festival.')
('Aaron', 'That definitely sounds too similar to be a coincidence<br/>to me.')
('Agnès', "Don't forget, Messeldam used to be where A's<br/>headquarters were located, too.")
('Agnès', 'And remember the shell company they used to rent<br/>out the warehouse in Langport? That was the<br/>Tharbad Transportation Company.')
('Aaron', "Shit. I didn't put that together!")
('Feri', "That must mean it's all connected!")
('Van', "...We still haven't seen any signs of organized crime<br/>in Tharbad. Or any other gang activity for<br/>that matter.")
('Van', "But let's assume for a minute these guys have a hand<br/>in all these incidents of people coming unglued.")
('Van', "It's possible that stuff their members like to use could<br/>also be involved.")
('Agnès', "You don't mean...!")
('Feri', 'Wait, like—')
('Aaron', "You mean what Heiyue's got a hard ban on? Yeah, I<br/>could definitely see it.")
('Dingo', "Even if that's true, how they're getting it to people<br/>out here is the big question.")
('Risette', 'Indeed. From what I have heard, that is exactly what<br/>the police and guild are both attempting to hone<br/>in on.')
('Van', "...Feels like the pieces for this mystery are startin' to<br/>come together.")
('Van', "If A's actually involved in all of this, they definitely<br/>seem to be keeping a low profile, at least for now.")
('Van', "Hopefully, once we get a hold of these dumbasses and<br/>get 'em to talk, things'll start to look a bit clearer.")
