('Agnès', "It's a three-day weekend, so as long as we're only<br/>staying the one night, I can join you.")
('Feri', "You mean it? I'm so happy you get to come!")
('Agnès', "I'm happy you get to come, too, Feri.")
('Van', 'HELLO? Are you two even listening to me?')
('Van', "We know from the get-go that Almata's involved<br/>this time.")
('Van', "And my gut's tellin' me this is gonna be real trouble,<br/>so I want you two to stay parked right he—")
('Feri', "That's exactly why I want to come and protect you!")
('Feri', 'I want to know what the people who did that to Aida<br/>are after, too.')
('Agnès', "And with all I know about what's going on, I don't<br/>want to be the only one sitting around in the capital.")
('Agnès', 'Besides...')
('Agnès', '...as long as the Geneses might be involved, this is<br/>my problem as much as it is yours.')
('Agnès', "I'll start packing my things as soon as I get back to my<br/>dorm—so please, take me with you!")
('Van', "Man, a big-ass bracer like you can't just stand around<br/>here and not expect to get stares...")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Hey there. Sorry for calling you on such short notice.')
('Zin the Immovable', "How'd you manage to convince the others to let<br/>you go?")
('Van', "Don't worry about it. I lost 'em anyways.")
('Van', "But think you could give me more of a heads up<br/>next time? Those kids'll poke their nose into anything<br/>once they catch a whiff.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Hahaha! Sure thing. Next time.')
('Van', '*sigh*')
('Van', 'So, what do you even want from me?')
('Van', "If you just wanted someone to help you blend in,<br/>wouldn't Elaine or Claussell've done the job just fine?")
('Zin the Immovable', "They're tough enough to serve as backup, but they'd<br/>probably make me stand out more than you think.")
('Zin the Immovable', "'Sides, I think you're a better fit with who we're about<br/>to meet.")
('Van', 'Oh, come ON...')
('Zin the Immovable', "Hey, I'll buy you a drink for the trouble. Anyway, let's<br/>get going.")
('Judith', 'Oh...')
('Nina', "Huh? That is...you, isn't it, Judith? Did you dye<br/>your hair?")
('Agnès', "(Judith! You're still in disguise!)")
('Judith', "N-Nope, nothing like that! See? I was just trying out<br/>a new wig, that's all.")
('Judith', "What's up, Nina? I did tell you I won't be back for a<br/>while, didn't I?")
('Nina', 'You did, but Mr. Gotti insisted that I get in touch<br/>with you right away.')
('Nina', "He's pushing the whole film industry to release a<br/>statement and make a donation in response to Creil.")
('Judith', '...I see.')
('Judith', "I'm a little tied up, so I can't do anything right this<br/>second, I'm afraid... Can I call you back tonight?")
('Nina', 'Of course. Take care and talk to you later, then.')
('Judith', 'You, too. Thanks.')
('Feri', "That's a big surprise coming from the director...")
('Aaron', "Doesn't feel like him, but maybe he's the type to take<br/>action when shit hits the fan.")
('Risette', 'Indeed. He strikes me as not only a passionate man,<br/>but a compassionate one as well.')
('Van', 'Haha. For sure.')
('Judith', "Well, I'm with him. I'm not going to let this tragedy<br/>stand—not as someone in the film industry or as<br/>a thief.")
('Judith', "We're absolutely going to take Almata down for this,<br/>but we have to know what we're up against if we're<br/>going to protect all we can!")
('Agnès', 'Exactly!')
('Quatre', "I couldn't agree more.")
('Van', 'There they are!')
('Shizuna', "And there's our demon sphere.")
('Kincaid', "And as we suspected, there's the demon sphere.")
('Cao', 'And right there is our demon sphere!')
('Feri', "I'll keep them at bay, Fie!")
('Feri', "While I'm doing that—")
('Fie', "Back up a bit. You're better when it comes to forcing<br/>your way through enemies. Leave disrupting them<br/>to me.")
('Fie', 'If we can keep that sphere in check, that should make<br/>life easier for everyone!')
('Feri', '...!')
('Fie', "This might've been a mistake. If only we had three—<br/>even two more people...")
('Van', 'Ferida! Claussell!')
('Feri', 'Van!')
('Feri', 'Van! Aaron! Risette!')
('Feri', 'Van! Aaron!')
('Feri', 'Van! Risette!')
('Aaron', "Don't get cocky and start running on ahead, kiddos.")
('Risette', "We are so glad that you're both all right.")
('Fie', "Didn't expect Ikaruga's second-in-command to be<br/>with you.")
('Shizuna', 'Heya, Sylphid. Good to see you again.')
('Fie', "Sure didn't expect the CID's aide to be with you.")
('Kincaid', "We do run into one another in the strangest of places,<br/>now, don't we?")
('Fie', "Didn't expect Heiyue's White Orchid Dragon to be<br/>with you.")
('Cao', 'Heh. How lovely it is see you again, Fie.')
('Van', 'The talking can wait. We gotta take these down first!')
('Van', "We're countin' on you for backup, Claussell.")
('Feri', "I'm ready!")
('Fie', "The same to you. Let's kick some butt!")
('Van', "Whew... Glad that's over.")
('Shizuna', 'Looks like we severed the connection between the<br/>sphere and the devils.')
('Kincaid', 'Indeed. That sphere will no longer supply power.')
('Cao', 'I believe that sphere will supply power no longer.')
('Fie', 'So our theory was right on the money, then.')
('Feri', 'Van!')
('Van', 'E-Easy, now...')
('Feri', "*sniffle* I'm so happy to see you again...")
('Feri', 'Everything just happened so suddenly that I...I...')
('Van', 'Man...')
('Aaron', 'About time you showed your kid side.')
('Risette', "I'm so glad that you're unharmed.")
('Feri', "Don't think you're both escaping without one, either!")
('Feri', "Don't think you're escaping without one, either!")
('Feri', "You're getting one, too, Risette!")
('Aaron', 'Argh! Knocked the wind right outta me...')
('Risette', "Heehee. It's good to see you again.")
('Fie', 'Good grief...')
('Shizuna', "Well, I'd say we're done here. Let's get back to<br/>the bistro.")
('Kincaid', "I'd say our work here is done. We should return to<br/>the bistro.")
('Cao', "I think our work here is done. Why don't we return to<br/>the bistro?")
(40301, 'The next train should be here any minute...')
(40301, '...')
('Van', "Somethin' up, buddy? That sure was a heavy sigh.")
('Van', "Might be a bit if you're waitin' for the train. Sure you<br/>wanna stand that long?")
(40301, '...')
('Van', 'Hey, you can talk to me. I already know your<br/>plan, anyways.')
('Van', "You're gonna jump in front of the train and put<br/>yourself out of your misery, right?")
(40301, '...!')
(40301, '...Who are you?')
('Van', "Just some guy who was asked by a stall owner in<br/>Riverside to deliver somethin'.")
('Van', 'You forgot your cake bag there.')
(40301, "...Oh. So that's where I left it.")
(40301, "I'd planned to use that to end it all after enjoying a<br/>few drinks and some music...")
(40301, '...but by the end, I got so drunk I forgot all about it.')
('Van', "Lucky for you, I'm here to give it back.")
('Van', "Before I do, though, I'm curious—what made you<br/>wanna resort to that to begin with?")
(40301, "I suppose you're gonna try to change my mind, huh?")
('Van', "Nah. Not plannin' to butt into your business.<br/>Just wanna know, is all.")
(40301, "Almost feels like you're treating this like some<br/>kinda entertainment.")
('Van', "Sorry, don't take it the wrong way. You've got a lot<br/>more life experience than me, so I was thinkin'<br/>something like this'd be useful to know.")
(40301, 'Pfft. Yeah, sure.')
(40301, "Sorry, but I can't imagine anything I can say will be of<br/>any use to you.")
(40301, 'You can find stories like mine around every corner.')
(40301, 'I lost my job—all because my new superior at work<br/>really had it in for me.')
('Van', 'Any idea why?')
(40301, "I couldn't tell you why he hated me so much—just<br/>that he did.")
(40301, "I started getting blamed for anything and everything.<br/>Didn't matter whether it was my fault or not. In the<br/>end, even my own workers lost faith in me.")
(40301, "I worked so hard to build up my place in the<br/>company—to get my coworkers' trust. I had<br/>everything up through my retirement worked out.")
(40301, 'Decades of hard work and planning, all gone in<br/>a flash. Life lost all meaning afterwards.')
('Van', 'I guess that had to have hit pretty hard.')
(40301, "That's putting it lightly. My job was basically all<br/>I had. I'm still single, and I don't have any hobbies<br/>or skills.")
(40301, "I can't help but wonder where I went wrong. Did I do<br/>something to piss off Aidios...?")
('Van', "(Hmm... I know I told him I wouldn't butt in...)")
('Van', '(...but the client trusted me with him.)')
('Van', "(That means I've gotta at least try to change<br/>his mind.)")
('Van', '(Looks like I might have a bit of room to do<br/>that, luckily.)')
('Van', '(So the question is: should I try to convince him the<br/>old-fashioned way? Or give him the cold shoulder<br/>and see how he reacts to that?)')
('Van', "(One of those'll hopefully work.)")
('Van', "(Let's try the old-fashioned approach.)")
('Van', 'Let me get this straight...')
('Van', "You got fired because this superior of yours blamed<br/>you for stuff you didn't do, right?")
(40301, "That's right. What of it?")
('Van', "There's your way out of this, then. Sue his ass.")
(40301, "Hah. Don't make me laugh.")
(40301, "You really think he'd leave evidence lying around<br/>that'd incriminate him? No way the company<br/>wouldn't cover it all up.")
(40301, "It'd be next to impossible to beat them in court.")
('Van', 'Without me, you mean.')
('System', 'Van handed the man his business card.')
('Van', "I'm a spriggan from Arkride Solutions. I take on jobs<br/>you can't bring to the police or the guild.")
('Van', "This is a bit outside my usual scope, but I'm feelin'<br/>generous, so I'll make an exception.")
('Van', "I'll get you whatever evidence you need to win in<br/>trial—guaranteed.")
(40301, "Oh, I get it. So you're the spriggan I've heard so<br/>much about.")
(40301, "It's hard to believe you can pull off the miracle I'd<br/>need for this, but...")
(40301, "...Never mind. I'd rather not try my luck.")
('Van', "How come? This is my job, so as long as you pay, I'll<br/>make sure it's done right.")
(40301, "Haha. Nah, that's not it. I just remembered how<br/>exhausting it was to work there. It was like I had to<br/>stress about every little detail.")
(40301, "You say you can get my job back, but honestly, I'm<br/>not sure if I even want it that badly.")
(40301, 'What was I even thinking? I should be happy to be<br/>out, but here I was about to kill myself after losing it.')
(40301, 'I have no idea what came over me.')
('Van', "Hey, things happen. So, what's the plan, then?<br/>If you're not gonna try to get your old job back,<br/>you've gotta find somethin' else to live for.")
(40301, "I don't know yet, but I don't think I should rush into<br/>a new job immediately.")
(40301, "I think I need to take a little time for myself first.<br/>I'll find a hobby, think about what I really want in<br/>life, and THEN I can start searching.")
('Van', 'Yeah, that sounds like a mighty fine idea to me.<br/>Good on ya.')
('Van', "(Let's try givin' him the cold shoulder.)")
('Van', "You got any idea how much mira it'll cost if<br/>you jump? It ain't cheap—I can tell ya that much.")
('Van', "Succeed or fail, the train company's not gonna be<br/>happy about it.")
(40301, "...So? I'll be dead, so it won't affect me.")
('Van', "Maybe. Or maybe you'll live, and you'll just get a life<br/>stay in a hospital bed instead. Wouldn't be the first.")
('Van', "In that case, you'd get the one-two combo of medical<br/>bills and damages owed. Sounds like a living hell<br/>to me.")
(40301, 'Oh, okay. So I should find some way to kill myself<br/>besides jumping in front of a train.')
(40301, 'In that case, just hurry and give me back my gun!<br/>Nobody will care if I kill myself with that, right?!')
('Van', "Sure, that's fine—just be aware that you can still<br/>screw up and miss that way. Hurts like a bitch, or so<br/>I've heard.")
(40301, 'I did NOT need to know that. I figured you were<br/>trying to stop me, not give me useless trivia.')
(40301, 'If not, do you mind handing over my gun instead and<br/>letting me take the easy way out?')
('Van', "And that's what I'm tryin' to tell you—suicide ain't<br/>the easy way out you thought it was.")
('Van', "You're startin' to realize that, too. I can tell everything<br/>I've been saying's got you scared shitless.")
(40301, '...!')
(40301, "Keep talking—it won't change the fact that I don't<br/>have any other options left.")
('Van', 'Sure you do. Just go right on back to the stall you<br/>were at for another drink or fifty.')
('Van', "That sounds a hell of a lot easier than what you're<br/>tryin' to do here.")
(40301, '...')
('Van', "Anyway, I suppose I'll get out of your hair.<br/>Whatever you decide to do ain't any of my business.")
(40301, '...')
(40301, "Goddess above. I don't even know why I took losing<br/>my job this badly to begin with.")
(40301, "When it happened, I just randomly decided it'd be<br/>easier to die than to go through it all.")
(40301, 'All I wanted was to run away from a terrible<br/>situation—not to actually die.')
(40301, "*sigh* Yeah, no way am I doing it now. Maybe you're<br/>right about there being an easier way out of this.")
('Van', "Heh. That's the spirit.")
(40301, "I never would've guessed leaving that bag behind<br/>would save my life.")
('Van', "I guess it did. While I'm still thinking about it, here<br/>you go.")
('System', 'Van handed the man his bag.')
(40301, "Haha... I went through so much trouble to get this<br/>thing, but I can't even imagine using it now.")
(40301, 'I think you said that stall owner was the one who<br/>asked you to find me?')
(40301, 'The least I can do is pay you on her behalf.')
(40301, 'It was more than worth it getting the chance to talk<br/>to you.')
('Van', "Works for me. I don't care who does it as long as I<br/>get paid. I'll let her know you settled the bill.")
(40301, "I'd appreciate it, thanks.")
(40301, "Well, I'd best head on home for today.")
(40301, "I've done enough drinking for one night, and it'd be<br/>better to cool my head and do some thinking.")
(40301, "You're a lifesaver, young man—literally. I'll never<br/>forget the debt I owe you.")
('System', 'The next train arrived soon after, and Van made sure<br/>the man safely boarded it.')
('System', 'Afterward, he finished up the job by calling Shino<br/>with the details of what had happened.')
('System', 'Quest What Once Was Lost completed!')
('System', 'Received')
('Van', "Yo. We're playin' a puzzle game right now.")
('Van', "I take it you're the one watchin' over the second key?")
('Station Worker', 'Heh. Very astute.')
('Station Worker', "You'd be correct! Before you stands the supervisor of<br/>the Kingdom of Edith's underground mine!")
('Station Worker', "With the subterranean tunnels known only to me,<br/>whisking away the princess was child's play.")
('Van', "(Looks like he's really gotten into this...)")
('Agnès', 'So you were the one who kidnapped her, then?')
('Feri', "So you're the one who kidnapped her, then?")
('Aaron', "So you're the one who actually nabbed her.")
('Station Worker', 'In one sense, yes. I did little more than carry her off<br/>to her prison, however.')
('Station Worker', 'It was someone else who hatched the plot to take<br/>her there.')
('Station Worker', "I assume you want to know who, but you'll get<br/>nothing more from me. If you desire the truth, it lies<br/>beyond the next mystery.")
('Station Worker', "Here's the second key, as a reward for your cunning.")
('System', 'Van received the second key!')
('Van', "Jumpin' straight to the next one, huh? Let's see...")
('System', 'The final key is in the Tyrell District.<br/>The ever-resourceful guide of the theater has it on<br/>their person.')
('Van', "So this one's in Tyrell.")
('Agnès', "'The ever-resourceful guide of the theater'? Maybe it's<br/>some kind of code.")
('Feri', "'The ever-resourceful guide of the theater'? I...think I<br/>kind of get it. Maybe?")
('Aaron', "'The ever-resourceful guide of the theater'?<br/>Another dumb riddle, I'm guessing.")
('Van', "At this point, I'm kinda curious about the<br/>ending, honestly.")
('Van', "Let's get a move on.")
(40302, "So next up is...Old Town, right? What'll we<br/>find there?")
('Van', "Oh, just the perfect place to end our tour. That's all.")
('Van', "Long as you don't let the chef's face spook ya, at least.")
('Elaine', "I assume you mean Montmart? I'll look forward to<br/>that—")
(40302, '...Huh?!')
('Van', 'Ah, crap.')
(40301, '...!')
('Van', "This happens from time to time. The lights down<br/>here haven't been replaced in a while.")
('Elaine', 'The both of you are unharmed, ri—')
(40302, "Don't worry, it's okay! No one's here to hurt you!")
('Elaine', 'Is this...what I think it is?')
(40302, "Sh-She still gets like this whenever she's in dark,<br/>cramped places.")
(40302, 'It must remind her of where we were trapped.')
(40302, "Sorry. I don't think she's gonna be able to move<br/>anytime soon.")
('Elaine', "(I shouldn't be surprised her emotional scars run<br/>so deep...)")
('Elaine', "(Can't I do anything to help her? Anything at all?!)")
('Van', 'Upsy-daisy.')
('System', 'Van lifted the girl up onto his shoulders.')
(40301, '...?!')
(40302, 'H-Huh?')
('Elaine', 'V-Van? What are you—?')
('Van', "Let's get out of here!")
('System', "Van's group decided to take a short break.")
('System', 'Everyone split up so they could spend their free time<br/>as they pleased.')
('Van', 'Yo. Sorry for the wait.')
('Fie', "Don't worry about it—I just got here myself.<br/>Thanks for coming.")
('Van', "Think nothin' of it. Seems this has to do with one of<br/>my part-timers, so I figured I might as well.")
('Van', "You want me to help out with a memento of the<br/>Flameeater's, right?")
('Fie', 'Yep. I want to fix up the custom rifle that Aida used<br/>to use.')
('Fie', "Seems like you've heard about it already.")
('Van', "Sure have. We tried to get it repaired before, but they<br/>told us it wasn't really feasible.")
('Fie', 'Feri managed to recover it after the incident in Creil.<br/>The one back in September, I mean.')
('Van', 'I assume the two of you found a way to fix it?')
('Fie', "Bingo. We learned what parts we'd need to repair it,<br/>so all that's left is to actually get them.")
('Fie', "It's been bothering me ever since I learned it was<br/>damaged, so I'm glad I can finally do something.")
('Fie', 'I figure things will get really busy once the festival<br/>starts, so I want to get it taken care of before then.')
('Fie', "Feri's working on the stuff that can be gathered<br/>above ground...")
('Van', "While you're gonna be gettin' the underground<br/>stuff—from the Blacklight District, in other words.")
('Van', 'And you want me to show you around the place.')
('Fie', "Exactly. I've heard that nose of yours is really<br/>impressive—so impressive that even Zin relies on it.")
('Fie', 'How about it? You up for being my guide?')
('Van', "Sure, why not? Couldn't hurt puttin' you in my<br/>debt more.")
('Van', "I'd be helpin' one of my part-timers move on, too.<br/>Sounds like a win-win to me.")
('Fie', "Thanks. Let's get moving, then.")
