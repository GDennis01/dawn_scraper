('Inspector Daswani', "We haven't yet found records of the dirt Giacomo<br/>had on people among his belongings, so those are still<br/>out there somewhere.")
('Inspector Daswani', 'I would rather that code have not ended up in your<br/>hands in the first place, but I appreciate your<br/>cooperation all the same.')
('Inspector Daswani', "I hope you continue to be this cooperative with us in<br/>the future—and we don't end up having to put you<br/>behind bars.")
('Inspector Daswani', "You called yourselves 'Arkride Solutions,' if I recall?")
('Inspector Daswani', "I swear, you couldn't be more suspicious if you tried...")
('Inspector Daswani', "...but if you insist that you're worthy of even a<br/>fragment of our trust, go ahead and prove it.")
('Agnès', 'I had no idea this was what it looked like under<br/>the city...')
('Agnès', 'It feels almost surreal to be here.')
('Van', "Don't think most people have any reason to come,<br/>so yeah.")
('Van', "Looks like I'm gonna have to take back what I<br/>said, though.")
('Van', 'Go hang around the stalls outside or something while<br/>I take care of things in here.')
('Agnès', 'Why?')
('Agnès', '...!')
('Van', "There's why. You can find monsters even in the<br/>city—just gotta look under it.")
('Van', 'Though last I heard, the guild would periodically<br/>come and do some spring cleaning...')
('Van', 'Just saying, this is no place for a student. Leave this<br/>part to me.')
('Agnès', "Don't say that...")
('Agnès', "I knew this job wasn't going to be without danger<br/>from the start, so I came prepared for it.")
('Agnès', "So please, won't you take me with you? I won't get in<br/>your way. I promise.")
('Van', 'Huh?')
('Van', "You do know we're not going on a picnic, right?")
('Van', "I know you got a Xipha, but you're gonna need more<br/>than that in a fight.")
('Agnès', "I didn't come with just a combat orbment. I have<br/>this, too.")
('Van', 'Whoa.')
('Agnès', "It's the orbal staff I chose to learn for self-defense<br/>lessons through the academy.")
('Agnès', 'I have experience fighting mock battles with it and<br/>using healing arts. I really do think I can do more<br/>good than harm.')
('Van', 'Mmgh...')
('Van', "Fine. We're short on time, so let's just get movin'.")
('Van', "But if I think you ARE leanin' on harm, you agree to<br/>get out of here. We clear?")
('Van', "It's my job to make sure my client's safe, and I don't<br/>skimp on quality.")
('Agnès', 'I understand! Thank you!')
('Van', '...')
('Agnès', "Do you think these are Giacomo's footprints?")
('Van', "Yeah. Fresh as a few minutes ago, I'd wager.")
('Van', "Which doesn't make sense.")
('Agnès', "...No. No, it doesn't.")
('Agnès', "With all the monsters we've encountered along the<br/>way, he must have encountered some, too.")
('Van', "Yeah. I didn't hear any gunshots either, so he had<br/>to've slipped past them all unnoticed.")
('Van', "And there's only one way he could've done that.")
('Agnès', "What's that?")
('Van', "Don't worry about it. Just somethin' I learned about<br/>in the past.")
('Van', "Anyway, we're almost at his hideout. Stay on guard.")
('Agnès', 'Will do!')
(500, 'Meanwhile...')
('Giacomo (Corpse Version)', 'Ugh...')
('Giacomo (Corpse Version)', "This thing's good shit, but it wears you out like<br/>nothin' else.")
('Giacomo (Corpse Version)', 'Real big upgrade between the fourth and fifth-gen<br/>orbments right here. I can see why the army liked it<br/>so much.')
('Giacomo (Corpse Version)', 'Was worth extorting it out of that corrupt general a<br/>while back.')
('Giacomo (Corpse Version)', 'Hmm... But what am I gonna do now?')
('Giacomo (Corpse Version)', "No one's gonna find the goods now that I've got 'em<br/>well hidden.")
('Giacomo (Corpse Version)', "Now I gotta settle between sellin' it to A for a fat<br/>stack or takin' it to some lab or a tech corp.")
('Giacomo (Corpse Version)', 'That girl with Arkride seemed to know what it was<br/>worth, too...')
('Giacomo (Corpse Version)', "Heh. Wouldn't mind having her work under me if it<br/>meant gettin' him out of the way.")
('Giacomo (Corpse Version)', 'I might be able to tap more than extra mira out of<br/>that dea—')
(40402, "Getting a little ahead of yourself, aren't we?")
('Giacomo (Corpse Version)', '...?!')
('Giacomo (Corpse Version)', 'Wh-What are YOU doing here?!')
(40402, 'So you came here after all.')
(40401, "Not a bad hustle you've got going on.")
(40401, 'You learned what those punks were up to, tipped off<br/>the cops, then snatched the case in the confusion so<br/>you could profit from the shadows.')
('Giacomo (Corpse Version)', 'W-Wait! I-I hear you. I screwed up!')
('Giacomo (Corpse Version)', "I'll give you back what I stole. And mira!<br/>And whatever dirt you wanna know!")
('Giacomo (Corpse Version)', "I-I'd never even think of pickin' a fight with Alm—")
(40402, 'Too late.')
(40401, 'You underestimated us, and for that, you will pay...<br/>with fear.')
('Giacomo (Corpse Version)', 'Eeek!')
('Giacomo (Corpse Version)', 'AAAAAAHH!')
('Van', '...?!')
('Agnès', 'Wh-What was that?')
('Van', 'Giacomo!')
('Van', "C'mon—but stay behind me!")
('Agnès', 'O-Okay!')
('Van', '...')
('Agnès', 'No!')
('Van', '...?!')
('Agnès', "Van! We've got to... He's...!")
('Van', "Save it. He's dead.")
('Agnès', "I can't believe it...")
('Van', "(I can see he tried to resist, but he couldn't stop his<br/>throat from being slit.)")
('Van', "(Wasn't even the usual knife—more like a machete—<br/>and then his left hand is...)")
(40301, 'What are you two doing down here?!')
(40302, "Wh-What in Aidios' name...?")
('Detective Nate', 'Whoa! Look at all that blood!')
('Agnès', '...')
('Van', 'Shit.')
('Inspector Daswani', 'It would be the guy we were just about to ask to come<br/>in and talk to us.')
('Inspector Daswani', "You look like you've found yourself in the middle of a<br/>real mess here.")
('Inspector Daswani', "I hope you're ready to come to the station.")
(40301, 'Crime scene secured at 1:10PM!')
(40302, 'Two important witnesses will volunteer themselves<br/>into custody and accompany us to the Seiden station!')
('Agnès', "I didn't think we would be coming back here<br/>so soon...")
('Agnès', 'The wanted monster is in an area beyond that crime<br/>scene, right?')
('Van', "Yeah—but now that we're here, there was somethin' I<br/>forgot to tell you last time.")
('Van', "So we're going to the charging station nearby first.")
('Agnès', 'All right!')
('Agnès', 'Then the wanted monster is farther down this way?')
('Van', 'Yeah. This part of the underground was all but<br/>abandoned after the subway was constructed.')
('Van', "That's why we're more than likely gonna find tougher<br/>monsters down here.")
('Van', "(...Why does the air down here feel like it's<br/>been disturbed?)")
('Van', 'Get down!')
('Agnès', 'Aaah!')
('Agnès', 'B-Bats?!')
('Van', "They ain't what we're here for, but it looks like a<br/>whole host of 'em have made themselves at home.")
('Van', "Ugh. If I'd known this was what we were gonna find,<br/>I'd have come ready for it.")
('Agnès', '...!')
('Van', "Bah. I think we're gonna have to—")
('Dingo', 'Shield your eyes for a sec.')
('Agnès', 'Huh?')
('Van', 'Heh. Got it!')
('Agnès', '...?!')
('Agnès', '...!<br/>(A camera flash?)')
('Dingo', "That's half of 'em!")
('Van', "Got it! Then let's get the other half!")
('Agnès', 'A-All right!')
('Van', "Whew... Huh. Surprised that didn't take more<br/>outta you.")
('Agnès', "I'm fine, yes.")
('Dingo', 'Good to hear.')
('Agnès', 'Were you the one who used that flash?')
('Agnès', "Wait! You're Van's friend!")
('Dingo', "The name's Dingo Brad. Me and Van go way back.")
('Dingo', "I'm a reporter with Meld Magazine.")
('Agnès', "Oh, wow. That's quite a well-known magazine.")
('Van', 'Covers everything from entertainment gossip to<br/>political sleaze to even the occult.')
('Van', "Buzzraider's the star of the show these days, but<br/>Meld's a classic that goes ways back.")
('Van', "Surprised you've heard of 'em. I didn't think an honor<br/>student like you would be into that kind of stuff.")
('Agnès', "I-I'm not!")
('Agnès', "I just happen to have a friend who loves it. I've only<br/>read...a little.")
('Dingo', '*sigh* You should tell that friend of yours to give<br/>it up.')
('Dingo', "Meld's not for Aramis students to read, Ms. Claudel.")
('Van', "He didn't learn it from me. Must've figured it out on<br/>his own.")
('Dingo', "I'm no Bermotti, but I'm in the same trade on<br/>the side.")
('Dingo', "Your name is the extent of what I know, though—<br/>don't worry.")
('Agnès', "I-I don't mind. You seem like a close friend of Van's,<br/>so I'm sure you can be trusted.")
('Agnès', 'Thank you for helping us.')
('Van', "Didn't take long to turn her around. That's what<br/>being so damn handsome gets you.")
('Van', "Just as we finally got even, though, I'm already back<br/>in your debt.")
('Van', "What're you even doing down here? Something else<br/>pop up around Giacomo?")
('Dingo', "Nope. I'm not here for work.")
('Dingo', "You didn't pass anyone on your way here, did you?")
('Dingo', "I know you're taking care of a monster for the guild,<br/>but I figured I'd ask.")
('Agnès', 'H-How did you...?')
('Van', 'Course you already know. ...Wait a sec.')
('Van', "You're tellin' me someone else is down here with us?")
('Dingo', 'Yeah. A civilian, at that.')
('Dingo', 'Twenty-year-old female. No combat experience.')
('Agnès', 'Th-That is very worrying...')
('Van', 'Wait a minute.')
('Van', "It's not that rookie reporter from the Tyrell Times,<br/>is it?")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "I'm Marielle Aymé, the newest reporter with the<br/>Tyrell Times!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "You wouldn't happen to have anything to add about<br/>the murder, would you?! I'll take anything!")
('Agnès', 'The woman we met outside the police station?')
('Dingo', "Wish you were wrong, but that's the one.")
('Dingo', "I'd resigned myself to look for her alone, but you<br/>happened to show up at the perfect time.")
('Dingo', 'Mind giving me a hand?')
('Van', '*sigh* Well, it would put us back at even again...')
('Van', "'Sides, I get the feeling this might be my fault.")
('Agnès', '...What?')
('Dingo', 'About a fifth of it, sure.')
('Dingo', "She has a very competitive streak, and for some<br/>reason, she's pegged me as her rival.")
('Dingo', 'The whole reason she charged into the police station<br/>the other day was to get one up over me.')
('Dingo', "I'm sure you can guess how well that went.")
('Van', 'Bah. Yeah... I kinda feel bad now.')
('Agnès', 'Umm... Then...')
('Agnès', "...because Van gave her the wrong information, her<br/>report didn't work out.")
('Agnès', 'So she grew frustrated and stormed right into danger<br/>in hopes of finding something worthwhile?')
('Agnès', 'Th-Then what are we waiting for?! We should go<br/>save her before something terrible happens!')
('Van', "We're gonna! That's what I was sayin'!")
('Van', "But we didn't see any sign of her on our way here, so<br/>she's gotta be farther in.")
('Dingo', "I wish I could help in battle, but the only weapon I've<br/>got is my camera. I'll have to lean on you two.")
('Dingo', "I just hope she hasn't made it all the way to where<br/>that wanted monster is...")
('Agnès', "I-I don't think the ordinary monsters here are any<br/>better for a civilian...")
('Agnès', "B-But we need to hurry! She's in real danger!")
('Agnès', "(It's time to show Van all I've learned from my battles<br/>so far!)")
('Agnès', "(I can't keep leaving most of the work to him forever.<br/>I need to be more proactive!)")
('System', 'Agnès learned the S-Craft <br/>.')
('System', 'Dingo is now accompanying the duo.')
('Dingo', '...!')
('Agnès', 'Oh, no!')
('Van', 'The hell?')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Nooo! Let—Let GO of meee!')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Don't eat me! I-I taste awful!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Hey! Watch where you're t-touching!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Being eaten by a monster in a place like this is such a<br/>craptacular way to die...')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Aidios! Mom! Dad! DINGOOO!')
('Dingo', 'You got some luck on you!')
('Dingo', "Haaah! You're up, Van!")
('Van', 'I got you!')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Huh? The monster turned into Dingo?')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Then maybe being eaten wouldn't be so bad after all.")
('Dingo', "This is no time for daydreaming! We're movin' back!")
('Van', 'Looks like you got this!')
('Van', "Let's finish 'em off!")
('Agnès', 'Right!')
('System', 'Found <br/>.')
('System', 'Found <br/>.')
('Agnès', 'Whew... We made it in time.')
('Van', 'Not bad. Not bad.')
('Van', "Guess fightin' a huge hunk of slime isn't fun for a<br/>girl, huh?")
('Agnès', "I-It's no different from any other monster! I just need<br/>to steel myself beforehand...")
('Agnès', 'But never mind that.')
('Dingo', "You okay? Looks like you didn't sprain your ankles,<br/>at least.")
(40301, "I-I'm fine...but what are you doing here?")
(40301, 'Oh, I know! You must be here to steal my scoop!')
('Dingo', '*sigh* Not even close.')
('Dingo', "Giacomo's murder has already been solved.<br/>The CID's on the case, and it already has the culprits<br/>in custody.")
('Dingo', 'Your editor-in-chief is already up to speed, too.')
(40301, 'What?')
(40301, 'Th-Then I just got scarred for life for no reason?')
('Agnès', "Oh, you're a mess! Poor thing...")
(40301, "Wh-Who are you? ...Wait. I've seen you before...")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Eeeeeek! Wh-What happened to my clothes?!')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Don't look at me! E-Especially you, Dingo!")
('Dingo', '*sigh* Fine...')
('Van', 'You should be glad your clothes are the only thing<br/>that got messed up.')
('Van', "Dingo wasn't wrong about you havin' some luck.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'GLAD?! Do you even know how embarrassing it is<br/>to be seen like—')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Hey! I know you!')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "You're that shady spriggan who solved that case!")
('Van', 'Well...')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Oh, you don't know the hell I went through because<br/>of that nonsense you fed me!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'I got in hot water with the cops, I ended up missing<br/>the end of the case...')
('Van', 'If it helps, I...kinda feel bad about it?')
('Van', "But you sure you wanna get up in another dude's face<br/>lookin' like that?")
('Van', 'Save the view for Dingo.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Mmgrr...!')
('Agnès', 'Really, Van...')
('Dingo', "Well, you're not going to find any scoops<br/>here anymore.")
('Dingo', "This is no place for a reporter to be. Let's get you out<br/>of here so you can get changed.")
('Dingo', 'Thanks for the help. I owe you both big.')
('Agnès', 'Oh, not at all.')
('Van', "She ended up here 'cause of me, so we're all good.<br/>Safe trip back.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "H-Hold on! I'm not done talking to him!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Augh! You better believe this isn't the last you'll see<br/>of me, spriggan!")
('Agnès', 'Umm... So...')
('Van', "Well, the guild's request has been taken care of, and<br/>the only damages sustained were to an eager<br/>reporter's wardrobe and ego.")
('Van', "I'm calling this a job well done.")
('Agnès', '*sigh* Even if you made an enemy out of her along<br/>the way...')
('Agnès', "...but I suppose all's well that ends well.")
('Agnès', 'Does that do it for the day, then?')
('Van', "Not yet. We're still clocked in until we're back at the<br/>office—so let's get outta here.")
('System', 'Quest Underground Fumigation completed!')
('Van', 'There they are!')
('Shizuna', "Along with the demon sphere we've been looking for.")
('Fie', 'Along with a demon sphere just like the one in<br/>Old Town!')
('Cao', 'Along with our demon sphere!')
('Aaron', 'Ugh... *pant* I am so sick of this shit right now.')
('Kincaid', "Keep a cool head, Wei. These may be a challenge, but<br/>they're a challenge we can handle.")
('Kincaid', "Do you intend to let all you've learned under Van go<br/>to waste?")
('Aaron', "I don't need you to tell me that, desk jockey!")
('Van', 'Aaron! René!')
('Aaron', 'Van...?!')
('Aaron', 'Van! Small fry! Maid!')
('Aaron', 'Van! Small fry!')
('Aaron', 'Van! Maid!')
('Feri', "I'm so glad we made it in time!")
('Risette', "Though I'm sure you would be fine without our aid,<br/>we're here to lend it all the same!")
('Kincaid', "I suspected you would show up about now, but I<br/>didn't think it would be with the Divine Blade<br/>of Silver.")
('Shizuna', 'Well, here I am.')
('Kincaid', "I suspected you would show up about now, but I<br/>didn't think you would have the guild's rising<br/>star with you.")
('Fie', 'Good to see you again.')
('Kincaid', "I suspected you would show up about now, but I<br/>didn't think you would have someone from Heiyue<br/>with you.")
('Cao', 'Oh, we have many a debt to repay to you, after all.')
('Aaron', "Well, I could've taken out these things just fine<br/>without you guys...")
('Aaron', "...but I'm gonna hurl if I see them for another minute,<br/>so let's just get this over with!")
('Van', "Heh. A simple 'thanks' would do the job just fine!")
('Kincaid', "Forward, everyone! Let's make this quick!")
('Van', 'Whew... That takes care of that.')
('Shizuna', "Looks like we've severed the connection between the<br/>sphere and the devils, too.")
('Fie', "Looks like we've severed the connection between the<br/>sphere and the devils.")
('Cao', 'That sphere will supply power no longer.')
('Kincaid', "Hmm... It's almost as if they're sub-devices to<br/>whatever is causing this event.")
('Van', '...You might be right on the money with<br/>that comparison.')
('Kincaid', '...?')
('Van', "Well, looks like that was a close call, but I'm glad we<br/>managed to turn it around.")
('Van', "As your chief, I'll give you a pat on the back this time.")
('Aaron', '*pant* Oh, screw you. Saying that kinda crap is why I<br/>call you old.')
('Van', "Wh-What's so old about that?")
('Aaron', "Anyway, after that creepy-ass call and all that's<br/>happened since, we know what we've gotta be doing.")
('Aaron', "So quit it with the big talk and just be happy you've<br/>got me on the team again.")
('Aaron', "'Cause I've got the strength of a hundred decrepit<br/>farts like you.")
('Van', 'You little punk...')
('Feri', "Ahaha... Things just aren't the same without the<br/>Aaron we know and love.")
('Risette', 'He is correct that our next course of action is<br/>clear, however.')
('Cao', "(Heh. How he's grown.)")
('Kincaid', "All right, then, let's get back to the café and bar<br/>for now.")
('Agnès', 'Giacomo...died here.')
('Van', "I guess the cops are all done with their investigation.<br/>Even the blood's gone.")
('Agnès', "I don't recall seeing anything regarding this incident<br/>in the news, now that I think about it.")
('Van', "I mean, the perp was caught. With A involved, that's<br/>probably as far as anyone's willing to go.")
('Van', "People will forget eventually—even the ones<br/>that cared. This isn't the sorta case you tie up with a<br/>neat little bow.")
('Agnès', "That's...sad.")
('Van', "Look, no one forced him to go stick his nose<br/>in A's business. He got greedy, and this is the<br/>result.")
('Van', "Considerin' all the crap he's always been up to, I'd say<br/>he got what was comin'. You gotta grow a thicker<br/>skin, or you ain't survivin' this job.")
('Agnès', '...')
('Van', "Though...I guess it's just as good to not be jaded.")
('Van', "Maybe don't go growin' a thicker skin. It's best if you<br/>don't get too used to all the shit that goes on in the<br/>darker side of society.")
('Agnès', '(Van...)')
('Van', "That newbie's got some real obsession with<br/>you, y'know.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Just you wait, Dingo! I'll get one over you this time!")
('Van', "What's goin' on between you two anyway?")
('Agnès', 'You said earlier she sees you as her rival. Do you<br/>happen to know why?')
('Dingo', 'Your guess is as good as mine. Maybe she just likes<br/>having a bit of friendly competition with other people<br/>in the industry.')
('Dingo', 'Why do you ask, anyway?')
('Agnès', 'Oh, umm, no reason. Sorry.')
('Dingo', "Don't be. It's not like I have anything to hide.")
('Dingo', 'Guess I can tell you the story. This happened right<br/>after Marielle joined the Tyrell Times.')
('Dingo', "She'd set off on some noble crusade against a politician<br/>with a rather—let's just say—unsavory reputation.")
('Dingo', 'And when he caught wind of what she was doing, he<br/>started threatening her.')
('Van', 'Ah, the righteous young journalist who ends up<br/>vanishing into the darkness she thought she<br/>could fight...')
('Van', "Tale as old as time. 'Course, it didn't pan out<br/>that way this time, and I'm assuming you're<br/>the reason why.")
('Dingo', 'Guilty as charged. I just so happened to have some<br/>dirt on said politician.')
('Dingo', "It wasn't big or anything. Not really worth calling it a<br/>scoop, so I packed it up and sent it over to Marielle.")
('Dingo', 'And she did exactly as I expected and went public<br/>with that info.')
('Agnès', 'What happened after that?')
('Dingo', 'Long story short: nothing.')
('Dingo', "Like I said, it wasn't anything major. Not the<br/>kinda dirt that'd get you a hit piece.")
('Dingo', "Hence why most journalists wouldn't bother writing<br/>up something like that.")
('Van', "But Marielle isn't most journalists. That girl's<br/>as green as they come.")
('Dingo', "True. But that politician didn't realize that.")
('Dingo', "He convinced himself that Marielle must have some<br/>real dirt on him, or she never would've gone public<br/>with something so insignificant.")
('Dingo', 'He took it as her trying to propose a truce.')
('Dingo', 'After that, he stopped messing with her.')
('Agnès', 'So, when you sent her that information, was that<br/>the outcome you were hoping for?')
('Dingo', "That's right. Though, admittedly, I never thought<br/>it'd turn out as well as it did.")
('Dingo', "For whatever reason, Lady Luck's taken a real<br/>shine to that girl.")
('Dingo', 'She sticks her nose into danger over and over,<br/>and yet every time, she comes out of it without<br/>so much as a scratch.')
('Dingo', 'Guess she was just born under the right stars.')
('Agnès', 'I-I see.')
('Van', "Sounds like a real agent of chaos to me. I know<br/>the type; they're always makin' messes that<br/>everyone else has to mop up later.")
('Dingo', "That's her, all right. And right now, we're the<br/>cleanup crew.")
('Dingo', "So let's get to her before she goes and makes yet<br/>another mess.")
('Agnès', "If you think about it, Dingo, you've helped Marielle<br/>quite a lot, haven't you?")
('Agnès', 'Why would she consider you a rival, then?')
('Agnès', "(If anything, you'd think she'd fancy him instead.)")
('Dingo', "I mean, it wasn't always like that.")
('Dingo', "But after the whole deal with the politician,<br/>she became weirdly...fixated on me. She<br/>just won't leave me alone.")
('Van', 'Okay, pretty boy. Rein it in with the flexing.')
('Dingo', 'I had to tell her that she should probably not be so<br/>friendly with the competition.')
('Dingo', "That's how she found out I work for Meld, actually.<br/>It was quite a shock for her.")
('Agnès', 'Oh.')
('Van', 'So she realized the amazing journalist she looked up<br/>to so much works for a trashy gossip rag.')
('Van', 'Look at you, breaking that righteous little heart<br/>of hers.')
('Dingo', "Anyway, you'd think she'd just leave it at that and<br/>cut contact.")
('Dingo', "Instead, she pivoted into talking about<br/>course-correction and 'making me a proper journalist.'<br/>Now she's playing my rival, too, for whatever reason.")
('Dingo', "Joke's on me, because that just made her follow me<br/>around even more now.")
('Agnès', "I see... Though for as annoyed as you look, you can't<br/>just turn a blind eye to her, either.")
('Agnès', "You care about her enough that you would've gone in<br/>after her, even if you were alone, right?")
('Dingo', "Hmph. Well, in some Goddess-forsaken way, it's<br/>my responsibility. The least I could do is keep an eye<br/>on her.")
('Dingo', "I'd bet your boss here would do much the same.")
('Van', "Nah, I don't do babysitting.")
('Van', "I don't mind helpin' her this time, but that's only<br/>'cause I'm already here for that wanted monster.")
('Van', "And speakin' of wanted monster, how 'bout we<br/>hurry up?")
('Agnès', "Sure. We haven't found her yet, after all.")
('Dingo', 'She must be deeper in still. Sorry for all the bother,<br/>but thanks for helping out with this.')
('Feri', "Hmm? I heard something from the room ahead of us.<br/>There's...people inside.")
('Feri', "Several people. Maybe it's...")
('Agnès', 'Almata? I hope not...')
('Van', 'Nah, I doubt it. Probably just exactly who we wanna<br/>see here.')
('Van', "Let's head in.")
('Van', 'Hello there, officers.')
('Van', "How you likin' this spot? You come by here often.<br/>Hope you found what you're lookin' for.")
('Inspector Daswani', "I should be asking you that question. What's a punk<br/>like you doing in here?")
('Inspector Daswani', 'And you brought a child along this time.')
('Inspector Daswani', 'There is a police investigation underway here.<br/>Civilians are not allowed on the premises.')
('Van', "Aww, come on. Don't be like that.")
('Van', 'I just stopped by on a job.')
('Van', 'Guess you guys are looking for something, too, huh?')
('Inspector Daswani', "If you already know, then why are you asking? It's not<br/>like I'll tell you anything else, either.")
('Inspector Daswani', "Why don't you just go ahead and tell me what kinda<br/>job you're taking that brought you back here, of<br/>all places.")
('Inspector Daswani', "This doesn't have to be a questioning, though I don't<br/>mind taking you along to the station for an interview.<br/>Voluntarily, of course.")
('Van', "Hey, whoa! Hold up there. I ain't tryin' to pick<br/>a fight.")
('Van', 'We got our own business around here.')
('Van', "What do you say I scratch your back and help you<br/>look for whatever it is you're trying to find?")
('Van', "Who knows? Maybe an outsider's perspective will<br/>help things along better than you could, Inspector.")
('Van', "And, of course, we'll tell you about anything we find.<br/>No secrets here.")
('Agnès', "I know we're asking for a lot, but please consider<br/>making an exception this time!")
('Feri', "Of course! We won't get in your way, Inspector!")
('Feri', 'I can even go out and clean up the waterway monsters<br/>so things are a little safer here!')
('Inspector Daswani', "As in...you're going to fight them?")
('Van', '(Damn it, kid. Maybe let me handle this one.)')
('Van', 'Ahem... Anyway, please? You can trust me a little on<br/>this one.')
('Van', 'If supervision would make you feel better, you can<br/>always have someone watch us.')
('Inspector Daswani', "You're shameless, thinking you can come in and just<br/>ask for me to trust you. Just like that.")
('Inspector Daswani', '...And yet the CID trusts you—if ever so slightly.')
('Inspector Daswani', "I'd quite like to find out just what about you<br/>is worthy of that trust. Assuming there's anything<br/>at all.")
('Feri', 'Can we go in, then?')
('Inspector Daswani', "Yes, but if you so much as twitch in a suspicious way,<br/>I'll have cuffs on you before you even notice. Let us<br/>know if you find anything.")
('Agnès', 'Thank you so much, Inspector!')
('Van', "Okay. 'Scuse us, then.")
('Van', "It's a flyer for the taco stand.")
('Agnès', 'Come to think of it, we met Giacomo right in front<br/>of that taco stand.')
('Agnès', 'You mentioned he was a regular there, usually<br/>on Wednesdays.')
('Feri', 'Tacos... Mmm, I could go for a taco right now!')
('Feri', "I wonder what I should get. Their menu's on the back<br/>of the flyer, yeah?")
('System', 'Feri tugged on the taco stand flyer.')
('Feri', "I-I can't get it off! It's stuck to the wall and all I can<br/>lift is this corner!")
('Agnès', 'Oh! Wait, hold on!')
('Agnès', "Look, there's something written in the corner here.<br/>Is this a code of some sort?")
('Feri', "You're right!")
('Van', 'Good one there, Ferida. Now let me take a look.')
('System', "'No/R4G6B7F7Z1P8S10' is written in tiny letters on<br/>the back of the flyer.")
('Agnès', 'I...have no idea what this means.')
('Van', "Yep. No clue, either. This one's not gonna be an easy<br/>one to decipher.")
('Van', "We're gonna need a key to decipher the code in the<br/>first place.")
('Feri', "Ah, I think I know what to do with the 'No/'!")
('Feri', "The other code has a '/te', and if we put them<br/>together, it says note! As in notebook!")
('Agnès', "You're right!")
('Agnès', "It doesn't necessarily mean that this leads to the<br/>book we're looking for, but at the very least, they're<br/>connected. That's a good start.")
('Van', "We need to figure out the remaining code and what<br/>the '203' meant.")
('Van', 'Man. A taco flyer is a whack place to put a code on.')
('Van', "Dude must've been real hardcore about his tacos to<br/>come up with something like this. He did go<br/>every week...")
('Agnès', 'Haha, yeah...')
('Inspector Daswani', "Isn't it nice to see you three having so much fun in<br/>our crime scene? ...Well? Did you find anything?")
('Inspector Daswani', "I'll remind you that tampering with evidence is a<br/>crime punishable by law, but you might just look nice<br/>behind bars and in a prison suit.")
('Van', 'Hey, cool it there. We were just about to show you.')
('Van', 'Take a look for yourself. Giacomo left some sort of<br/>code on here.')
('Inspector Daswani', "Hmm... I do see that something's written, but are you<br/>sure it's a code?")
('Van', 'Sure? No. Not until I decode it, anyway.')
('Inspector Daswani', "All right. Guess you're not just talk, then.")
('Inspector Daswani', 'Hate to say it, but you did help in our investigation.')
('Van', "Heh, nice. If I get to earn a favor from the cops, then<br/>that's a win in my book.")
('Van', "I found what I was looking for, so we'll be<br/>leavin' now.")
('Inspector Daswani', "Hold up. Don't think you can play me for a fool here.<br/>I've got an idea as to what you're after.")
('Inspector Daswani', 'Let me ask you this: What will you do with it once<br/>you find it?')
('Van', "Hmm? Got no idea what you're talkin'<br/>about, Inspector.")
('Inspector Daswani', "Don't play coy with me. We're all well aware<br/>Giacomo had a thing for collecting information for<br/>blackmailing purposes.")
('Inspector Daswani', "We've so far been unable to locate said information.<br/>It wasn't with any of his possessions.")
('Inspector Daswani', "It's a safe assumption on our part that he might've<br/>had such info hidden somewhere in the city.")
('Inspector Daswani', 'That code might very well lead us to at least part of<br/>that information, once solved.')
('Inspector Daswani', "I know what you're on about, so let's not play any<br/>games here, spriggan.")
('Van', "Sorry, but I can't go tattlin' on a client.")
('Van', "I got a job to do here, and my own rules to stick by as<br/>a spriggan. I have to put my client's wishes first<br/>and foremost.")
('Van', "Whether it's in the best interest of the police or not,<br/>that's not really any of my business.")
('Inspector Daswani', "Hmph. All right. But I'll be keeping an eye on you,<br/>and making sure you don't use Giacomo's<br/>secrets for anything...problematic.")
('Inspector Daswani', "You do, and I'll be more than happy to be the one<br/>to throw you behind bars. I think that's as much<br/>justification as I need.")
('Inspector Daswani', 'Regardless, thank you for your assistance,<br/>Arkride Solutions.')
('Inspector Daswani', "I'll pray to the Goddess that you continue being this<br/>cooperative with the police in the future.")
('Van', 'Yeah, yeah.')
('Feri', 'Umm... Sorry for bothering you, and thanks!')
('Agnès', 'Thank you for your assistance, too, Inspector.')
('Van', "Okay, back to business. Time to crack this little riddle<br/>out, and figure out what the hell<br/>'R4G6B7F7Z1P8S10' means.")
('Van', "Okay. Still not sure this code's gonna take us to<br/>wherever this blackmail book is, but we gotta keep<br/>at it.")
('Van', "Nothin' else really caught my eye in his hideout.<br/>I don't think we're gonna find anything else, even if<br/>we keep looking.")
('Van', "Worse comes to worst, we can still check his other<br/>hideout, but it'd be real swell if we could figure things<br/>out here.")
('Agnès', "We need a key to solve this, don't we?")
('Feri', "I didn't see any more hints. I don't know what to do...")
('Agnès', "Maybe we're missing something? Like in his hideout<br/>or something. There was his sofa, the liquor bottles,<br/>several containers...")
('Agnès', "...and there's the taco stand flyer where Feri found<br/>the code.")
('Van', "Hmm... The taco stand flyer... Might be a lead worth<br/>lookin' into.")
('Van', 'He was real fond of that taco joint. Hell, the code<br/>itself was on the flyer.')
('Van', "I don't think it's just a coincidence. That's not the<br/>kinda guy Giacomo was. He was very cautious.")
('Feri', "Then let's go to the taco stand!")
('Agnès', "Back to Riverside's, umm, riverside!")
('System', "The container is damaged, but it doesn't look like it's<br/>a clue.")
('Agnès', 'I was wondering if maybe all these scrapes<br/>meant something...')
('Van', 'I get the thought process, but they look just like<br/>normal wear and tear to me.')
('Van', "Let's keep checkin' around.")
('Feri', "Oh, maybe there's a code in the carpet! It has this<br/>funky pattern to it!")
('Van', "That's an idea. Would be cool if it's true.")
('Van', "One issue is we don't really have a way of knowin'<br/>unless we get a clue about it.")
('Van', 'So... Why are we down here?')
('Van', "*sigh* Whatever. Just don't run off on your own while<br/>we're down here, okay?")
('Lyla', 'Sure!')
('Lyla', 'Umm, the hair ties should probably be in the back!')
('Lyla', "Come on! Let's get looking!")
('Van', 'Yeah, yeah.')
('Van', '(She dropped those hair ties HERE, of all places?)')
('Van', "(I ain't buyin' it, but she's just a kid. A sweet one<br/>at that. Doesn't look like she's tryin' to play me<br/>or anything.)")
('Van', '(Dunno what her goal is, but the only way to find out<br/>is to stick with her, I guess.)')
('Van', "(There'll be monsters down in the sewers. With her<br/>in tow, I better not pick any fights.)")
('System', 'Quest Lost and Found started!')
('Lyla', "Umm... Oh! Okay, let's cross the bridge!")
('Lyla', "Yay, this is fun! We're going on an adventure!")
('Van', "Hey! There's monsters over there! Get back here!")
('Lyla', "I'm fine, heehee! Don't worry about me!")
('Van', '(What the hell?)')
('Van', 'Shit.')
('Lyla', "Wow, mister! You're so strong!")
('Van', "I told you not to run off on your own.<br/>There's monsters in here.")
('Van', 'Stick close to me, okay?')
('Lyla', 'Sure!')
('Van', "I'll take your word for it, then.")
('Van', '(The hell is going on?)')
('Van', '(All of the monsters we came across along the way<br/>have been acting the same.)')
('Van', "(Are they bein' weird, or is she the oddball? Man, I<br/>hope I'm just overthinking it.)")
('Lyla', "Aww, they're not here.")
('Lyla', "Let's keep going!")
('Van', "(We're pretty far in now. Good time as ever to ask a<br/>few questions.)")
('Van', "Are you sure we're going the right way?")
('Van', "You're pretty chill, even with all the monsters around.<br/>Have you been here before?")
('Lyla', "Umm... I dunno! I'm not sure where they are, but<br/>I'm just letting my feet guide me!")
('Lyla', "Maybe they're really far in! There was a lot of water<br/>last time...")
('Van', "Lot of water, huh? Now that's pretty interesting.")
('Van', "Because we haven't had a downpour bad enough to<br/>flood the river in months.")
('Van', "So, let's get down to brass tacks. You're taking<br/>me to the end of the tunnel. Why?")
('Lyla', '...')
('Lyla', "*sniffle* I-I know what I'm talking about! I know<br/>I'm right!")
('Lyla', 'The river was so, so full of water and it washed<br/>the hair ties away!')
('Lyla', "They got carried all the way to the end but there<br/>was a really scary thing in the way and I couldn't<br/>get them back!")
('Van', "Scary thing? And it's at the end of the tunnel?")
('Lyla', 'U-Umm...')
('Lyla', "N-No, there's no scary thing! Nothing to be<br/>scared about!")
('Van', '*sigh* Okay, whatever.')
('Van', "I feel like if I start pokin' holes into your story, I'm<br/>just gonna be here till dawn. Let's just get it over with.")
('Van', 'Come on. Show me the scary thing.')
('Lyla', 'O-Okay!')
('Lyla', "Th-They're here!")
('Lyla', "But I can't get them back with that scary guy<br/>in here!")
('Van', 'Yeah, I can see how that would be scary for a kid.')
('Van', 'You can get them back once I get rid of it, yeah?')
('Lyla', "Y-Yeah... I'm sorry, mister. Please don't get hurt!")
('System', 'Found <br/>.')
('Van', 'All right. That should do it.')
('Lyla', "Wh-Whoa, mister, you're so cool! Thank you for<br/>getting rid of it!")
('Lyla', 'Umm... The hair ties should be right here!')
('Lyla', "Here! It's Laura's hair ties!")
('Van', 'Huh. I half figured you were lying about the hair ties.')
('Lyla', "That's mean! I told you I wasn't lying!")
('Van', "Maybe, but you weren't entirely honest, either.")
('Van', "Man, they look pretty clean still. They handmade?<br/>'Cause they look like they had a lot of effort put<br/>into them.")
('Lyla', 'Yeah, I know! My little sister put her whole heart<br/>into it.')
('Van', "So? You gonna tell me why your sister's hair ties were<br/>down here?")
('Lyla', 'Okay... We had a big family trip that day.')
('Lyla', 'My sister and I swapped our handmade hair ties with<br/>each other for fun.')
('Lyla', 'But it was really, really rainy, and...')
('Lyla', "...and I lost them. It's my fault that Laura's been so<br/>sad this whole time.")
('Lyla', 'I wanted to give them back to her, no matter what.')
('Van', 'I could tell. You did look genuinely worried about<br/>your sister from the start.')
('Van', "But there's still something you haven't told me, yeah?")
('Lyla', "Heehee... Yeah. You're right.")
('Lyla', "I'm really sorry, mister. Please take this. I'm counting<br/>on you!")
('Van', '...')
('Van', 'Ah, man. She drags me all the way down here and<br/>still dumps more work on my lap.')
('Van', "But I guess it'll be worth the effort if it means she'll<br/>pass on peacefully to Aidios' side.")
('Van', "I guess I'll head back to the surface for now.")
('System', 'Van received the handmade hair ties.')
('System', 'A fearsome foe is prowling around.')
('System', 'Found <br/>.')
('System', 'Quest Underground Fumigation 2 completed!')
('System', 'Received')
('System', 'Van and Renne started looking into any suspicious<br/>information they found relating to Aramis.')
('System', 'With Renne having already identified a few leads of<br/>her own, the investigation proceeded smoothly.')
('System', 'Soon they found out what group—and who—was<br/>behind everything.')
(40301, "Okay, now that the plan is settled, all that's left is to<br/>take action during their school trip.")
(40302, 'Remember that we are only helping you because our<br/>boss trusts your plan to work. This better go off<br/>without a hitch.')
(40301, 'Of course it will.')
(40301, "Just follow the plan, and soon we'll be rolling in<br/>ransom dough!")
(40301, "Am I not a part of the Dolor Family? It's my<br/>responsibility to see things through.")
(40301, "Heh heh, and that's not all.")
(40301, 'If students continue getting kidnapped, the Student<br/>Council president will have to involve herself<br/>soon enough.')
(40301, 'The situation will soon demolish her reputation, and<br/>as she lay in shambles, we can lure her in with the<br/>kidnapped students!')
(40301, 'Ahahahaha! I will finally be able to exact revenge on<br/>that accursed Renne Bright!')
(40301, "I'm certain my father will be most pleased when he<br/>hears about this!")
('Renne', "My, Ronald. You're a devoted man, aren't you?<br/>I'm most amazed you still remember me, after all<br/>this time.")
('Van', "I ain't so sure that a daddy's boy like him is the kinda<br/>fan club you'd wanna have after you.")
(40301, 'Wh-What in the world are YOU doing here?!')
('Renne', 'I had my suspicions that you would be the one pulling<br/>the strings here, Ronald Griffith.')
('Van', "Oh, huh. That jogs my memory a little. I've indirectly<br/>dealt with this brat before.")
('Van', "This your former classmate, yeah? The one that had a<br/>bone to pick with you and ended up gettin' expelled<br/>after tryin' to mess with you.")
('Renne', 'The very same. You were most helpful digging up<br/>information on his father at the time, even if it was<br/>through our mutual reporter acquaintance.')
('Renne', 'I must extend my thanks again for assisting me then.')
(40301, "You two have NO idea what hell you put us through<br/>after you ruined my father's career!")
('Renne', "No, I don't. And I couldn't care less, either.")
('Van', "You two were just askin' for it.")
(40301, 'Ugh...')
('Renne', 'So let me recapitulate here. Your grand plan was to<br/>engineer a series of kidnappings to, as you put it,<br/>enact your revenge on me?')
('Renne', 'What a tedious and oblique way of going about<br/>things you have.')
('Van', "Give him SOME credit. His brain might not be<br/>turnin' on right after what you did to him.")
('Van', 'Probably scared him shitless of a face to<br/>face confrontation.')
('Renne', 'You strike a good point there.')
(40301, "D-Don't make fun of me!")
(40301, 'Me joining the Dolor Family was all so I could make<br/>you pay!')
(40301, "We're a mafia with roots dating back to the very<br/>history of the Republic! We are not to be<br/>messed with!")
(40301, "So don't you DARE underestimate me!")
('Van', "Man. There's a name I haven't heard in a while.")
('Renne', 'I would say the Dolor Family figures in at about the<br/>third largest mafia in the Republic.')
('Renne', 'They vied for the second spot years ago, just behind<br/>Heiyue. Back then they held an immense amount<br/>of power.')
('Renne', "However, Almata's recent moves have managed to<br/>displace them from their zone of influence, and they<br/>haven't been as active as a result.")
(40303, "Sh-Shut up! I don't wanna hear Almata's name<br/>anywhere in relation to us!")
('Renne', 'Oh, my. Is Almata yet another sore spot for you?<br/>My apologies, that was so inconsiderate of me.')
(40304, 'You bitches are really asking for it now!')
(40301, 'I might have to fast track things now, but you falling<br/>straight into my hands must be a blessing from<br/>Aidios herself!')
(40301, "Thank you for saving me the trouble. To show my<br/>gratitude, I'll give you a demonstration of the true<br/>darkness this world is capable of!")
('Renne', 'Heehee...')
(40301, "Wh-What's so damn funny?!")
('Renne', "Pardon me, Ronald. I couldn't quite help myself.<br/>Such a cute declaration to make towards me, of<br/>all people. You're out of your depth.")
('Renne', 'Shall we, spriggan?')
('Van', "*sigh* Fine. But I ain't doin' all the work here.")
('Renne', "You needn't worry. I've a message I need them to<br/>hear loud and clear. You don't ever try to harm<br/>my students.")
(40301, "Heh, you don't scare me! It won't take me ten<br/>minutes with you until every bone in your body is<br/>crying in pain!")
(40301, "Y-You've gotta be shitting me! We're... We're<br/>real mafia!")
(40301, "Those gangsters from last year were NOTHING<br/>compared to us! So...HOW?! We didn't even get a<br/>scratch in!")
('Renne', 'You were right about one thing. It did, indeed, take<br/>less than ten minutes.')
(40302, 'N-Now that I think about it, I remember one of our<br/>grunts talking about getting their shit kicked in by a<br/>student before!')
(40303, "Shit! I think this is that Arkride dude that's been<br/>making waves all over!")
(40304, "Wait, the one that's been messin' with Almata?!<br/>What the hell is he doin' here?!")
(40302, "This ain't no joke! We got no chance against him!")
(40303, 'R-Run, everyone!')
('Van', "Gonna guess they were pretty low on the family's<br/>pecking order, but I still expected them to put up a<br/>better fight.")
(40301, 'W-Wait, please!')
('Renne', 'What was it, Ronald, that you said before?')
('Renne', 'Oh, I know! Something about demonstrating the true<br/>darkness this world is capable of!')
(40301, 'A-Ah...')
('Renne', "The sheer audacity to even dare utter that.<br/>You, who's never had the courage to truly gaze at the<br/>abyss and have it stare back at you.")
('Renne', "Maybe it's about time I show you the true despair of<br/>that darkness.")
(40301, '...')
('Renne', "Oh, dear! We've reached the same outcome as before.<br/>I expected all the bravado to take him further<br/>this time.")
('Van', "At least we managed to clean up last time's leftovers,<br/>so things should be spick and span from here on.")
('Renne', "That we have. I must thank you again for your help.<br/>That's one more time to add to the tally.")
('Van', "You probably didn't even need me here, let's<br/>be honest.")
('Van', "You've come a long way from the Kitty I first met.<br/>Good work today, Renne.")
('Renne', 'Heehee. Likewise.')
('System', 'Having completed their objective, Van accompanied<br/>Renne back to the surface for his promised gelato.')
('System', "The two took a short break together, Van enjoying<br/>his reward alongside a black tea of Renne's<br/>recommendation before parting ways.")
('Van', "Okay. If you're ready, then let's get to it.")
('Van', 'Just to make sure, you know what shards are?')
('Agnès', "Yes, I do. They're a field deployed by Xiphas.")
('Agnès', "I've used them before, but only in mock battles, and<br/>even then it was just for defensive purposes.")
('Van', "That's a fine start.")
('Van', 'Shards can be used for more than just that. They can<br/>be linked and used offensively, among other things.')
('Van', 'You gotta deploy them to do any of that, of course.')
('Van', "When you do, stay on your toes, 'cause it's<br/>fightin' time.")
('Van', 'Gonna ask again: You ready?')
('Agnès', "As I'll ever be!")
('Van', "Let's do this.")
('Van', 'Deploying shards!')
('Van', "That'll do.")
('Van', 'You handled yourself pretty well for your first fight.')
('Agnès', 'You flatter me, but I only did so well because you<br/>were covering me.')
('Agnès', "Hope you don't mind me asking, but I noticed you<br/>use a rather odd support AI—er, holo I think is the<br/>correct term.")
('Van', "Yeah. You're using Aim. That's a pretty generic one.")
('Van', "I'm using a custom, personalized holo.")
('Van', "It's pretty special, I'd say.")
('Van', "Her model is MK-ESV004. Name's Mare.")
('Van', 'I got an...acquaintance to send me a test version.')
('Van', "Her performance is way better than the<br/>generic models. It's the only reason I put up with her<br/>big mouth.")
('Agnès', "Haha. I think she's just fine, actually.")
('Agnès', 'The Xipha in general are really convenient to have.')
('Van', 'Yup. The sixth generation battle orbments made a<br/>real improvement over the last gen.')
('Van', 'The AI and shards are real lifesavers.')
('Van', "I'll teach you more about shards along the way.")
('Van', "Right now, let's keep movin'.")
('Agnès', "Yes, let's.")
('System', 'Information on orbments has been added to the Help<br/>section in the notebook.')
('Agnès', 'Those are the same types of monsters we<br/>saw earlier.')
('Van', "We won't even need to deploy our shards to clean up<br/>small fry like this.")
('Van', "Let's move in and clobber 'em.")
('Agnès', 'Right!')
('Agnès', 'Phew, we got through that safely.')
('Van', 'You did well in there, even without shards.')
('Van', "And you're pretty handy with that orbal staff.")
('Agnès', 'Ah, thank you.')
('Agnès', "I like being able to put a bit of distance between me<br/>and other enemies. It helps me remain calm when I'm<br/>dispatching them.")
('Van', 'Sounds like a solid strat.')
('Van', "I'll cover the front, so you can focus on support from<br/>the back.")
('Agnès', 'Will do!')
('Agnès', "By the way, Van. I've never seen a weapon like<br/>that before.")
('Agnès', "It's shaped like a sword, but it doesn't actually have an<br/>edge, does it?")
('Van', "It's a stun caliber.")
('Van', "Just like Mare, it's a more unique weapon I got<br/>through my connections.")
('Van', "And it does have an edge, actually. Using it takes a<br/>little trick. But that's not what I wanna focus on<br/>right now.")
('Van', "Every battle's kinda like a puzzle of their own.<br/>You need to weigh whether to end it without<br/>deploying shards, or if you're gonna go all in.")
('Van', "You need to figure out how to take them each at a<br/>time, and the answer's not always gonna be the same.")
('Van', 'Keep that in mind as we go along, yeah?')
('Agnès', "Yes, I'll try.")
('Van', 'Oh, great. Dromes. I hate those things.')
('Agnès', 'Most weapons will more or less bounce off their<br/>jelly-like bodies.')
('Agnès', "But that won't be a problem for my orbal staff!")
('Van', "Smart girl. That's a good idea.")
('Van', 'As a rule of thumb, enemies resistant to physical<br/>attacks are usually pretty weak to orbal arts.')
('Van', 'You probably already know this, but your orbal staff<br/>basically works just like orbal arts, sans the cast time.')
('Van', "I'll be usin' orbal arts for these guys, but you can pick<br/>between them and your staff. Whatever's more<br/>convenient for you.")
('Agnès', 'All right!')
('Van', "And that's all she wrote.")
('Agnès', 'Good job, Van.')
('Van', "(She's holdin' up a lot better than I thought.<br/>Half expected her to give up by now, or at least<br/>wanna take a break.)")
('Agnès', 'Is something the matter?')
('Van', "Nah, don't mind me.")
('Van', "Your orbal staff's pretty convenient when dealing<br/>with these guys.")
('Van', "That and your orbal arts are a pretty neat asset.<br/>It's nice havin' you watch my six.")
('Van', 'Just make sure you stay behind me. Leave the front<br/>lines to me.')
('Agnès', 'Van...')
('Agnès', 'I-I will! Thank you!')
