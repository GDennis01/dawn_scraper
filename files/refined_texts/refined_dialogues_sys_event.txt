('Van', 'Hello.')
('Fie', 'Hi.')
('Van', "(Okay, we've wrapped up our other work here.<br/>Suppose it's time we go handle the CID's job.)")
('System', 'If you choose to proceed, the main story will advance.')
('System', 'When this happens, you will no longer be able to<br/>move freely around town.')
('Van', "Oh, sounds like I've got mail.")
('Agnès', "Who's it from?")
('Feri', 'Who from?')
('Aaron', 'Oho. You got a booty call?')
('Van', 'No. Shut up.')
('Van', "It's from the CID. They've got another job for us.")
('Van', 'Typical monster extermination gig, looks like.')
('Van', "We'll be heading to Dirke Memorial Park.")
('Agnès', "Oh, really? I believe that's on the outskirts of the city.")
('Feri', "Ooh, I've never been to a memorial park before.")
('Aaron', "Never been to that place before. I'm guessing it's<br/>named after Sheena Dirke.")
('Van', "Would've been nice if they picked some place closer,<br/>but oh, well.")
('Van', "It's on the outskirts of the city, so we'll have to drive a<br/>ways to get there. Wish they picked some<br/>place closer.")
('Van', "(...Hold up. What's with all the extra line breaks?)")
('Van', '(Wait...)')
('System', 'P.S. Make sure you treasure all of your memories.')
('Van', '...')
('Van', "*sigh* That guy's a pain in the neck sometimes.")
('Agnès', '...? So, what should we do?')
('Feri', '...? Umm... So, what are we gonna do?')
('Aaron', "...? So, what's the plan, chief?")
('Van', "...Well, the pay's decent enough, I guess.")
('Van', "I think snatching it out of the guild's grubby paws is<br/>the play here.")
('Van', "We're gonna need to take the car, though, so let's get<br/>back to the garage once we're done with<br/>everything else.")
('Van', "...Hmm?<br/>(Don't recognize this number.)")
('Proprietress Hala', "Hello there. I take it I'm speaking with<br/>Feri's employer?")
('Proprietress Hala', "I'm the owner of the inn you all are staying at.<br/>Do you have a moment to talk?")
('Van', "Oh, sure. What's up?")
('Proprietress Hala', "There's a man who dropped by earlier and asked to<br/>pass along a message.")
('Proprietress Hala', 'He has a job for you, and he wishes to meet in person<br/>to discuss the nature of the request.')
('Van', "Got'cha. Well, I can't make any firm commitments,<br/>but I'm down to hear him out. Where's he at?")
('Proprietress Hala', "You will find him at the public bath in the<br/>Cultural District. He said this isn't an urgent matter,<br/>so you can take your time if you have other work.")
('Proprietress Hala', "That's all he had to say. Thank you.")
('Feri', 'Huh. Wonder what he wants.')
('Agnès', "Perhaps there's a problem with the baths?")
('Van', "Maybe, yeah. It'd explain why they were<br/>closed earlier.")
('Van', 'Maybe. Hard to know for sure till we head over there<br/>and see what the deal is.')
('Van', "If you're right, though, we should help him out.<br/>It's scorching hot, so now's a perfect time for a<br/>good soak.")
('Aaron', "Normally, I wouldn't be on board with enabling your<br/>weird sauna obsession, but I'll allow it this time.")
('Feri', "Me, too. I'll do anything to help beat this heat!")
('Agnès', "Then let's head over there as soon as we're ready.")
('Van', '(Did he find something already? That was fast.)')
('Dingo', 'Where are you right now, Van?')
('Van', "Oh, I'm over by—")
('Van', "...Huh? What's up? You sound kinda serious.")
('Dingo', 'I have an update for you.')
('Dingo', 'You remember those troublemaking tourists with<br/>the bodyguards?')
('Dingo', "Well, they're at it again.")
('Feri', 'Are you for real...? When are they gonna learn<br/>their lesson?')
('Van', "*sigh* What've they done this time?")
('Dingo', "Let me read out the witness' testimony.")
('Dingo', "'They went up to a local dancer girl and forced<br/>her into their car...'")
('Dingo', "'...then a girl in a beret tried to stop them—and they<br/>pushed her in, too.'")
('Van', '...!')
('Agnès', 'Th-That sounds like...')
('Risette', '...Have the police or the guild taken action?')
('Dingo', "They have not, unfortunately. It sounds like they<br/>don't have the manpower to spare at the moment.")
('Van', "(Okay, we've finished makin' our rounds.<br/>Nothing out of the ordinary so far.)")
('Van', "(Not much else to do now 'cept chill out and wait for<br/>the parade to start.)")
('System', "Choosing 'Wait for the Parade' from the Travel<br/>menu will cause the main story to advance.")
('Agnès', "Your Xipha's ringing, Van.")
('Van', "So it is.<br/>(I swear I've seen this number before...)")
('Zin the Immovable', "'Sup, Arkride? I heard you had a bad time<br/>in Tharbad.")
('Van', 'Ugh. Not you...')
('Zin the Immovable', "Aww, what do you mean, 'Not you'? You're gonna<br/>make me cry.")
('Van', "Can you blame me for bein' wary? You people're<br/>always hoverin' over me and judging how I choose to<br/>handle my work.")
('Van', "Plus I have a sinking feeling you're only callin' to<br/>bring trouble to my doorstep. Again.")
('Zin the Immovable', "Ahaha. Am I that easy to read? Yeah, this job's a<br/>toughie, for sure.")
('Zin the Immovable', "I'll cut to the chase. Would you mind coming with<br/>me to the 13th?")
('Van', '...!')
('Agnès', '...?')
('Risette', '(The 13th...)')
('Zin the Immovable', "Surely you don't need me to spell out what<br/>that means.")
('Zin the Immovable', "You strike me as the kinda guy who'd drop by there<br/>a lot.")
('Van', 'No comment.')
('Van', "I'm curious. What business do you have there?")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Oh, nothing major.')
('Zin the Immovable', "But it's not exactly a place I fit in, especially as of late.")
('Zin the Immovable', "So I figured I'd ask if you could tag along.<br/>C'mon, help a guy out, will ya?")
('Van', '...')
('Van', 'All right, you win. You owe me one after<br/>this, though.')
('Van', 'Wanna meet up in the C-3 area?')
('Zin the Immovable', "Sure thing. Oh, and don't feel like you need to rush if<br/>you've got other business to take care of. I can keep<br/>myself busy while I wait.")
('Agnès', 'Umm...')
('Feri', "So, what'd he want?")
('Aaron', "So that's the famous Zin the Immovable.")
('Aaron', 'The hell did he want?')
('Van', "Oh, nothing much. Don't worry about it.")
('Van', "(Guess I'll head over once I've wrapped up my<br/>other work.)")
('Risette', '(Hmm...)')
('System', "Choosing 'Call It a Day' from the Travel menu will<br/>cause the main story to advance.")
('Van', '(I agreed to meet up with the Immovable once my<br/>other work was done.)')
('Van', '(Should I head over there now?)')
('Van', "I think that's all there is to see in the Artisanal<br/>District. We should check out New Town next.")
('Risette', 'Since we cannot use the aerotram, we will have to<br/>either walk or drive there.')
('Van', "Let's take a walk. It'll help us get more acquainted<br/>with the city and its people.")
('Aaron', "You gotta be kidding me. Walking's a pain in the ass.")
('Agnès', 'Well, I, for one, think a stroll would be lovely.')
('Feri', "Me, too! Let's make our way to the bridge, then.")
('Agnès', '(Maybe now would be a good time to call Quatre and<br/>ask about our certification cards.)')
('System', 'Contacting Quatre will cause the main story<br/>to advance. As a result, all unfinished quests<br/>will disappear.')
('Quatre', "Yes, this is Salision speaking. Ah, it's you, Agnès.")
('Agnès', "Oh, good! I was worried I wouldn't be able to<br/>get through.")
('Agnès', "...? It sounds like there's a little bit of interference<br/>with the connection, though.")
('Quatre', 'Right. I apologize for that—I happen to be in the<br/>middle of something at the moment.')
('Quatre', "Could you wait for me at a place called<br/>Giscard Workshop? It's in the Artisanal District.<br/>I will be there shor—")
('Agnès', '...Hello?')
('Quatre', "...That's not good!")
('Quatre', 'FI...a sear...')
('Agnès', 'Hello? Hello?!')
('Agnès', 'What just happened...?')
('Feri', "It sounded like something collapsed, and I could've<br/>sworn I heard a faint roar after that...")
('Aaron', 'Sounds like trouble to me.')
('Risette', "We were just at Giscard's workshop a short<br/>while ago.")
('Van', "Let's get on back there and see what the deal is!")
('System', 'Drive to Auge Canyon?')
('Agnès', 'Phew. That was a lot to take in.')
('Quatre', "I'm still trying to process it all, myself. I can hardly<br/>believe Professor Callaghan is attempting to develop<br/>nuclear weapons...")
('Quatre', "His chances of succeeding are slim to none, but we<br/>can't discount the possibility that he'll make another<br/>dangerous invention along the way.")
('Feri', "And we can't let something like that fall into<br/>Almata's hands.")
('Van', "We'll need some clues if we want to stop<br/>them, though. And that outdoor experiment complex<br/>in the canyon is the best lead we have.")
('Van', "If he's been frequenting that place, there's a decent<br/>chance he'll have left something<br/>incriminating behind.")
('Aaron', "Well, what're we standing around here for, then?<br/>Let's get our asses over there and get the jump<br/>on him.")
('Aaron', "We'll bag that son of a bitch in a jiff and leave the<br/>cops', guild's, and CID's jaws on the floor.")
('Risette', 'A solid course of action. We should make our way<br/>over there as soon as we are ready.')
('Agnès', "Sounds like a plan.<br/>(I should let my classmates know what's going on.)")
('Van', 'Oh, shoot. One sec.')
('Bermotti', "Hello, hello! I hope I didn't catch you at a bad time.")
('Van', "Nah, you're good. What's up, Bermotti?")
('Quatre', "It's the man from earlier.")
('Aaron', "It's the weird bartender dude.")
('Bermotti', "Oh, my. You better watch who you're calling 'weird,'<br/>darling, or you may find yourself in danger of being<br/>pecked on the cheek by moi!")
('Bermotti', "Aaanywho, I'm afraid this isn't a social call. I have a<br/>little job for you. Interested?")
('Bermotti', 'I have a little job for you. Interested?')
('Van', "Sure. Might take us a bit before we can tackle it, but<br/>you're free to run your request by us now if you want.")
('Bermotti', "Actually, this request comes from a regular of mine.<br/>He's in a spot of trouble, you see.")
('Bermotti', 'He hoped he could discuss it with you personally.<br/>Would you be a dear and make time to meet<br/>with him?')
('Van', "You want me to what now? C'mon, man. I'm on a<br/>tight schedule here.")
('Van', "But, ehh, what the hell. I do owe you one for your<br/>help in Tharbad, so I can at least hear him out.<br/>I'll swing by your place in a sec.")
('Bermotti', 'Ah. That, erm, may pose a problem. This is a matter<br/>that requires discretion, and my establishment is<br/>subject to the prying eyes of the public.')
('Bermotti', "They've already picked out a more secluded venue, as<br/>it so happens. Could I trouble you to drive<br/>there instead?")
('Bermotti', "They'll give you a call once you're on the road. In the<br/>meantime, let me send you the meeting location.")
('Van', 'Oh, this is...')
('Bermotti', 'Good luck, my love! Hugs and kisses! ❤')
('Quatre', "That man is, umm, certainly a character, isn't he?")
('Feri', "Yeah, but he's super nice! I like him a bunch!")
('Feri', "He gives me loads of free sweets when I stop by after<br/>Sunday School, so he's an awesome guy in my book.")
('Van', 'What?! No fair! He never gives ME free sweets!')
('Risette', "He is, indeed. And he's highly capable as well.")
('Risette', "He's just as adept with handling information as he is<br/>with cocktails.")
('Van', "Heh. Won't argue with you there.")
('Quatre', 'Could someone fill me in on who that was?')
('Feri', "His name's Bermotti. He's an information dealer<br/>from Remiferia, and he runs a café and bar down by<br/>the river.")
('Feri', "He's also super knowledgeable about medicine<br/>and stuff.")
('Risette', 'His name is Bermotti. He is an information dealer<br/>from Remiferia, and he owns a café and bar near<br/>the river.')
('Risette', 'He also has a vast array of pharmaceutical knowledge.')
('Agnès', "His name is Bermotti. He's an information dealer<br/>from Remiferia, and he owns a café and bar near<br/>the river.")
('Agnès', 'He also knows a great deal about medicine.')
('Quatre', 'Ah. He sounds like an interesting person. I ought to<br/>get better acquainted with him.')
('Agnès', 'So, where are we headed now?')
('Van', "We're gonna drive along the capital's third<br/>belt expressway.")
('Van', "They chose an interesting spot to meet up. I'm pretty<br/>damn curious to see who our mystery client is.")
('Aaron', 'Same.')
('Feri', 'Me, too.')
('Quatre', "They've certainly gone to great lengths to conceal<br/>where they are and what they're doing.")
('Quatre', 'Well, anyway, I believe my training is nearly at<br/>an end.')
('Quatre', "As soon as we're ready, let's make our way back to the<br/>office and pick up the car.")
('Van', 'Sounds good to me—')
('Van', 'Wait, who made you the boss?! ...Ugh. Kids<br/>these days.')
('Aaron', 'Spoken like a true old fart.')
('Van', 'Wait, who made you the boss?! ...Ugh. Kids<br/>these days.')
('Risette', 'Perhaps we should stop and resupply on our way to<br/>the office. Then we can head off.')
('Agnès', 'Well, we should probably get the other two up to<br/>speed once we get back.')
('System', 'Expressway Route 3 was added to the Travel menu.')
('System', 'Choosing this will cause the main story to advance.')
('Van', "(Sounds like a fun drive, but once we head out, we're<br/>not gonna be back for a good long while.)")
('Van', '(There anything else I gotta do before we call it?)')
('Van', "Huh?<br/>(Looks like it's from one of my assistants.)")
('Agnès', 'Hi, Van. Do you have a moment?')
('Van', 'Yeah, of course. Everything all right?')
('Agnès', "Yes, I'm fine. Something's come up, though.")
('Agnès', 'I found a 4SPG on the bulletin board in front of<br/>the station.')
('Van', "Wait, what?! How long you think it's been up there?")
('Agnès', 'Not long. It had to have been put up very recently.')
('Agnès', "What should we do? We aren't here to work, so we<br/>could ignore it.")
('Van', "Nah, I say we look into it. I'll be right there.<br/>(I'll have to let the others know, too.)")
('Quatre', 'Hey, Van. Do you have a moment?')
('Van', "Yeah, of course. Everything all right? You didn't get<br/>lost or something, did you?")
('Quatre', 'No, of course not. I just found something that might<br/>interest you.')
('Quatre', "There's a 4SPG on the bulletin board that's in front<br/>of the station.")
('Van', "What? For real?! How long you think it's been<br/>up there?")
('Quatre', 'Not for long. In fact, I suspect it was put up<br/>very recently.')
('Quatre', 'What should we do? Should we just ignore it?')
('Van', "Nah, I say we look into it. I'll be right there.<br/>(I'll have to let the others know, too.)")
('Risette', 'Hello, Mr. Arkride. Do you have a moment?')
('Van', 'Yeah, of course. Everything all right?')
('Risette', "Yes, I'm fine. Though I did find something rather<br/>peculiar, and I thought it best to report.")
('Risette', 'There is a 4SPG on the bulletin board in front of<br/>the station.')
('Van', "Wait, what?! How long you think it's been up there?")
('Risette', 'I suspect it was put up sometime today.')
('Risette', "Shall we ignore it? We aren't here to work.")
('Van', "Nah, I say we look into it. I'll be right there.<br/>(I'll have to let the others know, too.)")
('Van', "I think that's about all the information we're gonna<br/>get for now.")
('Agnès', 'Well, at least we managed to learn a lot in a<br/>short time.')
('Judith', "Yeah, but it's all pretty darn grim...")
('Van', "Oh, I got a message from René. Maybe he's got some<br/>useful int—")
('Van', "...Never mind. It's just a monster<br/>extermination request.")
('Agnès', 'Wait, really? Where?')
('Agnès', "Ah, so it's in an abandoned subway line underneath<br/>the Auber District...")
('Judith', "Isn't that the place where the cathedral and that<br/>famous academy are?")
('Judith', "...Wait, don't you go to that school?")
('Agnès', 'I do, yes. Anyway, this hardly seems to be an<br/>appropriate time to be sending out such<br/>ordinary requests.')
('Judith', "You're telling me.")
('Van', "Well, whatever. Work's work.")
('Van', "As soon as we're done here, let's head on over to the<br/>Auber District.")
('System', "To advance the main story, select 'Auber District' or<br/>make your way to the subway entrance.")
('Van', "I think that's about all the information we're gonna<br/>get for now.")
('Agnès', 'Well, at least we managed to learn a lot in a<br/>short time.')
('Judith', "Yeah, but it's all pretty darn grim...")
('Van', "Oh, I got a message from René. Maybe he's got some<br/>useful int—")
('Van', "...Never mind. It's just a monster<br/>extermination request.")
('Agnès', 'Wait, really? Where?')

('Judith', "Isn't that the place where the cathedral and that<br/>famous academy are?")
('Judith', "...Wait, don't you go to that school?")
('Agnès', 'I do, yes. Anyway, this hardly seems to be an<br/>appropriate time to be sending out such<br/>ordinary requests.')
('Judith', "You're telling me.")
('Van', "Well, whatever. Work's work.")
('Van', "As soon as we're done here, let's head on over to the<br/>Auber District.")
('System', "To advance the main story, select 'Auber District' or<br/>make your way to the subway entrance.")
('Van', "(We've gathered all the information there is to gather.<br/>Should we go take on those monsters now?)")
('System', 'Visiting the Auber District will cause the main story<br/>to advance.')
('System', 'As a result, all unfinished quests and unseen<br/>sub-events will disappear.')
('Cao', 'Oh, my. What a fortuitous coincidence.')
('Aaron', "Of all the people we could've run into, it just HAD to<br/>be them.")
('Van', "Ugh. We're really down on our luck today, huh?")
('Van', "Well, nothing we can do about it now. We'll just have<br/>to beat you till you're black and blue.")
('Agnès', 'Do we HAVE to jump straight to violence?<br/>We could try to talk it out for once.')
('Cao', 'The young lady is quite right. Why must we resort to<br/>such brutality from the outset?')
('Cao', 'Did we not come to an amicable agreement just the<br/>other day?')
('Van', "That was just to exchange information that'd help us<br/>keep Almata in check.")
('Van', "But in situations like these, negotiations are off<br/>the table. You're a shady bastard who'll screw us over<br/>in a heartbeat.")
('Aaron', "He's got you there, pal.")
('Cao', 'You wound me.')
('Cao', 'I would never do such a thing, especially when you<br/>are the one with the upper hand in numbers.')
('Cao', 'You even recruited some powerful lackeys. I believe<br/>you have a good deal of leverage in this arrangement.')
('Zin the Immovable', "Yeah, well, these 'lackeys' don't want to negotiate<br/>with you, either.")
('Fie', "Same. I don't distrust Rixia, but you're a whole other<br/>can of worms.")
('Elaine', "I can't trust anyone that's close to Gien.")
('Cao', 'Oh, my. What did I do to deserve these<br/>unflattering accusations?')
('Rixia', 'Do you even have to ask?')
('Shizuna', "You're from the East like us, right?")
('Kurogane', "They are, but Heiyue's roots differ from ours.<br/>They're the descendants of the largest of the nine<br/>peoples of the Navagraha.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', '...Oh, are you calling us lackeys? How bold.')
('Walter the Direwolf', "I don't appreciate the condescension, but I still<br/>respect ya for mastering the Gekka style.")
('Cao', 'We are clearly at a disadvantage here, so why do you<br/>insist that we must fight?')
('Cao', 'You have the two of us in the palm of your hand.')
('Van', "Yeah, I'm not buying that for a second.")
('Van', "For one, both you and Yin are easily capable of<br/>kickin' all our butts alone.")
('Van', "And honestly, I'm not even sure if you ARE<br/>alone here. I think you've got some men in this<br/>very room.")
('Agnès', '...!')
('Feri', 'What? Where?')
('Aaron', "It's definitely possible that he's got some xiongshou<br/>that're out of sight.")
('Risette', 'That would significantly shift the balance of power in<br/>this exchange.')
('Bergard', 'Right. They could ambush us at any time while our<br/>attention is on the two of them.')
('Quatre', "(FIO's scan isn't picking up anything, but that doesn't<br/>necessarily mean they aren't here...)")
('Rixia', '...')
('Cao', 'My, my. You seem to have gotten some rather strange<br/>ideas into your heads.')
('Cao', 'Still, if you do not plan to make the first move, then<br/>allow us to do the honors—')
('Judith', 'Just a second.')
('Cao', "Ah. It's a pleasure to finally make your acquaintance,<br/>Judith Lanster.")
('Cao', "I'm something of a fan, myself. Golden Blood is<br/>undisputedly my movie of the year.")
('Judith', 'Uh, thanks. Anyway...')
('Judith', "It's good to see you again. Been a while, hasn't it?")
('Rixia', "That it has. You've been doing quite well for yourself<br/>while I've been away.")
('Van', 'Wait, hold the phone. You two know each other?')
('Aaron', 'For real? You, like, friends or something?')
('Judith', "Yeah. Although, we're not just friends. We're rivals.")
('Judith', "And we've been that way since the day we met.")
('Judith', 'That was...eight years ago now? We had only just<br/>taken up the mantle from our predecessors at<br/>that point.')
('Judith', 'Sometimes our jobs put us in conflict with one<br/>another, but we got to team up every now and then.')
('Judith', 'We may have been rivals, but we were comrades, too.')
('Feri', '...')
('Agnès', "I never would've guessed.")
('Rixia', 'The memories are coming back to me. We spent<br/>many hours discussing the weight of what we<br/>had inherited.')
('Rixia', 'Before I knew it, though, you had found your place<br/>amongst the stars. You were thriving in a world<br/>unbeknownst to me.')
('Rixia', "Oh, but don't misunderstand. I was truly happy for<br/>you, but I was a little sad as well. I felt left behind.")
('Judith', 'So you left for Crossbell and followed that other<br/>path...because of me?!')
('Rixia', 'Not at all. The path I chose was entirely my own.')
('Rixia', "Having said that, it's possible I was subconsciously<br/>influenced by you on some level.")
('Rixia', "You're like the brightest star in the sky. I'm just a<br/>moon—I can't shine like you...or her.")
('Rixia', 'But I came to know the joy of the stage—as well as<br/>being at the center of it. The life of theater has<br/>captivated me ever since...')
('Rixia', '...just like how the life of cinema has done the same<br/>for you.')
('Judith', '...')
('Judith', "Y'know, I'm almost jealous. When I was struggling to<br/>find my way, you lent me an ear and your wisdom.")
('Judith', 'You never needed my help, though. You found the<br/>path you wanted to follow all on your own.')
('Rixia', "I did. And now I'm going to show you everything I've<br/>learned during the time we've been apart.")
('Judith', "I'm curious to see which of us has grown more these<br/>past four years.")
('Rixia', "As am I. Let's do this!")
('Aaron', 'Heh.')
('Aaron', "I think I'll add my own fuel to the fire.")
('Aaron', "Cao! I've got a score to settle, and I'm not gonna be<br/>satisfied until I beat the everloving shit outta you.")
('Cao', 'Very well. I hold your potential in high regard,<br/>Little Conqueror.')
('Cao', "Let's see if you managed to break out of your shell.<br/>Show me that my confidence in you is not misplaced!")
('Aaron', "I'll do more than that, you four-eyed<br/>bastard!")
('Van', "Well, I'm glad that he's fired up, at least.")
('Elaine', "We're up against both Yin and the White<br/>Orchid Dragon. Don't let your guard down!")
('Kurogane', 'I am interested to see just what the famous White<br/>Orchid Dragon can do.')
('Walter the Direwolf', 'I had a pretty damn good time fighting<br/>your predecessor.')
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Hopefully you can measure up!')
('Cao', 'Interesting. Very interesting.')
('Cao', 'The time you have spent under Van has clearly done<br/>wonders in drawing out your latent potential.')
('Aaron', "*pant* I've been seeing a hell of a lot of combat, that's<br/>for sure.")
('Aaron', "You barely broke a sweat through that whole<br/>thing, though. Looks like I've got a ways to go.")
('Judith', 'Whew... You sure are something.')
('Judith', "You were waaay outnumbered, but you still put up<br/>one heck of a fight. You're in a class of your own.")
('Rixia', "Haha. I don't think that's true at all.")
('Rixia', 'I came at you with everything I had, and that was still<br/>the best I could do.')
('Rixia', "I hope my performance didn't leave you disappointed.")
('Judith', 'Oh, you have GOT to be kidding me.')
('Rixia', '...')
('Judith', "If I had to rate it on a scale of one to ten, I'd give you<br/>an eleven. You were that amazing.")
('Judith', 'Argh. I am SO jealous of that woman! She has you all<br/>to herself!')
('Judith', "And thanks to her, you've grown to be a shining star.<br/>She must be really special.")
('Rixia', "Haha. That's one quality the two of you share.<br/>You have more in common with her than you<br/>might realize.")
('Agnès', 'That was certainly enlightening.')
('Quatre', 'Hmm... Crossbell... Performances... One woman<br/>immediately springs to mind when I think of<br/>those things together.')
('Risette', "Well, we shouldn't eavesdrop any more. It's rude to<br/>pry into someone else's personal life.")
('Feri', "True. Still, I'm glad this whole thing had a<br/>happy ending.")
('Zin the Immovable', "I'm just amazed at how well they held up against the<br/>eleven of us.")
('Shizuna', 'It was an honor to see you in action, Yin. You really<br/>live up to your legend.')
('Shizuna', 'Same goes for you, Mister Future Heiyue Leader.')
('Walter the Direwolf', "You're already on par with your pops. I'm impressed.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "Me, too. You're unrivaled in both strength<br/>AND looks. I think I may be falling for you!")
('Van', 'All right. We good to call this match decided?')
('Cao', 'Yes. We admit defeat. I had hoped that we could<br/>catch you unawares with my trump card, but alas.')
('Cao', 'We have two keycards in our possession, and they are<br/>now yours.')
('Van', 'So you guys drew first blood in this game, huh?<br/>Figures.')
('System', 'Received two keycards.')
('Cao', 'We have three keycards in our possession, and they<br/>are now yours.')
('System', 'Received three keycards.')
('System', 'Team Heiyue has been eliminated.')
('Aaron', "You sure that was a good idea? Gien's gonna get<br/>pretty pissy with you.")
('Cao', 'Oh, I very much doubt that. Whether we won or lost<br/>was never of any consequence.')
('Cao', "We came here with the express purpose of witnessing<br/>Almata's end—and we can accomplish that while off<br/>the game board.")
('Quatre', 'Whoa! They really were here all along!')
('Bergard', 'You were playing your cards close to the chest, I see.')
('Cao', 'We fully intend to abide by the rules, so we will not<br/>interfere with the game or its players any further.')
('Cao', 'However, we can still offer aid from the sidelines.<br/>Should you defeat any of the bosses, we would be all<br/>too happy to take them into our care.')
('Cao', 'Consider giving them over to us instead of those<br/>brutes from the guild.')
('Elaine', '...')
('Fie', '...Can I punch him? I REALLY want to punch him.')
('Cao', "Regardless, I will be praying for your team's success.<br/>Yin and I will take our leave.")
('Rixia', "I'll see you around, Judith.")
('Judith', 'See ya.')
('Van', "*sigh* I hate dealing with that guy. Even when you<br/>have a leg up on him, it always feels like he's ten steps<br/>ahead anyway.")
('Agnès', "It does feel like he accounted for the possibility of<br/>him losing that battle. He's quite the schemer.")
('Aaron', "We'll just have to cook up some schemes of our own<br/>and pay him back tenfold!")
('Shizuna', "What's up, guys? Oh, and if it isn't the famous<br/>Roaring Lion himself. Nice to see you again.")
('Shizuna', "It's been, what, three-ish weeks since we met?<br/>And even less for the rest of the gang.")
('Van', 'Hang on. You met my master?')
('Bergard', "'Met' isn't the word I'd use. We merely exchanged<br/>glances from a distance.")
('Bergard', 'I regret that I was unable to greet you directly, Divine<br/>Blade of Silver.')
('Shizuna', 'Heh. Likewise.')
('Shizuna', 'Okay! You guys ready to go at it?')
('Van', 'What, like, right now?')
('Shizuna', "Of course! I was super bummed that we couldn't<br/>finish our battle the other day. I've been itching for a<br/>rematch with you guys ever since.")
('Shizuna', "I see you've brought some guests with you, too.<br/>And some very tough ones, at that.")
('Fie', 'The Divine Blade of Silver.')
('Fie', "I've heard stories about you. You trained under the<br/>same master as Rean—and had a brief confrontation<br/>with him not too long ago.")
('Shizuna', "Heehee. So he's been telling all his little friends<br/>about me? How flattering.")
('Shizuna', "Oh, and I've heard about you, too. Did you know I<br/>met your boss once? I am VERY interested to see just<br/>what his little squirt is made of!")
('Fie', "Call me 'little squirt' one more time and I will<br/>end you.")
('Cao', "Well, now. I certainly didn't expect to find myself<br/>face to face with the famous Divine Blade of Silver.")
('Rixia', "So you're the unofficial student of the master who<br/>taught Arios and Rean.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Well, isn't this a thrillin' surprise.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "I wasn't expecting to find such a fearsome<br/>opponent here. Her strength may very well<br/>exceed ours.")
('Van', "If you wanna pick a fight with us, then so be it.<br/>We'll give you a hell of a beatdown.")
('Kurogane', 'Allow me to fight by your side, Princess.')
('Shizuna', "I'd like to tell you, 'Keep your hands off them and<br/>leave this to me...'")
('Shizuna', "...but that'd be selfish. It's not every day that we run<br/>into foes who are this exciting, so I'll be a good girl<br/>and share.")
('Shizuna', 'Show them the might of the Ikaruga.')
('Kurogane', 'As you wish.')
('Kurogane', 'I, Kurogane of the Rougetsu school, shall face you<br/>in battle!')
('Aaron', "We're going up against the masked dude, too?<br/>What a pain.")
('Risette', 'Both of them are the same as an S-level threat—<br/>perhaps even greater! Be careful, everyone!')
('Shizuna', "Now, I'm not very easy to impress, so you better blow<br/>me away—or I'll blow you off the face of the earth!")
('Feri', 'That was rough...')
('Quatre', 'But I think we got them, at least?')
('Agnès', "Yeah... It doesn't look like they have any<br/>reinforcements, so I think we're in the clear.")
('Fie', "Good. I got some long overdue payback for Rean, so<br/>I'm pretty happy.")
('Bergard', '...Hmm? Wait.')
('Shizuna', 'Heh... Heheheh...')
('Shizuna', 'That...was awesome. You and your friends really are<br/>quite something.')
('Shizuna', "All right. Warmup time's over.")
('Shizuna', 'No more playing around. Ready to die?')
('Judith', "I-It's that same battle aura again!")
('Risette', "We're no match for her in that state.")
('Van', "Damn it. Maybe we shouldn't have went so hard in<br/>that fight!")
('Zin the Immovable', 'So this is the Divine Blade of Silver at her best, huh?')
('Cao', 'I did not realize she possessed so much power.')
('Walter the Direwolf', "Haha! She isn't a Divine Blade for nothing.")
('Kurogane', 'If I may be so bold, Princess, I would ask that you<br/>exercise self-restraint.')
('Shizuna', 'Oh? And just why should I do that?')
('Kurogane', 'If you continue along this path, we will run the risk of<br/>interfering with our primary contract.')
('Kurogane', 'So please, I again ask that you—')
('Shizuna', "Mmm. Nah, not happening. It's been AGES since I<br/>last felt this excited.")
('Shizuna', "And I can't pass up this opportunity to finally see<br/>what lies beyond zero's frontier. It's almost<br/>within sight!")
('Shizuna', "Sorry, but I think I'm gonna be a little selfish today.<br/>This one's mine, so back off.")
('Kurogane', 'But—')
('Shizuna', 'Back. Off.')
('Kurogane', '...As you wish.')
('Kurogane', 'I regret to inform you that there is no stopping the<br/>princess when she gets like this.')
('Kurogane', 'Some of you will die. I extend my apologies<br/>and condolences.')
('Quatre', 'Th-Thanks... I think?')
('Feri', 'Should we fall back?!')
('Van', "No. She'd just chase after us, and I don't like our<br/>chances of outrunning her.")
('Van', "We'll just have to stand our ground and fight back!")
('Agnès', 'Right! We can do this!')
('Shizuna', "Can you? Guess we'll find out.")
('Van', "(I'm not gonna make it!)")
('Van', 'Wha...?!')
('Shizuna', 'Now where...?')
('Shizuna', 'Aha. Found you.')
(40454, 'Gah!')
(40455, 'Ugh!')
('Aaron', 'The xiongshou?!')
('Van', "What're they doing here?!")
('Shizuna', "Can't hide from me.")
('Shizuna', 'Haaah!')
(40453, 'Agh...?!')
('Aaron', "Are they Gien's?! No, their masks are different!")
('Cao', 'Indeed. As you should know, not everyone in Heiyue<br/>is on the same page.')
('Cao', 'Those xiongshou serve one of the other elders.')
('Cao', 'Naturally, that means we are not the only team from<br/>Heiyue participating in this game.')
('Rixia', 'As we suspected.')
('Aaron', 'These xiongshou must be serving one of the<br/>other elders!')
('Shizuna', 'Ugh. Well, that was lame. Totally killed my vibe.')
('Shizuna', 'You just had to go and spoil my fun.')
(40453, '...!')
(40454, 'I fear we underestimated her true capabilities.')
(40455, "You may be right. Let's retreat for now. We have to<br/>protect our key—")
('Shizuna', "Key? Oh, you were about to say 'keycards,'<br/>weren't you?")
(40455, 'Gah!')
('Shizuna', "I don't care about those things one bit.")
('Shizuna', "Okay, here's the deal. I'm going to give you guys two<br/>choices:")
('Shizuna', 'Flee or die.')
(40451, '...!')
(40452, 'Retreat!')
('Van', 'Whew...')
('Agnès', "S-So this is what it's like to see a Divine Blade<br/>in action.")
('Risette', "I don't believe any of them are quite like her.")
('Shizuna', 'Okay, now that the trash has been dealt with, shall we<br/>pick up where we left off?')
('Shizuna', '...*sigh*')
('Shizuna', 'Never mind. Not feeling it anymore.')
('Shizuna', "Man. Those worthless goons were such killjoys,<br/>weren't they? Can't believe I let them break my focus.")
('Shizuna', 'You can have these.')
('System', 'Received three keycards.')
('System', 'Received four keycards.')
('Van', 'Wait, what?')
('Shizuna', "Let's just call this our loss, 'kay?")
('Shizuna', "I lost the will to keep going, and that's all she wrote.")
('Van', 'Team Ikaruga has been eliminated.')
('Van', 'You sure about this?')
('Shizuna', "Uh-huh! Taking part in this game wasn't even a part<br/>of our contract.")
('Shizuna', 'I was just here to have a bit of fun, and I got my fill<br/>of it!')
('Kurogane', 'And now that she has, we shall return to the city and<br/>fulfill our contractual duties.')
('Kurogane', 'You may do as you please.')
('Van', "All right. As long as you're cool with the result.")
('Shizuna', "I AM still disappointed that our fight ended before<br/>you could pull out that other form of yours. I'd looove<br/>to see it sometime.")
('Shizuna', "Anyway, we're off. If you see us in the city, give us<br/>a holler! Don't be a stranger, okay?")
('Kurogane', 'If you will excuse us.')
('Quatre', 'M-My legs are still shaking...')
('Aaron', 'Gah. That whole thing pissed me off. She got to flex<br/>AND save our asses from the xiongshou.')
('Zin the Immovable', "That girl is somethin' else. She hides a great deal of<br/>power behind that innocent smile.")
('Cao', 'Those men may not be the elites of the Lu family, but<br/>they are well trained and powerful in their own right.')
('Cao', 'Yet she defeated each of them with a single swing of<br/>her sword. How frightening.')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'If the fight had been allowed to go on, I would have<br/>witnessed the heights of swordsmanship. A pity.')
('Van', "In any case, we nabbed ourselves some keycards, and<br/>a dangerous team's out of the running. I'd call that a<br/>huge win.")
('Van', "But we can't rest on our laurels, so let's get movin'.")
('Feri', 'Right!')
('Van', 'Ah, hell.')
('Zin the Immovable', '...')
('Harwood', "Aww. Why the dirty look? Do you glare at all of your<br/>clients like that? It's a wonder you're still in business.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Damn, Arkride. You joined up with them and not us?<br/>I'm heartbroken.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "Aww, cheer up, Walter dear. Look, it's your old rival!<br/>Aren't you thrilled to see him again after all<br/>these years?")
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Actually, we ran into each other just the other day.')
('Agnès', '(It seems like they have some history.)')
('Van', '(Yeah. They both studied under the same master.)')
('Zin the Immovable', "I figured we'd cross paths in here sooner or later, but I<br/>didn't think it'd happen so soon.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Not sure whether to call this a stroke of luck or a<br/>bad break.')
('Walter the Direwolf', "Well, that nosy woman ain't here, so how about we<br/>finally have our no-holds-barred match?")
('Zin the Immovable', "Sorry, but that's up to my pal Arkride. He's the one<br/>calling the shots for me and Fie.")
('Zin the Immovable', "So if he says no, then that's that. I know you're the<br/>'my way or the highway' type, but that's not how<br/>I roll.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Always got an excuse to wuss out, don't ya?")
('Cao', 'Heh. I was quite touched that we were his<br/>first choice.')
('Shizuna', "I mean, you can't blame him too much. Kurogane and<br/>I ARE pretty awesome!")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "Anyway, I'm in the mood for a little murder spree.<br/>Would anyone care to offer themselves up for a<br/>quick butchering?")
('Judith', 'Who would say yes to that?!')
('Quatre', "Honestly, I would rather avoid a fight, if it's all the<br/>same to you.")
('Harwood', "That's a pity. Seems like you kids forgot what I told<br/>you back at your office.")
('Harwood', "Oh, and should you happen to run into us, I'd like<br/>you to come at me knives out—and ready to cut me<br/>into a million little pieces.")
('Harwood', "I'm very much into that sort of thing.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Oh, you guys had an agreement like that in place?<br/>Guess that means you're obligated to fight me.")
('Harwood', "No, no. We won't force them. If they aren't<br/>interested, then I'm all for respecting their wishes.")
('Harwood', "Besides, they charged us an arm and a leg for their<br/>services, so there's no sense in eliminating them now.")
('Van', "...You're really gonna let us go?")
('Harwood', 'Of course. Defeating you here would give me no<br/>pleasure, anyway.')
('Bergard', "You'll have to excuse me for finding that hard<br/>to believe.")
('Harwood', "I've no reason to lie. I'm simply the kind of man who<br/>saves the tastiest treat for last.")
('Harwood', "Let's just pretend we never saw each other and be on<br/>our merry way.")
('Harwood', 'Does that sound fair?')
('Agnès', 'Should we take them up on their offer?')
('Risette', 'I believe we should, if only to conserve our energy for<br/>the battles ahead.')
('Van', 'Fair point.')
('Harwood', "Good. Glad we're in agreement.")
('Harwood', "Let's go, you two. We're leaving.")
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Whatever you say.')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'Best of luck, everyone.')
('Van', "(Something's not right here...)")
('Van', '(Is this really the right call? Should I let them go?)')
('Van', "But I will share one little known fact: the Thousand<br/>Oathbreaker isn't his only title.")
('Van', "He's also known as the Savant Lawbreaker.")
('Van', '...Wait. I got a question for you.')
('Harwood', 'Ugh. Really, now?')
('Harwood', "Can't it wait till after we take out the other teams?")
('Van', "No, it can't. Tell me, Ellroy. Are you up<br/>to something?")
('Agnès', '...Huh?')
('Harwood', "Haha. Now that's a silly question.")
('Harwood', "Allow me to let you in on a little secret: I'm always up<br/>to something.")
('Van', 'Okay, let me rephrase.')
('Van', "What's your real reason for avoiding a fight?")
('Harwood', 'Oh? Did Renne give you a word of warning about<br/>me, perhaps?')
('Harwood', 'And here I was thinking she took a liking to me.<br/>Unlike the professor, I was reasonably nice to her<br/>when she was a child.')
('Van', "If you thought you could fool Renne with fake smiles<br/>and honeyed words, then you clearly didn't know her.")
('Van', "And you can't fool me, either. You're setting up some<br/>kinda trap in this place, aren't you?")
('Harwood', '...')
('Feri', 'Wait, really?')
('Quatre', 'The only abnormality FIO picked up was the<br/>presence of the higher elements.')
('Van', "I'm not exactly sure what stunt you're pullin' here...")
('Van', "...but I'm on to you. We know that most groups<br/>that've opposed you got silenced—permanently.")
('Van', "Their cases were labeled as 'accidents,' 'resulting from<br/>internal conflict,' and other things of that nature.")
('Van', "The authorities wrote off every death in those cases as<br/>'cause unknown' or coincidental.")
('Van', "Though I'm thinkin' you're using some kind of<br/>unknown bacteria or virus—or an untraceable poison.")
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Heh.')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'Oh, my.')
('Harwood', '...')
('Judith', "He's using WHAT?!")
('Quatre', 'So he possesses biological and chemical weapons...')
('Risette', 'Those are illegal under international law.')
('Harwood', "Heheh. That nose of yours really is something,<br/>isn't it?")
('Harwood', 'I do indeed use both, but I prefer the<br/>chemical variety. Biological weapons are harder<br/>to handle.')
('Feri', '...')
('Agnès', '...')
('Walter the Direwolf', "Now you know why I said there isn't a bigger monster<br/>in all of Zemuria than him.")
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Nice detective work, Arkride. Looks like you might<br/>walk outta this alive after all.')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "Now you won't have to die in the most painful<br/>way imaginable. Death by asphyxiation is a dreadful<br/>way to go.")
('Fie', 'So your plan is to win the game by murdering all the<br/>players at once.')
('Zin the Immovable', "The rumors don't do you justice. You're far more evil<br/>than they make you out to be.")
('Rixia', 'So you were planning to eliminate all of the players in<br/>one move...')
('Cao', "You've quite the imagination. You may be a more<br/>cunning schemer than I.")
('Shizuna', "Hmm... Isn't there a technique in the Rougetsu<br/>school that can do something similar?")
('Kurogane', 'There is. Though it would not be easy to use on this<br/>large of a scale.')
('Harwood', "My plan doesn't break any of the rules they laid out.")
('Harwood', 'Though that was never a concern of mine. After all, I<br/>am the Oathbreaker. Breaking oaths and rules is what<br/>I do.')
('Harwood', "And you can't deny it's the most effective way to win<br/>the game. I'm taking out all the players—and the<br/>organizers—in one fell swoop.")
('Harwood', "I'll spare you alone. That's your reward for figuring<br/>out my plan. You can run along back to the city and<br/>take care of requests while we wrap this up.")
('Harwood', 'Not a bad deal, huh?')
('Aaron', "'Not a bad deal,' my ass! You're no better<br/>than Almata!")
('Feri', "There are rules that have to be followed—even<br/>during war. We won't let you get away with this!")
('Van', "Well, at least you're not involvin' innocent civilians...")
('Van', "...is what I'd like to say, but you and I both know that<br/>the rules are the only reason why you're leaving them<br/>out of this.")
('Harwood', 'Heh. I make decisions like that on a<br/>case-by-case basis.')
('Van', "And I'm makin' the executive decision to smash your<br/>face in.")
('Van', "As soon as you're out of the game, you can't interfere<br/>with any of the players, which means your plan will be<br/>dead in the water.")
('Harwood', "Heheh. So you're going to stand in my way?")
('Harwood', "Back to Plan A, then. We're going to murder you all.<br/>I look forward to seeing you writhe in agony.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'Splendid! I find this plan to be much more to<br/>my tastes.')
('Walter the Direwolf', "Your tastes are wack as hell, but for once, you and I<br/>are on the same page. Nothin' excites me more than<br/>tradin' blows with some strong opponents.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Hope you kids can give me a run for my money,<br/>'cause you aren't weaselin' your way outta this one!")
('Judith', 'Ugh... These guys are gonna be tough!')
('Agnès', "I know, but we can't afford to lose. We have to<br/>stop them!")
('Quatre', "Right. I won't allow them to make use of<br/>chemical weapons. Many lives are on the line!")
('Van', "And ours are, too, so don't hold back! We'll be<br/>counting on you, Master!")
('Bergard', 'You will have my full support!')
('Harwood', 'Oho.')
('Aaron', '*pant* Those guys are...inhuman.')
('Feri', 'At least we took two of them down.')
('Zin the Immovable', "I'm not so sure about that.")
('Rixia', "I wouldn't be so sure of that.")
('Shizuna', 'You sure about that?')
('Walter the Direwolf', "Heh. I thought I'd be fine with just having a taste,<br/>but I was dead wrong. I want the full course.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "We're happy to aid you in stopping his scheme if you<br/>play with us for just a while longer.")
('Judith', "You've got to be kidding me...")
('Quatre', 'I-I can barely move a muscle...')
('Harwood', '...Heh.')
('Bergard', "Finally ready to fight, are you? I won't let you lay a<br/>finger on them!")
('Van', "(I was hoping I wouldn't have to transform yet, but it<br/>looks like I don't have a choice...)")
('Harwood', 'Well done. You beat us fair and square.')
('System', 'Received three keycards.')
('System', 'Received four keycards.')
('Van', 'Wait, what?!')
('System', 'Team Ouroboros has been eliminated.')
('Agnès', '...Huh?')
('Risette', "I don't understand...")
('Aaron', "WHAT?! You're forfeiting?!")
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Are you for real?')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'Heehee. I should have expected as much. He is<br/>nothing if not capricious.')
('Van', "...This is a trick, ain't it? What're you plotting<br/>this time?")
('Harwood', "Nothing. I'm just bored.")
('Harwood', 'I doubt we could kill all of you, and if word of my<br/>plan got out, everyone and their mother would come<br/>out to try and stop it.')
('Harwood', "If I can't have my fun, I'd rather bail.")
('Feri', 'Then why did you pick a fight with us in the<br/>first place?')
('Harwood', 'Because sitting back and watching you kids go at it<br/>sounded like a good time.')
('Walter the Direwolf', "I never wanted to go along with his plan in the first<br/>place, and now I can't even have the joy of<br/>fighting you... This sucks.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "I need to go hit something. Maybe I'll beat up some<br/>monsters or something. Catch you later.")
('Zin the Immovable', "Never thought I'd say this, but I kinda feel bad<br/>for him.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'I suppose we should get going as well. Toodeloo!')
('Harwood', "We're counting on you to bring down the house.<br/>You better earn that mira we're paying you.")
('Harwood', 'Make this game exciting until the very end.')
('Risette', 'The two Enforcers were fearsome foes all on their<br/>own, but he was on another level entirely.')
('Judith', "Yeah. We would've been royally screwed if he joined<br/>in on that fight.")
('Agnès', "And we might've been in even more trouble if you<br/>didn't see through his scheme.")
('Van', "I'm glad we prevented the worst-case scenario.")
('Van', "Anyway, we persevered and came out the other end<br/>with some keycards. Let's keep this up, you guys.")
('Van', "(We've seen all the main areas of the city now,<br/>including the ones we couldn't visit yesterday.)")
('Van', "(Second round starts at noon. Maybe now's a good<br/>time to head underground.)")
('System', "To advance the main story, select 'Wait in<br/>Cent. Underground Area' from the Travel menu.")
('System', 'Once you choose to wait in the central underground<br/>area, the main story will advance.')
('System', 'As a result, all unfinished quests and unseen<br/>sub-events will disappear.')
('System', "Van's group met up with their collaborators, and<br/>together, they made their way into the underground.")
('System', 'They arrived in the area where the first round<br/>concluded and waited for the second one to start.')
('System', 'Once you choose to go to Vashtar Palace, the main<br/>story will advance.')
('System', 'As a result, all unfinished quests and unseen<br/>sub-events will disappear.')
('Van', '...')
('Feri', 'You okay, Van?')
('Van', "Huh? Oh, yeah, I'm fine. Just thinkin'.")
('Agnès', 'Is there something bothering you?')
('Aaron', 'Guessing the stories about the gangsters and Almata<br/>remnants are on your mind.')
('Van', 'Yeah.')
('Van', "If Bermotti, Jack, and Kilika were all talkin' about<br/>them, then it's definitely worth mulling over.")
('Quatre', "We heard something interesting while following up<br/>on Dingo's case as well.")
('Risette', "We heard something interesting while following up<br/>on Mr. Brad's case as well.")
('Judith', "We heard something interesting while following up<br/>on Dingo's case, too.")
('Bergard', "You're referring to the account of them being sighted<br/>in the Tyrell District, correct?")
('Judith', "You're talking about how they were spotted in the<br/>Tyrell District, right?")
('Risette', 'You are referring to the account of them being<br/>sighted in the Tyrell District, yes?')
('Feri', 'Oh, yeah. Now that you mention it, that IS<br/>kinda worrying.')
('Feri', "Maybe we should drop by Tyrell. Just in case, y'know?")
('Van', "Not a bad idea. Can't hurt to check the area<br/>out again.")
('Van', 'Good idea. We need to check that area out anyway.')
('Van', 'We can probably rule out the busier parts of<br/>the district.')
('Aaron', "Same for the area near the restaurant that's run<br/>by Heiyue.")
('System', 'An additional mandatory investigation point has been<br/>added in the Tyrell District.')
('Van', "(Okay, we've combed the city pretty thoroughly, and<br/>the only thing outta place was the number of<br/>weirdos around.)")
('Van', "(Can't be too careful, I guess. Might be worth doin'<br/>another sweep of the city in the car just to be safe.)")
('Van', "(I should do that once I've taken care of all the<br/>4SPGs and the other stuff on our plate.)")
('System', "To advance the main story, select 'Finish Walking<br/>Around' from the Travel menu.")
('Van', '(Should I get in the car now?)')
('Van', "(Hopefully I'm just bein' paranoid about all this.<br/>Best to err on the side of caution, though.)")
('System', 'The main story will advance if you choose to get in<br/>the car. Unfinished quests and unseen sub-events<br/>will disappear.')
('Van', "(We're up against the clock now. Gotta make every<br/>move count.)")
('Van', "(Our next destination's the Seiden District.<br/>Then we'll go to the Auber District.)")
('System', 'Once a district has been selected, the others will be<br/>temporarily unavailable.')
('Van', "(Judith was in charge of Seiden. Dunno what she's<br/>gonna do in response to the time limit, but I wanna<br/>find her all the same.)")
('Van', "(Let's get a move on!)")
('Van', "(We've still got some time left. Should we head<br/>off early?)")
('System', 'Should you choose to set off, there will be no<br/>turning back. Be sure to do everything you want to do<br/>in the city before you leave.')
('Van', '(Actually, might be worth getting my girl seen to<br/>before we head off.)')
('Van', "(I'm rackin' up debts like there's no tomorrow.<br/>Didn't think I'd ever owe so much to so<br/>many people...)")
('Van', "(Oh, well. Gotta do what you've gotta do.)")
('Van', "I think that's about all there is to see in Old Town.")
('Agnès', "All right. Next, we need to head to Station Street so<br/>we can take care of Lott's request.")
('Van', "Got'cha. We can also check out the bulletin board<br/>while we're there. Might have some 4SPGs.")
('Van', "Let's head on over.")
('System', 'You can now visit Station Street.')
('Van', "Okay, I think it's about time we clock out.<br/>Good work today.")
('Agnès', "That was more difficult than I expected...<br/>Though isn't it a bit early? I don't mind putting in a<br/>few more hours.")
('Van', "My girl, it's your first day. No need to go so hard<br/>right off the bat.")
('Van', "But if you've got some spare hours, we can hit up the<br/>orbal café in front of the station. Whaddaya say?")
('Van', "I'll even treat you. Think of it as a sign-on bonus.")
('Agnès', 'Ooh, really? Are you sure?')
('Van', "Course I'm sure. You've more than earned it—and I<br/>can tell you're gonna be a great asset.")
('Van', "Man, I can almost taste the cream on that new<br/>latte already! I'm gonna die and go to dessert heaven!")
('Agnès', "(...He just wants to go so he can indulge himself in<br/>sweets, doesn't he? Figures.)")
('Agnès', "Heehee. Well, I'm ready to go when you are.")
('Van', "Okay, I think that's all the info we're gonna get here.<br/>Next stop is New Town.")
('Feri', "Wasn't that the first place we went to when we<br/>arrived in Langport?")
('Van', "Yep. It's just over the bridge, so we can just walk right<br/>on over. No need to take the car.")
('Van', '...Hmm? I wonder who that is?')
('Ashen', 'Hello again!')
('Agnès', "Oh, it's Ashen.")
('Van', "Didn't think we'd be hearing from you again so soon.<br/>Did the situation take a turn for the worse?")
('Ashen', "No, don't worry. That's not why I'm calling.")
('Ashen', 'I actually wanted to give you all a request.')
('Van', "Oh, got'cha. Then give me the details, and I'll decide<br/>if the job's right for us.")
('Ashen', "All righty. Here's the rundown: there's a problem in a<br/>tourist area that's managed by Heiyue.")
('Ashen', 'A dangerous monster showed up out of nowhere, so<br/>tours are being put on hold.')
('Van', 'And you need us to take care of it?')
('Van', "I heard Heiyue's on guard 'cause of Almata, so I'm<br/>guessing their hands are a bit tied at the moment.")
('Van', "And if they turned to the guild, it'd seem like they<br/>couldn't handle problems on their own turf. Got an<br/>image to protect, right?")
('Ashen', "You got it. Think you can handle this? I'll pay above<br/>the guild's rate.")
('Van', "Well, I think it meets our standards, but we've got a<br/>packed schedule. I gotta see if we have time to fit<br/>it in.")
('Ashen', "Oh, of course. If you don't have the time, that's<br/>perfectly fine.")
('Ashen', "We'll be able to take care of it by ourselves eventually,<br/>but we'd just rather have the matter settled sooner<br/>rather than later.")
('Ashen', 'The ferryman by the wharf in the Eastern Quarter<br/>will fill you in on the specifics if you decide to take<br/>the job.')
('Feri', "Taking on a big monster sounds like it'd be a fun<br/>change of pace.")
('Agnès', "That qualifies as a fun change of pace to you?<br/>That's...mildly concerning.")
('Van', 'Either way, if we got the time to do it, we should.')
('Van', '(Might be worth dropping by New Town to get<br/>our equipment in order.)')
('Van', "All right, that's it for this area, I think. Shame we<br/>didn't learn anything worthwhile.")
('Feri', "So what's our next move?")
('Van', "I think we're gonna have to resort to venturin' into<br/>enemy turf.")
('Agnès', "By 'enemy turf,' do you mean the Messeldam Trading<br/>Company building?")
('Van', "That's right. It's a risky play, and it might just end up<br/>being a waste of time. We don't got many other<br/>options, though.")
('Van', "Watch your backs, and don't get too far ahead of me.")
('Feri', 'Understood.')
('Agnès', 'Got it.')
('Van', "Man, time sure flies when you're hard at work.")
('Risette', "Indeed. It's nearly lunchtime, in fact. We should<br/>probably take a break soon.")
('Van', "Yeah, good idea. We'll probably be swamped in<br/>the afternoon.")
('Agnès', 'Should we grab a bite to eat at the inn?')
('Aaron', "We always do that, though. Can't we shake things up<br/>a bit?")
('Feri', "How about we go down to the marketplace?<br/>They've got all sorts of unique food there.")
('Van', "I'd be down for that.")
('Van', "Let's find ourselves a table in the open area and<br/>chow down.")
('Van', "(If we've finished our business, we might as well chill<br/>and wait for the parade to start.)")
('System', 'If you choose to wait for the parade, the main story<br/>will advance. Unfinished quests will disappear.')
('Van', "We've got a lot of info to work with now.")
('Aaron', "Yeah, but I can't wrap my head around how it all<br/>fits together.")
('Agnès', 'Maybe talking it out will help. Is there a place we can<br/>chat in private?')
('Feri', 'We can always head back to the inn.')
('Quatre', 'Actually, how about you all come to my place?')
('Quatre', "You won't have to worry about people listening<br/>in there.")
('Agnès', "Oh, no. We couldn't impose on you like that.")
('Quatre', "I really don't mind, and neither would Gran—erm,<br/>Professor Hamilton.")
('Quatre', "It's her house, but I'm the only one who lives there<br/>right now.")
('Van', "Cool. We'll take you up on your offer. Kinda curious<br/>to see the home of one of Epstein's three disciples.")
('Quatre', "Oh, I wouldn't expect too much. It's just a normal<br/>family home.")
('Quatre', "Anyway, we can head over whenever you'd like.")
('Van', "Okay, that's enough info gathering. Doubt we'll learn<br/>anything new here.")
('Judith', "I still have no clue why she's acting like this, though...")
('Van', "Maybe it'll all start makin' sense once we put our<br/>heads together.")
('Van', "Let's call the others. We can all meet up at the hotel<br/>and start hashing this out.")
('Zin the Immovable', "Okay, we're gonna head off now. See you around.")
('Fie', 'Let us know if anything comes up.')
('Van', 'Will do. Thanks.')
('System', 'Zin and Fie left the party.')
('Van', "...Huh? Who's this?")
('Bracer Alvis', "Spriggan! You haven't seen Elaine anywhere,<br/>have you?!")
('Van', "Oh, it's you. What's got you so worked up?")
('Bracer Alvis', 'Just answer the question! Have you seen her or not?')
('Van', "I haven't, no. Did something happen?")
('Bracer Alvis', "She's done it again...")
('Van', "You're at the guild, right? I wanna hear more about<br/>this, so I'm heading over.")
('Bracer Alvis', '...All right.')
('Bracer Alvis', "But be quick about it! I'll tell you more when you<br/>get here.")
('Quatre', "That didn't sound good...")
('Feri', "That didn't sound good...")
('Bergard', 'He seemed...perturbed.')
('Judith', 'Should we go right away? Or should we wait for<br/>the others?')
('Van', 'Nah, this sounds urgent.')
('Van', "Let's get to the guild ASAP.")
('System', 'Eventually, they reached a point where they could<br/>take a break.')
('System', 'As such, everyone went their separate ways for<br/>a while.')
('Van', "Something was off about Agnès earlier. She looked<br/>kinda down. Maybe she's got something on<br/>her mind?")
('Van', "Dunno if she wants to talk about it, but I'll at least<br/>offer to lend an ear. A good boss should always be<br/>lookin' after their employees.")
('Van', 'Now where did she say she was headed... I think it<br/>was Station Street, maybe?')
('Van', "(That's the last of the 4SPGs. I can't smell anythin'<br/>out of place now.)")
('Van', "(This'd be a good time for a break. Then we can take<br/>it easy after that.)")
('System', 'One additional free time point was added for<br/>completing all of the 4SPGs.')
('Agnès', 'Are we ready to get to work?')
('Feri', 'Uh-huh. We should start by finding someone who<br/>knows Jessica.')
('Van', 'And I know the perfect person to ask.')
('Van', "There's a producer who often hangs out around the<br/>Tyrell District to try and recruit new people to<br/>be mannequins.")
('Van', "Let's talk to him before we try askin' anyone else.<br/>Might save us a lot of wandering around.")
('Feri', "Manny...kin? I've never heard of that. What do<br/>they do?")
('Agnès', "He means models—people who wear clothes to<br/>advertise new outfits. And Van's right that Jessica is<br/>pretty enough to be noticed by a producer.")
('Van', "So as soon as we're ready, we should make for the<br/>Tyrell District.")
('Van', "Sorry. We're gonna have to turn back for a while.")
('Kwan', "No worries! Just let me know when you're ready<br/>to resume.")
('Kwan', "I'll be waiting to join you!")
('Agnès', 'Thank you.')
('Aaron', 'Nice. We got way more clues here than I expected.')
('Agnès', 'The two accounts we heard both involved a Red<br/>Star transport...')
('Agnès', '...which leads me to believe we are dealing with<br/>one—and only one—vehicle.')
('Feri', "I'm still freaking out about the whole 'driverless<br/>truck' thing.")
('Van', "Don't blame ya. The fact that it happened at night<br/>turns this whole thing into a bona fide ghost story.")
('Van', "There's probably a logical explanation, though, and<br/>I'm sure Quatre can provide it.")
('Feri', 'Wait, for real?')
('Agnès', 'Oh, is it related to technology you have insider<br/>knowledge about?')
('Quatre', 'Correct. I believe it is utilizing tech that is currently<br/>in the R&D phase of development in many countries.')
('Quatre', "It's called an automated vehicle, and it allows a person<br/>to go from place to place without lifting a finger—<br/>because a holo core is doing the driving.")
('Quatre', "The fact that it kept going in spite of the empty<br/>soda can makes me strongly suspect it's an<br/>AI-controlled vehicle.")
('Agnès', 'My suspicions were correct, then. Renne told me a<br/>little about this before.')
('Feri', "Wow! That's so cool! So that means it wasn't a ghost.<br/>Phew...")
('Aaron', 'Well, you never know. Maybe there WAS a driver—<br/>until his shitty job worked him to death. Now he lives<br/>on as a vengeful ghost behind the wheel...')
('Aaron', "Wait, what's that? Oh, SHIT! It's right behind<br/>you, Ferida!")
('Feri', 'Wha...?! EEEEEK!')
('Feri', "...Hey! There's nothing there!")
('Aaron', "BAHAHAHA! You should've seen the look on<br/>your face!")
('Agnès', 'Why are you like this...?')
('Van', 'You want me to stop calling you a kid, stop acting<br/>like one.')
('Van', "Back on topic. There was an incident regarding<br/>unmanned driving tech. Everyone in the underworld<br/>was goin' on and on about it at the time.")
('Van', "So I'm amazed this thing is driving around the city<br/>without causing any problems. It's kinda insane.")
('Quatre', "I'm not too surprised. You could prevent most<br/>accidents by connecting it to the traffic management<br/>system and the info on the city roads.")
('Quatre', "The technology should be state of the art. In fact, I<br/>suspect it's the same tech that caused Professor<br/>Callaghan's downfall.")
('Feri', 'Oh...')
('Agnès', "I-I'm sorry, Quatre...")
('Quatre', "You've nothing to be sorry for. And I'm all<br/>right, promise. Now's not the time to wallow<br/>in sentimentality.")
('Quatre', "So what's the plan, Van?")
('Quatre', "The AI's functionality and patterns could make it<br/>quite difficult to capture.")
('Van', "I know. Normally, I'd be fine with dumping this on<br/>the second lieutenant or the cops.")
('Van', "But I'm a car lover at heart, and I do NOT like seein'<br/>them be used as vehicles for bringing weapons into<br/>the city. This shit is personal.")
('Aaron', 'Figures. Well, any bright ideas, chief?')
('Van', 'First order of business is seeing how far this AI can<br/>really go.')
('Van', "Also, I'm gonna bring on some outside help for<br/>this gig.")
('Quatre', 'What kind of outside help?')
('Feri', "Wait, you don't mean them, do you?")
('Van', "Bingo. And they're right here in Basel, so I'm gonna<br/>call 'em up right now.")
('System', 'Van used his Xipha to get in touch with Junifer and<br/>the others.')
('System', 'The party then headed to the Motor Pavilion in New<br/>Town where they were waiting.')
('Agnès', 'Umm, do you have somebody in mind?')
('Van', "Yep.<br/>(I heard that they'd be here...)")
('System', 'Van used his Xipha to get in touch with some familiar<br/>faces in Basel.')
('System', 'The party then headed to the Motor Pavilion in New<br/>Town where they were waiting.')
('Van', 'Should I go talk to that idol about her friend now?')
('Van', "I've gotta do it soon, but it doesn't have to be<br/>right now.")
('System', 'Once you start this 4SPG, you will no longer be able<br/>to use your free time points.')
('System', 'You will also no longer be able to walk around the<br/>capital freely.')
('Van', 'All right. Let me go see my client.')
('Van', 'Actually, I think there was some other stuff I wanted<br/>to do.')
('Van', "I'll take care of that first before goin' to see her.")
('Agnès', "Okay. That's three locations down.")
('Feri', "Now all that's left is the red tram.")
('Van', 'Hmm...')
('Van', "At this time of day, it's gonna be at the stop in the<br/>North District.")
('Aaron', "Wait, you've got the tram schedule memorized?<br/>What a nerd.")
('Van', "Hey, I ain't a nerd. I just spent a lot of time looking<br/>for the thing as a kid, so its schedule is burned into<br/>my memory.")
('Van', "Anyway, let's get on over there.")
('Van', "Okay, we've got all four answers.")
('Bergard', "Let's return to our clients quickly, then.")
('Aaron', "Good idea. I'd rather not find a pile of splattered<br/>remains when we get back.")
('Agnès', 'Aaron! Not appropriate!')
('Van', "Looks like we've found our prey.")
('Fie', 'They look perky.')
('Rixia', 'They look fierce.')
('Shizuna', 'They look lively.')
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Nice. Fresh meat.')
('Aaron', "I don't remember seeing other monsters like them<br/>down here before.")
('Feri', "I don't remember seeing other monsters like them<br/>down here before!")
('Quatre', "I don't remember seeing other monsters like them<br/>down here before.")
('Van', "Me, neither. Maybe Almata unleashed 'em today<br/>or somethin'.")
('Van', "Doesn't change what we've gotta do, though.<br/>Let's tear 'em up!")
('Risette', 'Mission complete.')
('Van', 'Whew. Good work, everyone.')
('Van', 'Thanks for the help, guys. Sorry we dragged you<br/>into this.')
('Zin the Immovable', "Don't be sorry! This kinda work normally falls in our<br/>jurisdiction anyway, so if anything, you were<br/>helping us.")
('Van', 'Heh. Fair enough.')
('Cao', 'Not at all. This benefits us quite nicely, anyway.')
('Cao', 'Monsters of this caliber would have hindered our<br/>investigation of the ruins later.')
('Van', 'Up to shady shit as usual, I see. Why am I<br/>not surprised?')
('Shizuna', "Don't be sorry! This was the perfect outlet to vent my<br/>frustration after my fight with the Khamsin was cut<br/>oh-so short.")
('Van', 'You WANTED to fight that bastard? Man, you<br/>really are insane...')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'Not at all. This was quite the pleasant diversion.')
('Bergard', 'Hmm... There was something peculiar about<br/>our prey.')
('Judith', "I'm glad I wasn't the only one who thought so.<br/>There was something weird about their behavior, but<br/>I can't put my finger on what...")
('Van', "Well, no use thinkin' about it now. Let's just move on<br/>to the next request.")
('Judith', "Let's do this!")
('Risette', 'Careful. They look strong.')
('Fie', "We'll be fine.")
('Rixia', "I'm sure we can handle them.")
('Kurogane', 'True, but I doubt they will be any match for us.')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'Heehee. The stronger, the better.')
('Van', "Don't underestimate 'em. We might be in for a nasty<br/>surprise here.")
('Quatre', 'Well, that takes care of that. You were right about us<br/>being in for a surprise.')
('Aaron', 'That about wraps that up. You were right about us<br/>being in for a surprise.')
('Feri', 'Okay, that takes care of that. You were right about us<br/>being in for a surprise.')
('Judith', "I'm starting to see a pattern here.")
('Risette', 'Indeed. These monsters are utilizing shard skills—of<br/>that I am certain.')
('Aaron', 'But I thought only humans could use those?')
('Feri', 'But I thought only humans could use those?!')
('Risette', 'That was my understanding as well. They are<br/>supposed to be a special feature of Xipha technology.')
('Quatre', "That was my understanding, too. They're supposed to<br/>be a special feature of Xipha technology.")
('Van', "I mean, it's not that much of a stretch, right?<br/>We've seen monsters that use orbal arts, and they sure<br/>as hell aren't packin' orbments.")
('Van', "I can buy that some of 'em have the potential to use<br/>shard skills, too.")
('Bergard', "I suppose it's not inconceivable that they have evolved<br/>with our technology, but it's happening too fast.")
('Zin the Immovable', "Yeah. Something's fishy here.")
('Cao', 'What a fascinating conundrum.')
('Shizuna', 'This is getting interesting.')
('Walter the Direwolf', "This is gettin' interesting.")
('Risette', 'Perhaps the answers will come to us after we finish<br/>the third request. Shall we work on that next?')
('Van', "Up to y'all. Won't deny I'm curious about the whole<br/>shard skill thing, but the third request's optional.")
('Van', "Bare minimum was to finish two, so we've fulfilled<br/>our obligations here.")
('Van', "If you guys're wiped out, we can leave the last one to<br/>some other group.")
('Judith', "Now that you mention it, I'm pooped. And<br/>thirsty, too.")
('Judith', "You guys wanna head back to the surface? I'd kill for<br/>an ice-cold drink right about now.")
('Van', 'I feel you there.')
('Van', 'Well, we got some time, so if you guys wanna take a<br/>break and come back later, we can do that.')
('Van', "I'll leave the choice up to y'all.")
('Quatre', "Let's finish this!")
('Aaron', "Let's end this!")
('Feri', "Let's finish this!")
('Judith', 'Right!')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Time for a beatdown!')
('Rixia', 'I will show no mercy!')
('Kurogane', 'Then let our battle begin!')
('Walter the Direwolf', "I'm gonna go hog wild!")
('Van', 'Keep an eye out for shard skills, everyone!')
('Van', "Let's do this thing!")
('Risette', 'Enemy shard skills were in play here as well...')
('Aaron', 'Whew. These requests were brutal. Good thing we<br/>took those things out before they escaped and raised<br/>hell on the surface.')
('Feri', "Whew. These requests were tough! It's a good thing<br/>we took those things out before they escaped and hurt<br/>a bunch of people on the surface.")
('Quatre', "Phew. These requests were surprisingly difficult.<br/>I hope we don't come across any monsters like those<br/>in the future...")
('Van', "Wonder where these things came from. It's not every<br/>day you run into monsters who can use shard skills.")
('Bergard', 'Indeed. There must be more to this story than meets<br/>the eye.')
('Fie', "Hmm? There's something on the floor.")
('Rixia', 'There seems to be something on the floor...')
('Shizuna', "Hmm? There's something on the floor.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "Hmm? There's something on the ground.")
('Van', 'Oh?')
('Judith', "Looks like a machine part or something. It<br/>says 'ZA-SSM03'... What could that mean?")
('Risette', "I believe SSM may stand for 'Shard Skill Module'.")
('Risette', 'And the 03 would indicate that this is the third<br/>such module.')
('Quatre', 'What?!')
('Quatre', 'Then they were only able to use shard skills because<br/>of this unit?')
('Aaron', 'What the hell?!')
('Aaron', 'So they were able to use shard skills because of<br/>this thing?')
('Risette', 'That is but one possibility. Though it is likely, yes.')
('Bergard', 'That would certainly explain it.')
('Judith', "It's kinda hard to believe, but it's just about the only<br/>explanation that makes sense.")
('Zin the Immovable', "Yeah, I'm starting to buy it, too. But what could the<br/>'ZA' part mean?")
('Cao', "Fascinating. But you haven't explained the 'ZA'<br/>portion of the code. What could that mean?")
('Kurogane', "Agreed. But what of the 'ZA' portion the code?")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Isn't that somethin'. So what's the 'ZA' bit, then?")
('Van', "I have a feeling it comes from a name we've all<br/>heard recently.")
('Van', 'The up-and-coming weapons manufacturer that just<br/>so happened to make an appearance in this game:<br/>Zecht Arms.')
('Quatre', 'That would make sense...')
('Aaron', 'They were one of the teams that made it to the third<br/>round, right?')
('Feri', 'Wait, really? Them?')
('Aaron', 'They were one of the teams that made it to the third<br/>round, right?')
('Feri', 'Wait, really? Them?')
('Quatre', "They were one of the teams that made it to the third<br/>round, weren't they?")
('Van', "You probably know more about 'em than any of us,<br/>Risette, since, well, they're your competitor.")
('Risette', 'I would not consider them a full-on competitor, but<br/>yes, I am aware of their general operations and have<br/>kept abreast of their developments.')
('Risette', 'The company was established about five years ago,<br/>and they have been aggressively increasing their<br/>market share since before the war began.')
('Risette', 'Their recent attempts to expand into contracted<br/>security put them in direct competition with us.')
('Risette', "They have seen little success in that area, but that<br/>hasn't deterred them.")
('Risette', 'I have heard rumors that they were experimenting<br/>with traditional weaponry and patrol machinery.')
('Judith', 'I wonder if the things we just fought were the result<br/>of that.')
('Quatre', "But what's the benefit in giving monsters the ability<br/>to use shard skills? Why go to all this effort?")
('Quatre', "Oh. Perhaps they're seeking to use that technology to<br/>control the monsters.")
('Aaron', "But what's the point in giving monsters the ability to<br/>use shard skills? Seems like a lot of work for<br/>no payoff.")
('Aaron', "No, wait. They might be able to use this tech to<br/>control monsters. Maybe that's what they're after?")
('Van', 'Might be on to something.')
('Van', "But if that's their endgame, I doubt they're<br/>under contract. I'm thinkin' they came of their<br/>own volition.")
('Van', "Can't deny that winning this game is a decent way to<br/>get your name out there. Good for optics, too.")
('Risette', "And there's another undeniable benefit.")
('Risette', 'This place is a breeding ground for powerful<br/>monsters, which makes it a perfect venue to test their<br/>new weaponry.')
('Bergard', 'And by pitting them against us and the other players,<br/>they can gather a not-insignificant amount of<br/>combat data.')
('Bergard', '(Hmm...)')
('Van', "(What's he thinkin' about?)")
('Zin the Immovable', "So they're taking advantage of this situation AND<br/>making use of the monsters here for their own ends.")
('Fie', "What they're doing has suspicious written all over it.")
('Zin the Immovable', "Won't argue with you there. Though as long as they<br/>aren't laying a finger on any civilians, our hands<br/>are tied.")
('Zin the Immovable', "But if we could prove they're doing something illegal,<br/>that'd be a whole different story.")
('Fie', "We'll just keep this in the back of our minds for now.")
('Cao', 'So they donned the role of puppeteer. They placed<br/>those monsters on a string and had them dancing to<br/>their whims.')
('Cao', "It's such an ingenious idea, I'm almost jealous I didn't<br/>come up with it myself.")
('Aaron', 'You better not be thinking about stealing it.')
('Van', "Better not be thinkin' about stealing it.")
('Rixia', "I doubt he would stoop that low, but he's almost<br/>certainly thinking about striking a deal with them at<br/>this very moment.")
('Cao', 'You know me too well.')
('Rixia', 'Sadly...')
('Shizuna', "Controlling monsters with technology? Well, that's a<br/>new one.")
('Kurogane', 'They claim to be an ordinary weapons manufacturer,<br/>but they are clearly anything but.')
('Shizuna', "The tech's clearly far from complete, though, so I'd<br/>say they're still no match for you and your company.")
('Risette', 'You flatter us.')
('Harwood', "So they're controlling monsters with technology, huh?")
('Harwood', "Heheh. I see Marduk isn't the only company that's<br/>concocting devious schemes behind the scenes.")
('Bergard', 'That voice!')
('Van', 'The Oathbreaker!')
('Harwood', "I thought you were only going out to kill time.<br/>I didn't think you would chance on something<br/>so exciting.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'Nor did I.')
('Van', 'You heard everything we were saying, huh?')
('Harwood', 'Not everything. I only started listening in after<br/>Walter called me.')
('Judith', "Wow. You're actually reporting to your boss?<br/>He must have you on a tight leash if you're being an<br/>obedient little dog.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Pshaw. It ain't like that. I just couldn't be assed to<br/>explain it all to him once we got back.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "You guys better watch out, by the way. If he got his<br/>grubby little hands on this tech, there's no tellin' what<br/>carnage he'd create.")
('Harwood', "To be honest, I'd say this is more up the<br/>professor's alley. This stuff's way outside<br/>my wheelhouse.")
('Van', "I hope I don't need to remind you that you better<br/>not—")
('Harwood', "I know, I know. I'm just taking notes for<br/>future reference.")
('Harwood', "I'll leave you be for now. I'm eagerly awaiting the<br/>final act of this thrilling drama.")
('Van', "You can't let your guard down around that guy for<br/>even a second...")
('Van', "Anyway, that's the last of the monster<br/>extermination requests.")
('Risette', 'Indeed. I am concerned about what Zecht Arms is<br/>plotting, but we have more urgent matters to<br/>attend to.')
('Van', "Yeah. For now we've gotta get back to the surface and<br/>start getting ready for the final round.")
('Van', '(Oh, right. Those street racers asked me to do<br/>some scouting.)')
('Van', "(Wonder if he'd be interested in takin' part?)")
('Aaron', "Huh? What'cha staring at me for? If you've got<br/>something to say, then say it.")
('Van', "(Well, can't hurt to ask.)")
('Van', "I've got a question for ya. You see, a bunch of racers<br/>asked me to do something for 'em, and...")
('System', 'Van explained the details of the request.')
('Aaron', 'So you want me to be a part of this race, huh?')
('Van', 'Yeah. You got something to drive with?')
('Aaron', "I'm borrowing your old master's motorbike till the<br/>end of the festival, so I could use that.")
('Aaron', 'Though it could get damaged in the race. Maybe I<br/>should run this past him first...')
('Aaron', "Eh, I'm lazy. It should be fine.")
('Van', 'Get your ass on the phone, my dude.')
('Aaron', 'Fiiiiiine.')
('System', 'Aaron reached out to Bergard.')
('Aaron', "Done. He said, 'Go wild.'")
('Van', "Cool. That's one less person I need to find. But be<br/>EXTRA careful not to damage it, you hear?")
('Aaron', 'I know, I know. Lay off me, will you?')
('Van', "Well, I've hit up everyone I can think of.")
('Van', "Guess all that's left is to loop back with the racers.")
('Van', "I'm working on a job at the moment, and there was<br/>something I wanted to ask you about.")
('Bergard', "Oh? Well, I'm all ears.")
('System', 'Van explained the details of the request.')
('Bergard', 'You want me to participate in a racing competition?<br/>Hmm... Why not ask Aaron instead?')
('Van', "Huh? Why him? You're the one with the motorbike.")
('Bergard', 'Actually, I lent it to him for the duration of<br/>the festival.')
('Bergard', "He would jump at the chance to join. I'm sure he'd<br/>love to put those wheels through their paces.")
('Van', "I guess. I could see him gettin' a kick outta this.")
('Van', "But the same goes for you, Master. I figured you'd<br/>enjoy the thrill of the race.")
('Bergard', "I would rather pass the torch to you young'uns.<br/>I'm getting too old for this, I'm afraid.")
('Bergard', "Why don't you give him a call? I'm sure he'd say yes<br/>in a heartbeat.")
('Van', 'All righty. One minute.')
('System', 'Van reached out to Aaron.')
('Van', "Welp, you were right. Soon as the word 'race' left my<br/>mouth, he was right on board.")
('Bergard', 'Heh. I thought as much.')
('Bergard', "I'm sure he will have a great time. You all have fun<br/>out there.")
('Van', "Awesome. That's one less person I need to find.")
('Van', "Well, I've hit up everyone I can think of.")
('Van', "All that's left is to loop back with the racers.")
('Van', "There's still a lingering scent. Gotta check the other<br/>bulletin boards.")
('Van', "Hmm... The scent's still not gone. I'll check the<br/>next board.")
('Van', "Okay, the scent's gone. Means all the boards have<br/>been checked.")
('Agnès', 'That means we have a total of three tasks to take care<br/>of today.')
('Feri', "So we've got three tasks to take care of today, huh?")
('Aaron', 'Only three tasks for today? Nice.')
('Van', "All right. We've met our quota for the day.")
('Van', "We can take care of the other job if we want, but it<br/>ain't mandatory.")
('Van', "We've gotta take care of at least two jobs today.")
('Van', "We've gotta take care of at least two jobs today.<br/>Let's get 'em done.")
('Van', 'Oh, this job looks interesting.')
('Van', "There's still a lingering scent. Gotta check the other<br/>bulletin boards.")
('Van', "Hmm... The scent's still not gone. I'll check the<br/>next board.")
('Van', "Okay, that's all the boards checked.")
('Risette', "We have three jobs on today's docket.")
('Van', "Yeah. We've already hit our quota, but if you guys<br/>wanna take care of this one, too, then I'm game.")
('Van', "Yeah. We've gotta at least take care of two of 'em by<br/>the day's end.")
('Agnès', 'All right, then.')
('Van', "There's still a lingering scent. Gotta check the other<br/>bulletin boards.")
('Van', "No more scent, which means we're done with<br/>inspecting bulletin boards for today.")
('Van', "If we can take care of at least one job, I'll be happy.")
('Van', "Today's quota has been met, but if we've got the time,<br/>we should finish the other job, too.")
('Quatre', 'Understood.')
('Quatre', "I believe I'm qualified to help with the orbal<br/>network-related one.")
('Van', "Oh, I'm sure you're more than qualified.<br/>Lookin' forward to seeing you kick ass on<br/>the keyboard.")
('Judith', 'So this is how you go around accepting jobs, huh?')
('Van', "There's still a lingering scent. Gotta check the other<br/>bulletin boards.")
('Van', "Scent's gone, so we're done inspecting<br/>bulletin boards.")
('Van', "We've got two requests. I'd like to handle at least one<br/>of 'em.")
('Van', "One request down. We can call it here, but I'd like to<br/>finish the other one if we can.")
('Judith', 'Got it.')
('Van', "There's still a lingering scent. Gotta check the other<br/>bulletin boards.")
('Van', "I ain't smellin' the usual scent, so I think the bulletin<br/>board hunt's over.")
('Van', "There's still a lingering scent. Gotta check the other<br/>bulletin boards.")
('Van', "Hmm... The scent's still not gone. I'll check the<br/>next board.")
('Van', "Okay, that should be all the bulletin boards that've<br/>got a scent.")
('Van', "I'd like to get through as many of these requests as we<br/>can, but that all depends on how busy we are.")
('Van', "I sure didn't expect us to get a job from<br/>Odette, though.")
('Agnès', "It's certainly interesting, isn't it? I'll fill you in on the<br/>details when we're with the others.")
('Van', "Can't say I'm not intrigued. Definitely wanna hear<br/>about that one.")
('Quatre', 'Looks like we got some 4SPGs.')
('Quatre', "Looks like we got some 4SPGs after all. The people<br/>from the society actually did what they said they'd do.")
('Van', "Guess so. We've got more free time today, so let's see<br/>if we can knock some of 'em out.")
('Bergard', 'And who knows? We may find some useful<br/>information while we do so.')
('Van', "True, but don't forget that Almata's game is our<br/>first priority.")
('Judith', 'Right. Makes sense.')
('System', 'Agnès parted ways with Van and set off for the café<br/>terrace in the Tyrell District.')
('System', 'Feri parted ways with Van and set off for the public<br/>baths in Old Town.')
('System', 'Aaron parted ways with Van and set off for the stalls<br/>in the Riverside District.')
('System', 'Risette parted ways with Van and set off for the orbal<br/>café on Station Street.')
('System', 'Quatre parted ways with Van and set off for the<br/>cathedral in the Auber District.')
('System', 'Judith parted ways with Van and set off for the hotel<br/>in the Seiden District.')
('System', 'Bergard parted ways with Van and set off for the<br/>arena in the Blacklight District.')
('System', 'Choose your preferred settings for the simulation.')
('System', 'Turn off the simulator?')
('System', 'Begin the simulation?')
('Quatre', 'I wonder if I could forge a weapon with Onyx Steel?')
('Van', "I'll bet you could if you put your mind to it.")
('Quatre', 'Supervisor Giscard did teach me how to work with<br/>special alloys.')
('Quatre', 'Theoretically, if I apply that same knowledge to this<br/>Onyx Steel, I should be able to make a very<br/>powerful weapon.')
('Van', "That'd be sick. You're pretty damn<br/>resourceful, Quatre.")
('Quatre', "Thanks. Though I'm sure the supervisor is better<br/>suited to this task...")
('Quatre', "Regardless, I'll do my best.")
('Van', "And that's all anyone can ever ask of you.")
('Quatre', 'Who should I make this for?')
('Quatre', 'Got it.')
('Quatre', 'And...done!')
('System', 'Obtained <br/>.')
('System', 'Obtained <br/>.')
('System', 'Obtained <br/>.')
('System', 'Obtained <br/>.')
('System', 'Obtained <br/>.')
('System', 'Obtained <br/>.')
('System', 'Obtained <br/>.')
('System', 'Obtained <br/>.')
('Van', 'Awesome. Great job, Quatre.')
('System', 'Select one additional member to accompany Van.<br/>They can be swapped out later.')
('System', 'Select two additional members to accompany Van.')
('System', 'Select two additional members to accompany Van<br/>other than Agnès, Feri, and Aaron.')
('System', 'Select two additional members to accompany Van<br/>other than Judith and Agnès.')
('System', 'Select one additional member to accompany Van<br/>other than Quatre and Agnès.')
('System', 'Select one additional member to accompany Van<br/>and Risette.')
('System', 'Select one additional member to accompany Van<br/>other than Risette and Agnès.')
('System', 'Select one additional member to accompany Van.')
('System', 'HP and EP were fully restored!')
