('System', 'HP and EP were fully restored!')
('Rasham', 'I always knew something was fishy about those orbal<br/>hookahs, but I never imagined they were using<br/>unapproved ingredients!')
('Rasham', 'I had some in stock myself, unfortunately. Makes me<br/>glad I kept recommending the traditional ones<br/>to customers.')
('Rasham', 'I did get pretty worried since I had some customers<br/>who bought some of the orbal hookahs I had in stock.')
('Rasham', "Thankfully, from the way it looks this morning, they<br/>all seem to have calmed down. Can't tell you what a<br/>relief THAT is.")
('Rasham', 'The tourists have been getting pretty...rowdy, lately,<br/>to put it nicely.')
('Rasham', 'Another hookah seller I know was telling me about<br/>how his customers got in such a frenzy that things<br/>were a little out of hand.')
('Rasham', "I get everyone's excited about the film festival and all,<br/>but it's almost like they've properly lost their minds.")
('Rasham', 'My traditional, flame-powered hookahs still sell<br/>pretty well these days.')
('Rasham', "But it's these new orbal-powered hookahs that draw<br/>in all the repeat customers, now.")
('Rasham', "It's a shame. The old-fashioned ones still have a lot to<br/>offer, as long as you enjoy them in moderation.<br/>But times are what they are. *sigh*")
('Rasham', 'Welcome! Have you thought about treating yourself<br/>to a hookah? A nice, long hookah session is a<br/>traditional pastime in the Central East!')
('Rasham', "Not only do they smell nice, but they've a wonderful<br/>cooling sensation when smoked. Definitely a must in<br/>a place that gets as hot as Tharbad!")
('Rasham', 'Lately, these portable orbal-powered hookahs have<br/>been all the rage in Tharbad.')
('Rasham', "Honestly, though, I can't say I'm a big fan.<br/>They've got no class! In my book, nothing beats a<br/>good, old, traditional hookah.")
('Rasham', 'When tourists come to me looking for the hookah<br/>hookup, I want them to enjoy something with some<br/>real taste to it. Do it right, you know?')
('Rasham', "I offer orbal hookahs to those who want them, but<br/>otherwise, I don't go out of my way to push 'em on<br/>to folks. They just aren't my style.")
('Imani', 'Mother Jamileh said it was okay for me to go<br/>back outside.')
('Imani', "It's much calmer now than it was yesterday. I'm<br/>so glad!")
('Imani', "Clim's going home soon, so we're going to enjoy the<br/>film festival while we can!")
('Imani', "There are a lot of people yelling and fighting outside.<br/>It's safe inside the temple, though.")
('Imani', "But I'm worried about my mom. She works in<br/>the bazaar. I wish she could be with me here...")
('Imani', 'Clim is really interested in fairy tales. I wonder what<br/>sort of books he likes to read at home?')
('Imani', 'After talking to him, now I want to learn about<br/>stories from further west!')
('Imani', "I'm so happy Clim likes hearing about Central<br/>Eastern fairy tales!")
('Imani', "Most kids who visit Tharbad don't really care<br/>about them. It's so nice to meet someone who does!")
('Imani', '...And then, once the djinn appears from the lamp, it<br/>repeats the first word and leaves!')
('Clim', "Wow, that's awesome! Central Eastern fairy tales are<br/>so neat and cool!")
('Imani', 'Heehee, I know, right?')
('Imani', 'My grandma and the people from the temple tell me<br/>stories with different morals all the time!')
('Imani', "Do people like to tell any neat, weird stories where<br/>you're from? I'd love to hear them!")
('Clim', 'Sure! I can tell you about them!')
('Clim', 'But after that, I wanna hear more about your fairy<br/>tales, okay?')
('Imani', "Okay! Then why don't we visit the temple?")
('Imani', "Mother Jamileh knows a lot about stuff like that. I'm<br/>sure she'll be able to tell you lots!")
('Imani', 'See? I told you Mother Jamileh knew lots of stories!')
('Imani', "She always puts her all into telling them, too. That's<br/>what makes going to Sunday School so much fun!")
('Clim', "Yeah, I bet! She's really, really good. I'm so happy I<br/>got to hear new stories from her!")
('Clim', 'This temple is so amazing.')
('Clim', 'Even though we both pray to the same goddess,<br/>it looks and feels completely different from the<br/>chapel I go to!')
('Imani', "Wow, it's really that different? That's crazy!")
('Imani', "I'd love to hear what western ones are like. Could you<br/>tell me a little about them?")
('Imani', "This movie festival's totally unlike the festivals we<br/>usually have around here. It's great!")
('Imani', 'Are western festivals like this?')
('Clim', "No way! We don't have any festivals like this in my<br/>town, either!")
('Clim', 'My dad told me that this one is special and that an<br/>amazing guy called Salvatore Gotti came up with it!')
('Imani', "Oh, wow! I didn't know that!")
('Imani', "Umm, I don't know a lot about movies, actually.")
('Imani', 'Could you maybe tell me about western movies while<br/>we walk around? I wanna learn more!')
('Clim', 'Yeah, okay! There are movies about everything!<br/>They even make ones based on picture books!')
('Clim', "If I see them at the festival, I'll tell you!")
('Clim', 'My dad is all better now! Yippee! Now we can all<br/>enjoy the film festival!')
('Clim', "I'm gonna walk around and see what's going on with<br/>my new friend.")
('Clim', 'Once the film festival is over, I plan to give Imani this<br/>picture book I brought with me, just before I<br/>go home. I hope she likes it!')
('Clim', "Dad's been acting really weird since last night.<br/>He never yells like that...")
('Clim', "He must be tired. I'm sure he'll be back to<br/>normal soon.")
('Clim', "I'm not scared at all! The people in the temple are all<br/>so nice.")
('Clim', "I wanna teach Imani all about the fairy tales of where<br/>I'm from!")
('Clim', 'I know! Maybe I should give her my picture book that<br/>I brought with me!')
('Clim', "That's okay, isn't it? It'll be like a souvenir, but of me,<br/>since it's from my home! She won't even hafta travel<br/>for it!")
('Clim', "I've read a lot of picture books before.")
('Clim', "But the Central East has so many fairy tales I've never<br/>heard of!")
('Clim', "Imani knows a lot about them! I'm gonna ask the<br/>bishop lady to tell me some, too!")
('Ulrich', 'I really lost my mind yesterday. It was pathetic.<br/>All I did was make my family worry about me...')
('Ulrich', "I thought I'd enjoy a little of the unique local tobacco,<br/>but I guess that goes to show why you should always<br/>look before you leap.")
('Ulrich', "With all the trouble I caused my family, I need to<br/>make it up to them. So today, with the film festival,<br/>it's all about them.")
('Ulrich', "That includes looking after my son's new friend like<br/>any responsible parent should.")
('Ulrich', "GUAHAHAHA! I've been such a fool! A complete<br/>and utter moron! What have I been DOING with<br/>my life?!")
('Ulrich', 'Coming here and taking in the FESTIVE<br/>atmosphere has made me realize I was so stupid for<br/>letting myself be a cog in the corporate machine!')
('Ulrich', "Stupid manager and his bald head...<br/>Worthless coworkers... Everybody's always trying to<br/>make ME take responsibility for everything!")
('Ulrich', 'Screw this! Screw that! SCREW IT ALL! I should<br/>quit and try something new instead! Be my own boss<br/>for once in my miserable life!')
('Ulrich', "I never expected my son to be so taken with Central<br/>Eastern culture. It's great! I'm taking it as a sign that<br/>we should travel more often.")
('Ulrich', 'Speaking of Central Eastern culture, I knew about<br/>hookahs before coming here.')
('Ulrich', 'But I had no idea these orbal hookahs were a<br/>thing nowadays. Feels like they popped up out<br/>of nowhere.')
('Ulrich', "I'm glad my son's making friends with one of the<br/>local kids.")
('Ulrich', "Ever since I was sent out here to work, I've been<br/>looking for an opportunity to bring my family to<br/>Tharbad, too.")
('Ulrich', "I'd only planned to take him to the film festival and<br/>go sightseeing. It's a perfect stroke of luck that he's<br/>found a friend, too.")
('Ulrich', 'Who ever thought our son would be so interested in<br/>other cultures?')
('Ulrich', 'He told me he wants to have a lamp and a rug.')
('Ulrich', "We should probably just get him the lamp, don't<br/>you think? A rug's going to be a bit expensive.")
('Jasmine', "I don't know. Just because he wants a rug doesn't<br/>mean we all couldn't use it as a family. Why don't we<br/>buy a replica or something?")
('Jasmine', "Also, not to change the subject, but...honey, what's<br/>that thing you're smoking?")
('Ulrich', "Oh, this? It's a hookah. It's a traditional way of<br/>smoking tobacco in the Central East.")
('Ulrich', "This portable type you can carry around with you only<br/>came out recently. It's pretty handy.")
('Ulrich', "I know I've been trying to cut back on smoking, but I<br/>thought I should at least try this stuff since we're here.<br/>It can't hurt!")
('Jasmine', "My husband's back to his normal self. I'm just<br/>grateful that our son didn't get caught up in<br/>the commotion.")
('Jasmine', "But I still wonder what happened. The seller did<br/>apologize for those hookahs being 'unauthorized' or<br/>whatever it was. Was it really...?")
('Jasmine', "I have a lot of questions and concerns, still. But right<br/>now, I'm going to try to enjoy the film festival,<br/>especially while Imani's with us!")
('Jasmine', "I don't know what's going on with my husband.<br/>He's never been the best drinker, to be sure, but...")
('Jasmine', "He hasn't drunk anything today, and even when he<br/>gets drunk, he's never quite like, umm, this.")
('Jasmine', "The other people carrying on over there also look like<br/>they're extremely drunk, too. But I don't think I saw<br/>them drinking, either!")
('Jasmine', 'What in the world is going on here...?')
('Jasmine', "I appreciate my husband taking us all out on this trip,<br/>especially since it's given our son so many<br/>new experiences.")
('Jasmine', "I don't know if him smoking that hookah when he's<br/>not used to it is such a good idea, though. No matter<br/>how 'ambient' he says it is.")
('Jasmine', 'Are those hookahs really that good? I see an awful lot<br/>of people smoking them all over town. You have<br/>to wonder...')
('Jasmine', 'Seeing as the film festival is being held, too, I decided<br/>to take my husband up on his idea and come with our<br/>son on his business trip.')
('Jasmine', 'I figured it would be nice, but I never anticipated that<br/>our son would hit it off with one of the local<br/>children. What a wonderful surprise!')
('Jasmine', "I want him to grow up to be wise and broad-minded,<br/>so I'm glad he's getting exposed to other cultures<br/>while he's still young.")
('Maury', "Things have finally calmed down today. I'm still<br/>wondering what the heck was going on around here<br/>yesterday, though!")
('Maury', "Whatever it was, I'm glad it's over. I was starting to<br/>worry if that's what the Central East was always like.")
('Maury', "Now I can just enjoy the film festival without<br/>worrying about that, and start getting excited for the<br/>next trip I'm taking!")
('Maury', 'It might be the day before the film festival and all, but<br/>it feels like people are almost getting TOO excited<br/>for it, you know?')
('Maury', "I mean, I could tell people were excited yesterday,<br/>too, but today it's suddenly hit a fever pitch.")
('Maury', "Maybe I'm just overthinking things, but it just feels<br/>so abrupt. I don't know...")
('Maury', "It's amazing how good the hamam is at cleaning<br/>your skin and removing hair. I'd heard stories before,<br/>but hamaming is believing!")
('Maury', "I don't just feel like I look better—I can tell my blood<br/>flow has improved, too. I'm so nice and warm.<br/>I'm going to sleep like a log tonight!")
('Maury', "I should see if Altair has any hamams... Wait, no<br/>I shouldn't! That'll just ruin the surprise when I go<br/>there, if I know what to expect!")
('Maury', 'Traditional technology like this is so impressive.<br/>I remember being blown away by the löyly bath I took<br/>when I was in Remiferia, too.')
('Maury', "As hot as this place gets, it's still really nice. I like it!<br/>In fact, the heat makes it feel like I'm visiting a whole<br/>other planet.")
('Maury', 'I used to not wander far when I left home, but after<br/>visiting Creil and Remiferia, I now really get a kick<br/>out of traveling as far as I can.')
('Maury', 'Oh, yeah! I remember hearing that the sand at<br/>Mishelam Beach was shipped in from the<br/>Central East.')
('Maury', "Maybe if my plans work out, I'll go visit there<br/>sometime next month, and soak up some more sun.")
('Shahana', "There's still a lot of energy surrounding the film<br/>festival, but it feels nothing like the craziness that was<br/>happening yesterday.")
('Shahana', "Maybe the rumors I've been hearing about those<br/>confiscated orbal hookahs being the culprit really<br/>were true.")
('Shahana', 'Anyway, at least we all managed to make it to the<br/>festival in one piece. Now to go out and enjoy it while<br/>I can!')
('Shahana', 'Ugh... I ended up waking up early today because<br/>there was a commotion right in front of my home<br/>this morning.')
('Shahana', "This might be festival season, but I've never seen<br/>Tharbaders act so...wildly.")
('Shahana', "Sure, people get excited sometimes, but we're good<br/>about not causing trouble for other people. But now?<br/>It's bizarre.")
('Shahana', 'Even with the film festival right around the corner,<br/>the nights around here have gotten strangely loud<br/>and hectic.')
('Shahana', 'Unlike the Entertainment District, it used to be that<br/>when the sun went down, things really mellowed out<br/>in the Cultural District.')
('Shahana', "But lately, it's becoming more and more like the<br/>Entertainment District. It's all a little...concerning.")
('Shahana', "Now, what should I get for this week's groceries?<br/>Might be a good idea to be a bit sparing on<br/>the budget...")
('Shahana', 'People think everyone in Tharbad and Elsaim are<br/>rich, but as you can see, most of us are a lot<br/>more humble.')
('Shahana', "Not that we're not blessed here in many ways.<br/>Circumstances can definitely vary, depending on<br/>where you go in the Central East.")
('Shahana', 'This region has its conflicts. It sounds really tragic<br/>just how much Qadas has fallen in the wake of its<br/>development and all that.')
('Abdullah', "The young folk in these parts appear to have calmed<br/>down considerably. What could've happened to make<br/>them so mellow now?")
('Abdullah', "I don't see those wretched mechanical hookahs any<br/>longer, either. Ha! That'd certainly go a long way if<br/>they got rid of those terrible things.")
('Abdullah', "I suppose I can let bygones be bygones now that<br/>they've all learned to act human once again. Well, all<br/>save one, that is...")
('Abdullah', "I'm talking about that Salvatore Gotti's films!<br/>Gehenna will freeze before I ever have anything good<br/>to say about that man's filth!")
('Abdullah', 'Young people these days have no respect for law<br/>and order. I heard there was a big fight around here<br/>just this morning!')
('Abdullah', "If they hadn't drowned themselves in vice, forgetting<br/>their devotion to Arusha, this city wouldn't be the<br/>mess that it is today.")
('Abdullah', "Those 'motion pictures' are especially wretched.<br/>I tried to watch one of that Salvatore Gotti's things<br/>and was absolutely appalled!")
('Abdullah', "Such obscene trash is good for nothing but destroying<br/>people's morals! No wonder the young have lost<br/>their way!")
('Abdullah', "Bah, the scent of those newfangled<br/>mechanical hookahs! They've ruined the flavor of our<br/>own hookahs over here.")
('Abdullah', "What could these people possibly want, thinking they<br/>can come in with their weird devices, 'mechanizing'<br/>our culture?")
('Abdullah', "I'm going to need to have another talk with Father<br/>Mukhtar about the state of the world. Because I don't<br/>like where it's headed, that's for sure!")
('Abdullah', "Young people, I swear! They're all in a tizzy over this<br/>forsaken film festival! Doesn't anyone know<br/>self-restraint these days?!")
('Abdullah', "And it's not just the film festival that's wrong!<br/>So's that fountain in the Entertainment District!<br/>Back in my day, we treasured water!")
('Abdullah', "It's good to see the city thriving, but everybody seems<br/>to have forgotten they all have Arusha to thank for<br/>our prosperity! Hmph!")
('Zaham', 'Haha, now that the smell of those fake hookahs is<br/>gone, the real stuff tastes even better! Nothing beats<br/>tradition there.')
('Zaham', "In any case, I'm glad to see that the young folks have<br/>calmed down.")
('Zaham', 'Now I can simply sit back and enjoy all the<br/>excitement that the film festival has brought to<br/>the city.')
('Zaham', 'I do my best to try and respect what young folks try to<br/>do, but all of this mayhem is testing even<br/>my patience.')
('Zaham', "I understand everyone getting excited at being<br/>exposed to new ideas and culture, but that's no excuse<br/>for them to go act like hoodlums!")
('Zaham', "Either way, something about all this doesn't feel right<br/>to me. None of what's happening feels natural.<br/>Hmm...")
('Zaham', "I can sympathize with Abdullah's worries. Tharbad is<br/>changing so fast, it feels as though we hardly have<br/>time to even remember tradition.")
('Zaham', "Even so, we mustn't forget that we have Professor<br/>Hamilton and her incredible work to thank for our<br/>current fortune.")
('Zaham', "It would be disrespectful to everything she's done for<br/>our fair city to completely reject the Tharbad we<br/>have today.")
('Zaham', 'It might well be worthwhile for us to take a step back,<br/>like she did, and reconsider our position.')
('Zaham', "Oh, don't be like that, Abdullah. It's nice to see<br/>young people going out and enjoying new things.<br/>It brings a smile to MY face!")
('Zaham', 'Not to mention, if we cling to our ways too much, we<br/>as a people will have trouble getting along with those<br/>out west.')
('Zaham', "Though...those orbaled-up hookahs can go get buried<br/>in a dune, that I'll grant.")
('Pichcha', "This is where the parade's going to kick off later!")
('Pichcha', "I've been watching them put it all together, and it's<br/>really looking like it'll be out of this world!")
('Pichcha', "But I can't just stand here gawking at it! I'm going to<br/>try spying on their practice sessions to see what I can<br/>use to up my game!")
('Pichcha', 'I had some weirdo get, well, weird with me earlier.<br/>He was genuinely scary! His eyes looked so weird<br/>and bugged-out.')
('Pichcha', "Ugh, the first time I've gotten any real attention<br/>doing this and it had to turn out like that! Just<br/>my luck.")
('Pichcha', "I can only imagine how many times Saara and<br/>Shaheena must've had to deal with that. Arusha...")
('Pichcha', 'I heard Saara and Shaheena were ambushed by some<br/>awful guys this afternoon.')
('Pichcha', "That must've been so scary! I guess drawing a crowd<br/>isn't all fun and games when you get to be as popular<br/>as they are.")
('Pichcha', "*sigh* I think something must be missing in my<br/>practice routine. I don't know if it's enough to catch<br/>up to those two.")
('Pichcha', "You've seen them, right? The pair of sisters that<br/>dance over in front of the oasis.")
('Pichcha', "They're so good! I really look up to them. It's my goal<br/>to be just like them one day.")
('Jaret', "The film festival's as bustling as you'd expect. It feels<br/>like night and day compared to how things<br/>were yesterday.")
('Jaret', "Mind you, we still did good business even during all<br/>that weirdness. We weren't hurting for mira, that's<br/>for sure.")
('Jaret', "Still, whatever happened, I'm glad it's behind us.<br/>I feel a lot more comfortable selling my meat when<br/>the city feels alive like this.")
('Jaret', 'My supplier was weirdly riled up when he came to<br/>drop off some stock earlier.')
('Jaret', 'It was hard even carrying a conversation with him.<br/>He was fired up, but speaking incoherently at the<br/>same time. Bizarre.')
('Jaret', "He's not the only one who's been acting off, either.<br/>The tourists and some other residents are being<br/>odd, too.")
('Jaret', "It could just be because of the festival coming up.<br/>But...it's giving me the creeps, somehow.<br/>Doesn't seem right.")
('Jaret', 'Looking for something for dinner? How about some<br/>camel meat? They say it pairs well with a<br/>nice libation!')
('Jaret', 'Here in the Central East, families often come<br/>together to eat camel on holidays and the like.')
('Jaret', 'You might find yourself craving some alcohol at those<br/>gatherings, but our customs strictly forbid drinking at<br/>those times.')
('Jaret', "Well, well, well. Can't say I see groups of tourists that<br/>look like you all very often. Color me intrigued!")
('Jaret', 'The little lady there must be Central Eastern,<br/>too, right? But judging from her apparel...from the<br/>mountains, am I right?')
('Jaret', 'Which means none of you probably have much<br/>experience eating camel.')
('Jaret', 'If you ask me, I think you should change that!<br/>Why not have some of my camel meat?<br/>Nobody comes away unsatisfied, and I mean nobody!')
('Jaret', 'I specialize in camel meat-based dishes here, which<br/>are an ordinary part of Central Eastern cuisine.')
('Jaret', "That might surprise you to hear, since many think of<br/>them as beasts of burden, but they're eaten pretty<br/>regularly, as a matter of fact.")
('Jaret', "They're a valuable source of protein, in particular, in<br/>our corner of Zemuria, where grazing land isn't<br/>exactly found over every hill.")
('Balsheh', "The city feels a little...different from how it<br/>was yesterday. There's a much more positive energy in<br/>the air.")
('Balsheh', "I guess we have the film festival to thank for that.<br/>I think I'll stay around and soak in the atmosphere.")
('Balsheh', "I don't know very much at all about motion pictures,<br/>but it's a good opportunity to learn more about what<br/>young people think these days.")
('Balsheh', 'The energy here is...simply incredible. Are all film<br/>festivals so joyous?')
('Balsheh', 'It scares me how many people are so...unrestrained.<br/>But I must admit, my curiosity is now piqued.')
('Balsheh', "Plus it's a chance to hopefully learn a little more about<br/>younger folks. I don't want to toss that away!")
('Balsheh', "I heard that some ne'er-do-wells gave those poor,<br/>poor dancers quite a bit of trouble.")
('Balsheh', "It's such a shame. In my day, travelers who came here<br/>were considerate towards us. But these days...")
('Balsheh', "I worry that our way of life here is in danger.<br/>It troubles me, greatly. There's nothing quite like our<br/>Cultural District, here in Tharbad.")
('Balsheh', 'Hello there. Interested in some Central<br/>Eastern antiques?')
('Balsheh', 'Everybody in these parts really values history, which is<br/>good when you trade in artifacts like I do.')
('Balsheh', 'For as much as the Entertainment District has<br/>changed, the Cultural District is still humming along,<br/>same as ever. Business is good.')
('Balsheh', "The fact this part of town still looks the way it does is<br/>all thanks to how much people around here<br/>cherish history. It's wonderful.")
('Monir', "If you're interested in those black pomegranates, you<br/>should talk to Philica. She runs a stall over in the<br/>Entertainment District.")
('Monir', "If you explain your situation to her, maybe she'll be<br/>willing to help. Only one way to find out, right?")
('Monir', "Things are as bustling as ever over here, but somehow<br/>it all feels a little...different compared to yesterday.<br/>It's tough to explain.")
('Monir', "The parents of my daughter's new friend, the ones<br/>from out of town, came to say hello. They seem like<br/>incredibly nice people.")
('Monir', "They're taking her to the film festival, which<br/>I appreciate. I'm too busy with work to go, and was<br/>apprehensive about letting her go alone.")
('Monir', 'I really appreciate the temple agreeing to look after<br/>my daughter for a little while.')
('Monir', "With all of these people coming in and the bazaar<br/>getting so busy, I'd be worried about her getting lost.<br/>This way, I know she's safe.")
('Monir', "Plus that new friend she made yesterday is there, too.<br/>That'll help keep her occupied.")
('Monir', "The film festival's great for business. With all these<br/>tourists coming to town, my sales have<br/>nearly doubled!")
('Monir', "I'm a little concerned I'm going to run low on some<br/>of my stock. But that's not the worst problem to have,<br/>when I can put so much money away.")
('Monir', "Plus my daughter is so curious about Western culture.<br/>I want to take her traveling one of these days, so it'll<br/>help me save for that, too.")
('Monir', "Got an appetite for some Central Eastern fruits or<br/>spices, by any chance? You won't find my goods<br/>anywhere else in Calvard!")
('Monir', "Western nobles have loved our spices for generations.<br/>That's the reason trade first took off between<br/>our cultures!")
('Monir', "You should really give them a try. Once you do, you'll<br/>wonder how you ever lived without them!")
('Monir', 'It looks like my daughter, Imani, has made friends<br/>with a child visiting from out of town.')
('Monir', "I've had the pleasure of doing some cultural exchanges<br/>for my business, but to see her do that with just a<br/>picture book is...really special.")
('Monir', "Honestly, it's wonderful to see people embrace our<br/>culture and find themselves captivated by it.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "I'll be honest, it's a little tough handing over the reins<br/>to Shaheena for the parade, even if Mr. Gotti and<br/>Prince Sherid are okay with it.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "And it's a really big responsibility for her.<br/>Between you and me, I'm a little anxious, to say<br/>the least.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "But...after watching her practice, I know she's got<br/>what it takes. If someone has to take over for me, I'm<br/>glad it's her! She's going to be great!")
('Shaheena', "You guys have nothing to worry about! I'll shine just<br/>as bright in that parade as my sister can!")
('Shaheena', "It's easy for me to forget, sometimes, but I know just<br/>how much Saara has struggled to make sure we make<br/>ends meet.")
('Shaheena', "So getting on that float is the least I can do to pay<br/>her back! I'm gonna dance so hard, it'll be an even<br/>better show than she'd put on!")
('Proprietress Hala', "Rahmani's back to his usual self now, which I'm glad<br/>to see. What do you think was going on earlier?<br/>That was so odd.")
('Proprietress Hala', "You know, I feel like I haven't seen any of those orbal<br/>hookahs today. Wait... They couldn't have been<br/>behind it, could they?")
('Proprietress Hala', "Well, whatever it was, I can stop worrying about<br/>what's going on out there and get back to focusing<br/>on my business now.")
('Proprietress Hala', "The real festival's going to be kicking off soon. I bet<br/>all the bars tonight are going to be more alive than<br/>they've ever felt!")
('Proprietress Hala', "I've known Rahmani a good while now, and I like to<br/>think I understand him pretty well.")
('Proprietress Hala', "But I've never seen the man in such high spirits.<br/>He hasn't even had anything to drink!")
('Proprietress Hala', "I've heard that there's been even more commotion<br/>than usual over at the bazaar, too.")
('Proprietress Hala', "It's all getting to be concerning. Our guests can't<br/>exactly enjoy their stay here if there's too much of a<br/>ruckus outside, you know?")
('Proprietress Hala', 'On behalf of the hamam owner, I just wanted to<br/>thank you all again for helping out with that.')
('Proprietress Hala', "It's amazing just how much we can all accomplish<br/>when we come together to solve a problem like that.")
('Proprietress Hala', "Also, I'm glad we had an extra bed to spare for that<br/>lovely new lady you've added to your ranks.")
('Proprietress Hala', 'I hate having to put her in that shared room, but all<br/>of our other rooms are full. You got really lucky with<br/>your reservation, there.')
('Proprietress Hala', "Now that our son's getting older, I feel it's time for<br/>him to start getting ready to take over the inn in<br/>the future.")
('Proprietress Hala', "I'm trying to set him up with a nice girl so he'll settle<br/>down, but he's completely glum about the whole idea.<br/>Puts me in a bit of a spot.")
('Proprietress Hala', "I wish he had more confidence in himself. He's a<br/>perfectly capable young man who's got his<br/>act together. What isn't there to like?")
('Proprietress Hala', "I hate to impose when you're all supposed to be<br/>guests, but we appreciate you taking a look at<br/>the hamam.")
('Proprietress Hala', "I really hope we can all find a way to fix it. It's not<br/>exactly good for business if those baths are out of<br/>commission, you know.")
('Proprietress Hala', "What a surprise this is! I didn't expect to see you<br/>again without the rest of your clan, Feri.")
('Proprietress Hala', 'I remember the last time you stayed here, you said<br/>you wanted to get out and see more of the world.<br/>Have you gotten to do that?')
('Feri', "Yeah! Van's taught me so much.")
('Feri', "The only problem is, the more I learn, the more I<br/>realize just how big Zemuria is! That makes me<br/>wanna see even more of what's out there!")
('Proprietress Hala', "Sounds like a good problem to me! Now that you're<br/>on this new path, it's only natural to keep wanting to<br/>learn more and more.")
('Proprietress Hala', "And if I had to guess, the real adventure has only just<br/>begun for you. There's a lot more for you to discover<br/>out there.")
('Proprietress Hala', "If you have time, either tonight or later, I'd love to<br/>hear all about what you've seen so far. Sound good?")
('Feri', "Okay! I can't wait to talk about it all with you,<br/>Ms. Hala!")
('Proprietress Hala', 'This inn has always played host to all kinds of folk.<br/>It comes with Tharbad sitting near the border.')
('Proprietress Hala', 'Take that trader over there. He stays with us<br/>every month.')
('Proprietress Hala', "Feri's clan are consistent regulars, too. I lost track of<br/>how many times they stayed with us throughout<br/>last year!")
('Khosrow', 'Despite today being the film festival, everyone—our<br/>guests, the merchants, other tourists—has mellowed<br/>out a bit, it feels like.')
('Khosrow', "What do you think was going on?<br/>Thankfully nothing ended up happening here in the<br/>inn, but I still can't help but wonder.")
('Khosrow', "Ah, well. The festival's starting, which means more<br/>guests for us. As my mother always says, it's time to<br/>get cracking and work, work, work!")
('Khosrow', "The festival might be tomorrow, but is it worth<br/>getting THIS excited for? It feels like everyone's<br/>going nuts.")
('Khosrow', 'Some of the neighbors seem like completely different<br/>people, all full of energy and practically bouncing off<br/>the walls!')
('Khosrow', "I'm really worried this is all going to cause trouble for<br/>the inn, somehow.")
('Khosrow', "For the sake of our guests, I hope things settle down<br/>sooner rather than later. I don't want all this getting<br/>in the way of their comfort.")
('Khosrow', 'Thanks for fixing the problem over at the hamam<br/>down the street. You guys have been a big help<br/>around here.')
('Khosrow', "If only Mom would take a page out of your book.<br/>Instead of doing something worthwhile with her<br/>time, she's just been playing cupid all year...")
('Khosrow', "She wants me to hurry up and settle down for 'the<br/>future of the inn.' But I'm just not ready to take over.<br/>And I'm not being humble!")
('Khosrow', 'My mother is really intent on me settling down and<br/>starting a family.')
('Khosrow', 'One time, I just happened to say how pretty one of<br/>the dancing sisters was and then she went out and<br/>tried to find a girl like her.')
('Khosrow', "If you're wondering why she didn't introduce us, it's<br/>because she 'couldn't possibly picture us being a good<br/>fit,' which... *sigh*")
('Khosrow', "Hey, I remember you! You were with those jaegers<br/>that stayed with us last year, weren't you? Looks like<br/>you've been doing well.")
('Khosrow', "If I remember, you really enjoyed our kofta,<br/>didn't you?")
('Khosrow', "I'll be sure to get some for you while you're here.")
('Feri', 'Wow, thanks, Khosrow!')
('Feri', "I can't believe you remembered what I like to eat!<br/>You really are as good as your mom says.")
('Feri', "Everybody in my clan was saying you're gonna be an<br/>amazing owner once you take over!")
('Khosrow', "Haha, it's no big deal. Your clan is just one of the<br/>more...distinct guests we've had, so your preferences<br/>came back to me pretty easily.")
('Khosrow', "Trust me, I've got a long way to go before I'll be ready<br/>to run the inn.")
('Khosrow', "Though that hasn't stopped my mother from trying to<br/>jump the gun and get things moving... *sigh*")
('Feri', 'Things? What kind of things?')
('Khosrow', "Oh, it's nothing. You don't need to worry about it.<br/>She'll forget about it and move on soon enough.<br/>I hope.")
('Khosrow', "My mother has really high hopes for me as the future<br/>owner of the inn, even if I think I still have a LOT to<br/>learn before I'll be ready.")
('Khosrow', "But hearing that everyone in the Kruga appreciates<br/>my work does give me a little more confidence.<br/>I'll keep trying to make everyone proud.")
('Rahmani', "What happened to me yesterday...? My memory's<br/>pretty fuzzy, but I guess I had Hala and her family<br/>pretty worried for a bit there.")
('Rahmani', "It's not like anything could've changed overnight.<br/>But why do things feel so different all of a sudden?")
('Rahmani', "If I had to guess, maybe it's got something to do with<br/>the festival starting and those orbal hookahs<br/>disappearing from stores. Who knows?")
('Rahmani', "Gahaha, I'm telling you, Tharbad's booming bigger<br/>than ever right now!")
('Rahmani', "I've got to get in on this while the getting's good and<br/>stock up on everything I can possibly get my<br/>hands on!")
('Rahmani', "Who cares if I go a little in the red right now?<br/>It'll work out! I can just tell I'll be able to recoup<br/>everything and then some! No prob!")
('Rahmani', "There's another trader I know who lost his camel.<br/>It sounded like a real nightmare.")
('Rahmani', "I've got to be careful so the same thing doesn't<br/>happen to me... Eh, cross that bridge if I come to it.<br/>For now, I'm taking a break.")
('Rahmani', 'You only live once. I bought one of those orbal<br/>hookahs that are so big right now. Might as well give<br/>it a whirl, right?')
('Rahmani', "Hmm... So this is what it tastes like. It's got its<br/>quirks, but it's not bad for what it is.")
('Rahmani', 'Stings my nose a little, but it sure wakes you up.')
('Rahmani', "The fact I can smoke this while riding my camel or in<br/>the car is a real lifesaver as a traveling salesman, I'll<br/>tell you what.")
('Rahmani', 'Coming to this inn always relaxes me.<br/>The proprietress and I are pretty friendly, so she<br/>understands what I always like and need.')
('Rahmani', "Plus it's easy to park your camels outside. Stuff like<br/>that is what makes old inns a godsend to traders<br/>like me.")
('Rahmani', "Once I give Hala my little gift from home I brought<br/>with me, it'll be time to start talking business.")
('Rahmani', 'With all the places still lacking paved roads, even<br/>these days, there continues to be a place for traders<br/>like me who go around on camel.')
('Rahmani', "Those orbal hookahs I've been seeing must be<br/>REALLY new. I didn't see anything like them when<br/>I was in the city just last month.")
('Rahmani', 'I might have to get one and try it out. They look like<br/>something you could smoke even while on camelback,<br/>not just when you need a break.')
('Vicar Mukhtar', "The film festival is now upon us. After yesterday's<br/>disturbances, I still have my worries, but ultimately,<br/>it's a day I welcome.")
('Vicar Mukhtar', "After all, such cultural exchanges have fostered<br/>mutual understanding between people and long<br/>contributed greatly to Tharbad's development.")
('Vicar Mukhtar', "It is true that some people here worry about the<br/>festival's effects on our culture and ways of living.<br/>Nobody can deny that.")
('Vicar Mukhtar', "It's our place as the temple to recognize those<br/>concerns and the communal balance, and address<br/>those things in a responsible manner.")
('Vicar Mukhtar', 'Despite Tharbad being a lively entertainment<br/>destination for decades now, never in all my time<br/>have I seen such a tumult in the city.')
('Vicar Mukhtar', "Many residents are understandably concerned about<br/>what's going on. I pray all this doesn't lead to any<br/>greater conflicts.")
('Vicar Mukhtar', "It's during times such as these that we must spread<br/>the spirit of tolerance and understanding that have<br/>served us so well.")
('Vicar Mukhtar', 'Once the festival is over, I hope to be able to sit down<br/>with our politicians and business leaders to discuss the<br/>future of our city.')
('Vicar Mukhtar', "Our Cultural District isn't some sort of<br/>museum exhibit. It's home to many people, a place<br/>whose ways of living are precious to them.")
('Vicar Mukhtar', 'Figuring out how to preserve and uphold those<br/>traditions while embracing modernization is always a<br/>constant balancing act we must deal with.')
('Vicar Mukhtar', "This temple does its best to respond to people's<br/>concerns, and we therefore serve as something of a<br/>representative of the community.")
('Vicar Mukhtar', 'Central Eastern temples are institutions of tolerance,<br/>at heart. We always strive to promote mutual<br/>understanding among one another.')
('Vicar Mukhtar', "Tharbad used to be a trading hub, first and foremost.<br/>But in the past two decades, it's rapidly developed<br/>into a city for recreation.")
('Vicar Mukhtar', 'As a result, there are naturally a number of citizens<br/>who feel concerned that Tharbad is losing sight of its<br/>original culture.')
('Vicar Mukhtar', 'I do my best to take their thoughts and feelings into<br/>consideration in talking to people so that, together,<br/>we can make Tharbad even better.')
('Vicar Mukhtar', 'Welcome, everyone. This is a place of worship for<br/>Arusha, the Winged Goddess.')
('Vicar Mukhtar', 'Many tourists these days wander into our temple out<br/>of curiosity. I hope your visit today offers some<br/>insight into our culture.')
('Vicar Mukhtar', 'As a scholar of Septian law, I spare no effort when it<br/>comes to spreading knowledge of the Testaments to<br/>the people.')
('Vicar Mukhtar', "In the harsh deserts of the Central East, we all help<br/>one another, so it's only natural for people to share<br/>their beliefs in the spirit of tolerance.")
('Vicar Mukhtar', 'That spirit matters more than ever as contact with the<br/>western lands increases and our daily lives here<br/>continue to change and evolve.')
('Vicar Mukhtar', "I'm confident that the knowledge and teachings we<br/>have come to embrace here will prove helpful to<br/>westerners such as yourselves as well.")
('Priest Jamileh', "The trouble from yesterday seems to have died down,<br/>so I've told the children it's okay to go outside,<br/>especially since it's festival day.")
('Priest Jamileh', 'That said, with all these crowds around, they should<br/>still only walk around the festival if they have a<br/>guardian accompanying them.')
('Priest Jamileh', "Still, the film festival is a wonderful opportunity<br/>for them. It's important for them to get to have all<br/>sorts of experiences.")
('Priest Jamileh', "I just had a talk with Father Mukhtar about how we<br/>should keep the children safe, seeing as there's so<br/>much trouble today.")
('Priest Jamileh', "It could be really dangerous if any of them get lost out<br/>there, which is why I'm telling them they shouldn't<br/>walk by themselves.")
('Priest Jamileh', "For those parents who are too busy to look after them<br/>today, we're also happy to take their children in and<br/>look after them, if need be.")
('Priest Jamileh', "It makes me so happy to see little Clim take an<br/>interest in our folklore. It's been a pleasure to teach<br/>him about it.")
('Priest Jamileh', 'Some of our congregants have expressed concern<br/>that people are beginning to forget the moral<br/>teachings behind such stories.')
('Priest Jamileh', 'But all you need see is a child listening and enjoying<br/>those stories innocently to know that hope is by no<br/>means lost.')
('Priest Jamileh', "Welcome to our temple. Truth be told, we've had<br/>some rather temperamental tourists cross our<br/>doors recently.")
('Priest Jamileh', 'However, I can tell that none of you are here to cause<br/>trouble, and am more than happy to have you here.')
('Priest Jamileh', "Central Eastern temples are meant to be places of<br/>tolerance, which is why we've always opened our<br/>doors in the spirit of understanding.")
('Priest Jamileh', "Unfortunately, we've recently been seeing so many<br/>unruly tourists here. When things get too out of<br/>hand, sadly, I do ask them to leave.")
('Priest Jamileh', "Would you all happen to be interested in the Central<br/>East's unique folklore, by any chance? It's quite a rich<br/>storytelling tradition.")
('Priest Jamileh', 'I teach those stories to the local children during<br/>Sunday School, but I think they have plenty to offer<br/>for visitors from other regions.')
('Priest Jamileh', 'Sadly, not many children from outside of Tharbad<br/>show much interest in learning about them, which is<br/>a shame.')
('Fet', 'I have to wonder what all that crazy fervor going on<br/>earlier was.')
('Fet', 'It must not have had anything to do with the festival<br/>itself, because things are definitely calmer than they<br/>were yesterday.')
('Fet', "I guess I shouldn't have jumped to conclusions and<br/>pinned the blame on the festival, but...the whole<br/>thing is still very odd.")
('Fet', "Everybody's getting all worked up about the festival,<br/>but I don't get what all the excitement's about.")
('Fet', "Could it really be all that great? Maybe it's just<br/>because I don't really know all that much about films.<br/>It's hard to say.")
('Fet', "I've kept my distance from them up until now, but<br/>maybe I should try watching one and see if I can<br/>figure anything out.")
('Fet', "Ugh, tourists these days have no respect for what<br/>they're visiting.")
('Fet', "Tharbad isn't just some theme park that exists for<br/>their enjoyment! It's a place where people live, and<br/>they want to live here in peace.")
('Fet', "Don't get me wrong. I'm happy to see that kid take<br/>an interest in our culture! I just wish more people<br/>were like him. *sigh*")
('Fet', 'To be fair, I think there are lots of local people my<br/>age that have been drawn in by all the glitz and<br/>glamor of the Entertainment District.')
('Fet', "But deep down, I think a lot of them still value our<br/>traditions and culture, even if they won't say it<br/>out loud.")
('Fet', 'I know that because they all still come down here to<br/>the temple on holidays and pray with the elders.')
('Fet', "That's why I think this place is so important and I'm<br/>glad to have it. It's preserving those traditional values<br/>so they don't get lost.")
('Manager Jahm', "Heading into the hamam? Admission's on<br/>the house. Least I can do for saving my<br/>whole business.")
('Manager Jahm', "I... I can't believe His Highness would grace our<br/>humble hamam with his presence!")
('Manager Jahm', "I heard he was an affable guy, and he is. But it's hard<br/>not to get nervous serving someone with such a high<br/>profile, you know?")
('Manager Jahm', "I've got to make sure everything's running perfectly<br/>so he enjoys his visit! Can't have anything embarrassing<br/>happen while he's here!")
('Manager Jahm', 'Compared to yesterday, our customers seem a lot<br/>more calm now. Really, the whole city is. What was<br/>going on before, I wonder?')
('Manager Jahm', "I haven't seen those orbal hookahs, either. I heard<br/>they were laced with something and that was the<br/>cause of all that chaos.")
('Manager Jahm', "Anyway, if that's the case, why not take a break here?<br/>Flush out all that bad stuff by working up a<br/>little sweat!")
('Manager Jahm', "I've never seen this much excitement in the city, even<br/>after it started taking off 20 years ago. The hamam<br/>never has this many customers!")
('Manager Jahm', "It's not all fun and games, though. I've heard a lot of<br/>tourists are letting their hair down a bit TOO much<br/>and going off the rails.")
('Manager Jahm', "We're definitely having to keep a close eye to make<br/>sure nobody tries to peep on others or steal things<br/>from the changing rooms.")
('Manager Jahm', 'Thanks for getting the water back and running<br/>again, everyone. Feel free to relax here as long as you<br/>all like.')
('Manager Jahm', 'In fact, I know you only asked for one free bath, but<br/>you can use these facilities as much as you like.<br/>I heard how much trouble it was!')
('Manager Jahm', "It's become easy to take our water for granted<br/>nowadays, even though we're in the middle of<br/>a desert.")
('Manager Jahm', 'But before the professor and the Verne Company<br/>came through with the waterworks project,<br/>sometimes we went bone dry out here.')
('Manager Jahm', "We've been blessed with so much water for 20 years, I<br/>was beginning to forget what a miracle that whole<br/>system really is.")
('Manager Jahm', "I'm sorry to trouble you, but if you could get<br/>to the bottom of this and get the water flowing<br/>again, I'd really appreciate it.")
('Manager Jahm', "I can't tell you just how important the hamam is,<br/>not just to us, of course, but to everyone living in the<br/>Cultural District.")
('Judith', 'It was nice of the prince to invite us here. Finally got<br/>to take a load off my shoulders for a little bit.')
('Judith', "We're all ready for the parade on our end. So until<br/>things kick off, I'm going to take it nice and slow.<br/>Save my stamina for what's to come.")
('Nina', "It's so important to relax when you can. That soak in<br/>the baths really helped me soothe my mind and body.")
('Nina', "I just hope that Shaheena's not too nervous going<br/>into this parade. It's a lot to have foisted onto her all<br/>of a sudden...")
('Nina', "No, I have to believe in her. In fact, I do! Judith and I<br/>both know she can do it. Everything's going to be<br/>just fine!")
('Prince Sherid', 'That was quite the intense match we had in there!<br/>Such moments like that are why I love bathhouses<br/>such as this.')
('Prince Sherid', 'Being among your peers in the buff, and competing<br/>like that, you learn a lot about each other as men.')
('Aaron', 'Oh, I learned a lot about you two, all right.<br/>Especially just how much the old fart here is getting<br/>on in years.')
('Van', "Yeah, yeah, laugh it up. Just remember, we're only<br/>five years apart. You'll be right in my shoes before you<br/>know it.")
('Agnès', 'Do I even want to know what you three got up to<br/>in there?')
('Risette', 'Whatever was going on, we could certainly hear your<br/>voices on the other side and it all sounded<br/>rather...colorful.')
('Prince Sherid', 'Haha! Forgive our tomfoolery. That said, your whole<br/>group seems rather jovial, Van, even more than I<br/>initially surmised.')
('Prince Sherid', "Once these festivities are over, and the case is truly<br/>behind us, I'd love to do this again. Not for business,<br/>purely for pleasure.")
('Van', "Glad you enjoyed our company, Your Highness.<br/>Means a lot, comin' from a man of your stature.")
('Van', "But if we're gonna have any more competitions, can it<br/>wait until I've trained up a little? I don't wanna lose to<br/>this punkass again.")
('Aaron', "Somebody's a sore loser, huh? Accept your fate<br/>already, old fart. Your time has come...<br/>and goooooone.")
('Prince Sherid', "Hahaha! Very well! I'll hold off on any more<br/>competitions until I've trained as well. But it is in the<br/>cards now! Remember that!")
('Prince Sherid', "Now that I've worked up a decent sweat in those<br/>baths, it's time to turn my attention back towards the<br/>film festival in earnest.")
('Prince Sherid', "I am here on behalf of my father, after all. It's my<br/>responsibility to see this event through, especially in<br/>light of what's transpired.")
('Prince Sherid', "Luckily, my head feels so clear now that I'm<br/>confident I can give my speech completely off<br/>the cuff. I won't need any script to back me up.")
('Naje', "*sigh* We could hear His Highness loud and clear, all<br/>the way on the women's side.")
('Naje', 'You can, and should, tell the prince off when he starts<br/>to get out of hand in such situations as that. You have<br/>my permission, in fact.')
('Naje', 'Doing so will not offend the royal family. If anything,<br/>he could stand to be more disciplined, like the prince<br/>of Erebonia is said to be.')
('Van', "I know it's not gonna mean much comin' from me<br/>after all that, but...you never catch a break, do you?<br/>Must be hard, lookin' after him.")
('Naje', "Oh, no. It's all part of my job as his bodyguard.<br/>If anything, I consider it an honor to be able to serve<br/>someone as unique as His Highness.")
('Van', 'If you say so. Still looks like a tough job to me.')
('Feri', 'You know, Naje was pretty quiet while we were all in<br/>the baths together.')
('Feri', "But she looked amazing! Holy smokes! Her<br/>body's unbelievable!")
('Aaron', "Oh, yeah? You're telling me there's more than meets<br/>the eye underneath that trim suit of hers?")
('Aaron', "'Cause now that you mention it, I can certainly<br/>believe it.")
('Risette', 'Indeed. I myself was quite impressed with her<br/>musculature, seeing it up close.')
('Risette', 'You would not know it otherwise, but she clearly<br/>maintains an extensive routine. She was taut as a<br/>bow-string, with no slack at any point.')
('Naje', "I stay on top of my royal swordfighting training,<br/>that's why.")
('Naje', "I've never given much thought to my appearance.<br/>But it is a nice testament to my training to be<br/>complimented for the resulting physique.")
('Aaron', "That's...one way to look at it, I guess.")
('Naje', "Now that the prince has had his fun and appears<br/>satisfied, it's time we return our focus to the task<br/>at hand.")
('Naje', 'As representative of the principality, His Highness<br/>has spent much time and effort trying to get to the<br/>bottom of all of these...mishaps.')
('Naje', "I pray the event goes as planned and his work<br/>is rewarded. I know how much he's personally<br/>looking forward to it. But we'll see.")
('Fie', 'You boys sure got noisy over there. Whatever you<br/>three were doing, you sounded pretty into it.')
('Fie', "Heh, not that I'm one to criticize. I've gotten up to<br/>my fair share of trouble like that before. I know how<br/>it goes.")
('Van', "Yeah, I can imagine, knowin' the kind of company<br/>you've kept over the years.")
('Feri', 'We had a nice time! I got to hear all kinds of stories<br/>from her about what Aida was like, back in the day!')
('Feri', "And she has so many interesting thoughts on jaegers,<br/>now that she's a bracer these days, too! I love talking<br/>to her!")
('Fie', "I didn't think what I had to share was THAT<br/>interesting, but I appreciate it.")
('Fie', "If my experiences can help you, then I'm content.")
('Aaron', '(Damn. Were you girls talking about heavy shit that<br/>entire time while our dumb asses were<br/>horsing around?)')
('Risette', '(Not entirely. I would say that the latter half of our<br/>time spent in the baths was spent discussing more...<br/>typical concerns of young ladies.)')
('Agnès', "(RISETTE! Don't say it like that! You're going to<br/>give Aaron weird thoughts!)")
('Fie', "Anyway, I'm glad I finally had a chance to sit down<br/>and spend some time talking to Feri.")
('Fie', 'It was...a good reminder that we all owe it to Aida,<br/>too, to confront Almata.')
('Receptionist Jibril', "I heard you all helped out with that whole Vegas<br/>Films mess. Thank you. It seems you're more<br/>trustworthy than I gave you credit for.")
('Receptionist Jibril', "From what Fie has told me, you're all really capable.<br/>Even more than we were originally expecting, to<br/>be honest.")
('Receptionist Jibril', "Just because those orbal hookahs have been<br/>confiscated doesn't mean we can breathe a sigh of<br/>relief and take it easy now.")
('Receptionist Jibril', "Almata almost certainly still has their eye on<br/>something else. We'll have to be on high alert, all<br/>throughout the festival.")
('Receptionist Jibril', "We've been getting reports of fighting and sudden<br/>disturbances all day. The police have their hands full<br/>trying to respond to everything.")
('Receptionist Jibril', 'Apparently, according to two people I talked to who<br/>dealt with a similar case, this is completely identical<br/>to another case.')
('Receptionist Jibril', 'There must be some mutual connection behind<br/>both incidents. Hmm...')
('Receptionist Jibril', 'Once she gets here from the main branch, we should<br/>probably step up our investigation.')
('Receptionist Jibril', 'The fact we have limited room to navigate these<br/>cases unless a civilian is directly harmed does<br/>make things more difficult.')
('Receptionist Jibril', "We're trying to investigate what's going on in<br/>Tharbad's shadows right now.")
('Receptionist Jibril', "Unfortunately, we can only take it so far by ourselves.<br/>We'll probably need to coordinate with the police to<br/>some extent to get anywhere.")
('Receptionist Jibril', "Which is to say, if you all find anything, please, don't<br/>keep it to yourselves. The more we work together, the<br/>better this will all end.")
('Receptionist Jibril', 'I hope you all are able to figure out who that<br/>mysterious green-haired bracer is by tomorrow.')
('Receptionist Jibril', "If not, we'll probably have to open an investigation<br/>ourselves so we can get the victim his wallet back.<br/>We can't keep him waiting too long.")
('Receptionist Jibril', 'You all did a great job getting the situation under<br/>control before the damage got too severe. We really<br/>appreciate it.')
('Receptionist Jibril', "I guess your nose for these things really is as strong as<br/>everybody says. I'll be taking a few pages out of your<br/>book from now on.")
('Receptionist Jibril', "Huh, I don't remember seeing that woman with you<br/>the last time we spoke.")
('Receptionist Jibril', "...Judging by her outfit, I think I have a pretty good<br/>idea of what she's doing here and what her<br/>position is.")
('Receptionist Jibril', 'You might not think it, but we do have some insight<br/>into ongoing trends within Central Eastern finance.')
('Receptionist Jibril', 'Oh, are you guys from Arkride Solutions? The ones<br/>those 4SPGs are supposed to be for?')
('Receptionist Jibril', "I've been hearing a lot of talk about you guys since<br/>you came into town.")
('Van', 'You have, huh? Guess word travels pretty fast in<br/>these parts.')
('Receptionist Jibril', "It does, although the main branch told me about you<br/>all, as well, so I'm a little familiar with you already.")
('Receptionist Jibril', 'Including what you guys got up to over in Langport.<br/>Apparently you were even more capable<br/>than expected.')
('Aaron', "Well, would you look at that? Sounds like the guild's<br/>giving us some props. About time, if you ask me!")
('Van', "Yeah, but that also means we now got a reputation to<br/>maintain with these people, especially in light of<br/>what's going on.")
('Van', "Not that we mind taking a load off the guild—ain't the<br/>first time. But don't expect us to take everything.<br/>We still reserve the right to decide.")
('Receptionist Jibril', "I understand. We appreciate you being so up front<br/>about it. Don't worry, we'll be careful in what we<br/>choose to pass on to you.")
('Receptionist Jibril', 'We simply appreciate your ability to handle some of<br/>our load and delegate responsibilities among<br/>yourselves as needed.')
('Receptionist Jibril', 'As you can imagine, we have more on our plate than<br/>simply providing security for the festival and sorting<br/>out any tourist problems.')
('Van', '(Hmm... Sounds like the guild could be investigating<br/>something on their end, too.)')
('Van', "(All the more reason to help 'em out, then. Not only<br/>will they owe us a favor or two, we might be able to<br/>get some intel out of 'em.)")
('Receptionist Jibril', "I'm sure you've sensed it yourselves, but Tharbad is in<br/>somewhat of a peculiar position.")
('Receptionist Jibril', "More and more issues are cropping up, and while<br/>we're not sure why yet, we do know that it's not just<br/>because of the film festival.")
('Receptionist Jibril', "I won't intrude into whatever business has brought<br/>you here. But you should be aware that we do have an<br/>investigation underway.")
('Receptionist Jibril', "So if you could bear in mind the complexity of the<br/>situation before making any moves, we'd<br/>appreciate it.")
('Bracer Renton', "We might've gotten the trouble sorted out at the<br/>bazaar, but something about it all still doesn't sit right<br/>with me.")
('Bracer Renton', "I've heard Tharbad's seeing more and more tourists<br/>who are getting out of hand, like what those dancers<br/>had to deal with.")
('Bracer Renton', "Hmm... I think tomorrow I'll focus my efforts on the<br/>Entertainment District. More people from out of<br/>town end up there.")
('Bracer Renton', "You must be the people from Arkride Solutions.<br/>I've heard all about your exploits in Edith and<br/>Langport from Alvis.")
('Bracer Renton', 'He always grumbles about you guys whenever you<br/>come up. What the heck did you guys do to give him<br/>a fuse like that?')
('Van', "You'll have to ask him. You're a friend of Alvis,<br/>though, huh? Guess I can see it. You two look 'bout<br/>the same age.")
('Bracer Renton', "We're actually a year apart, but we came up in the<br/>guild around the same time, yeah. We worked<br/>together a fair bit when we were junior bracers.")
('Bracer Renton', 'I was the first one to get promoted up to C-rank<br/>between us, but I think I might not stay ahead<br/>much longer.')
('Bracer Renton', "He says he's on the verge of hitting B-rank. Going to<br/>have to hustle if I don't want him to beat me.")
('Aaron', "Sounds like you guys have got yourselves a nice<br/>little rivalry. I know what that's like. I've got some<br/>folks like that over in my theater.")
('Bracer Renton', "I wouldn't say it's anything that serious. Just a little<br/>friendly competition, I guess.")
('Bracer Renton', "But I have done my fair share of training while<br/>traveling all over the place. I want to make the most<br/>of my time while I'm out here.")
('Bracer Renton', "Plus this city has its problems right now. As a bracer,<br/>I can't just ignore them. I have to do something<br/>to help.")
('Van', 'Good on you, man. For someone who looks pretty<br/>laid back on the outside, you actually sound pretty<br/>passionate about your job. Respect.')
('Van', "I think we're gonna get along just fine. You don't<br/>sound like the type of guy who'll give us trouble<br/>like Alvis.")
('Bracer Renton', 'Oh, yeah! I forgot that we were supposed to have a<br/>B-rank bracer coming in to help from the<br/>main branch.')
('Bracer Renton', "It'll be good to have the extra help around, but I can't<br/>let myself become dependent on it, either.")
('Bracer Renton', "If I'm going to hit that B-rank myself, I've got to try<br/>and pull my weight as best I can.")
('Bracer Ismail', "I'm so shocked and humbled to know His Highness is<br/>at the hamam. I'd heard he was an affable man, but<br/>to witness him in person...")
('Bracer Ismail', 'I never dreamed the day would come that I would<br/>have the honor of protecting someone from the royal<br/>family alongside Naje.')
('Bracer Ismail', "It's an extremely great honor, as you can imagine, not<br/>just as a bracer, but as someone versed in Elsaim's<br/>royal swordfighting style.")
('Bracer Ismail', "That was a nasty turn of events last night, and it's a<br/>shame those orbal hookahs proliferated as far as they<br/>did, even if only temporarily.")
('Bracer Ismail', "Thankfully, none of that has stopped the festival.<br/>Now it's time to do my part to ensure it's a good<br/>event for the people of Tharbad.")
('Bracer Ismail', 'I have to do whatever I can to help mitigate any<br/>disturbances or other concerns that might arise, so<br/>that everyone can get the most out of today.')
('Bracer Ismail', "Renton's apparently checking into the general<br/>movements of new arrivals, so I'm going to tackle<br/>things from a different angle.")
('Bracer Ismail', "Specifically, I'm going to ask the caravanners if<br/>they've noticed any unusual activity nearby to see if I<br/>can glean anything with their insight.")
('Bracer Ismail', "I just wish we didn't have to worry about more fights<br/>breaking out. I'd really prefer to focus entirely on<br/>our investigation. *sigh*")
('Bracer Ismail', "I've been looking into the new arrivals who are<br/>coming into the area from the Central East.")
('Bracer Ismail', 'So far, nothing suspicious has turned up about those<br/>coming from Elsaim, which means... Hmm...')
('Bracer Ismail', 'Either way, Tharbad is going to see an influx of<br/>tourists starting tomorrow. We have to optimize our<br/>intel gathering as best we can.')
('Bracer Ismail', "We can't expect our help from the capital to take care<br/>of everything for us.")
('Bracer Ismail', "It's fair to say that Tharbad acts as a bridge between<br/>the Principality of Elsaim and Calvard.")
('Bracer Ismail', "You can see that in the film festival. The Elsaim royal<br/>family has such high expectations for it, they've<br/>directly invested in it.")
('Bracer Ismail', "As both a proud master of Elsaim's royal<br/>swordfighting style, and a bracer in general, it's a<br/>genuine honor to watch over this region.")
('Feri', "You know royal swordfighting...? Wait, I know you!<br/>You're really famous in the Central East for being the<br/>strongest shamshir fighter! Wow!")
('Van', 'Guess that means you got quite the reputation back<br/>home, huh?')
('Van', 'You were born in Elsaim, right? Sounds like you have<br/>close ties to this branch of the guild, though.')
('Bracer Ismail', "I do. At first, I worked in Ludos, Elsaim's capital.<br/>But the Calvard branch was kind enough to extend an<br/>invitation, and now, here I am.")
('Bracer Ismail', "I miss home, to be sure. But I couldn't pass up<br/>this opportunity. It's a huge privilege, being stationed<br/>in such an important city.")
('Bracer Ismail', "It allows me to be of use to both Calvard and Elsaim.<br/>I like to believe that it was Arusha's will that brought<br/>me here.")
('Bracer Ismail', "I've been living in Tharbad for five years now. At this<br/>point, I think of it as my second home.")
('Bracer Ismail', "It's very fulfilling work. I get to help people who<br/>come here from all over Zemuria, as well as<br/>contribute to Calvard & Elsaim's good relations.")
('Bracer Ismail', "Recently, we've been seeing more and more trouble.<br/>It is what it is. As a bracer, I just have to keep doing<br/>my job and that's that.")
('Mahdi', 'Oh, hey, guys. I was just lending a hand with<br/>preparations for the big parade!')
('Mahdi', "The procession's going to start from the plaza here, so<br/>I thought it'd be nice if we locals pitched in to make<br/>sure it goes off without a hitch.")
('Mahdi', "After all, we're talking about HER big debut here.<br/>After watching her so long from the sidelines, I can't<br/>not help her, can I?")
('Mahdi', "They'll be filming the whole thing from that airship,<br/>too, so it's all got to look absolutely perfect from every<br/>possible angle!")
('Mahdi', "With all these tourists going nuts, I'm thinking<br/>maybe I should just cancel my Sandsea tours<br/>for today. *sigh*")
('Mahdi', "It's infuriating when people drift off from the car on<br/>a whim. I'd be in a world of trouble if any kids got<br/>lost in those sand dunes.")
('Mahdi', "Though, to be honest, I'm even more concerned<br/>about how Saara and her sister are doing right now.")
('Mahdi', "I'm happy they recruited Saara for the parade, but I'm<br/>worried she's working herself too hard. Then to have<br/>all this craziness on top of that?")
('Mahdi', '*sigh* I had a lot of tours today, which is always great.<br/>But every one of my customers was acting like a nut.<br/>It was scary.')
('Mahdi', "We've been getting a lot of people lately who're like<br/>those men who harassed Saara and Shaheena.<br/>People with no inhibitions at all.")
('Mahdi', 'I had people during my Sandsea tours that tried to<br/>wander off on me and go who knows where despite it<br/>being, you know, a desert!')
('Mahdi', "Now that Saara's been recruited to perform in the<br/>festival, I just hope nothing weird happens that ruins<br/>the parade. That'd be terrible!")
('Mahdi', "If I'm being honest with you guys, it feels like this<br/>city's gotten more and more dangerous lately, in all<br/>sorts of ways.")
('Mahdi', 'They might not show it, but I have to imagine that<br/>deep down, Saara and Shaheena are worried.<br/>They work in the streets, after all.')
('Mahdi', "Those two have so much on their plate. I really hope<br/>they can continue their dancing in peace. But who<br/>knows what's going to happen...")
('Mahdi', 'Thanks for stepping in and rescuing Saara and her<br/>sister, you guys.')
('Mahdi', "I've known those two for a long while. It's sad to say<br/>we've been seeing more and more visitors like those<br/>dirtbags walking our streets.")
('Mahdi', 'Normally, I work as a tour guide out in the Sandsea,<br/>driving people in my car. But when those girls are out<br/>dancing, I take my customers to them.')
('Mahdi', 'With things the way they are right now, though, I<br/>guess I have to start being more careful which tourists<br/>I take around, period.')
('Mahdi', 'Those two girls have been dancing ever since my little<br/>brother Timur started helping me out with<br/>the business.')
('Mahdi', "It's been great! We've both grown our customer bases<br/>and we both share some of our customers with<br/>each other. We both win when we do good.")
('Mahdi', "I owe those two a lot for what they've done.<br/>That's why I need to be careful who I take on, so I<br/>don't cause them any trouble.")
('Timur', "A lot's happened this week, but at least we finally get<br/>to see the parade!")
('Timur', 'I like movies, too, but what I really wanna see is<br/>Saara dancing!')
('Timur', "She's gonna look so pretty in the parade. She's always<br/>so beautiful, too...")
('Timur', "Anyway, I've gotta help get things ready! Talk to you<br/>guys later!")
('Timur', 'Are Shaheena and her big sister okay...?')
('Timur', "There are so many more scary people than before.<br/>I'm scared it's gonna be just like yesterday for<br/>them again.")
('Timur', 'The parade is tomorrow! If something happens to<br/>them, I, I... *sniffle*')
('Timur', 'I saw Saara talking to some hairy old guy. He<br/>was weird. He was dressed up like he was on vacation.')
('Timur', "My brother says his name is Mr. Gotti. I guess he's<br/>somebody important who works for the film festival.")
('Timur', "Saara looked so surprised when she was talking<br/>to him. Wait a minute... Is she gonna be dancing in<br/>the parade?! She is, isn't she?!")
('Timur', 'You guys were awesome! You sure taught those<br/>bullies a lesson!')
('Timur', 'Shaheena and Saara both work so hard. I can tell.')
('Timur', "How could anyone be so mean to them?!<br/>That's wrong!")
('Timur', 'My big brother and I have known Shaheena and<br/>Saara since they first came to Tharbad.')
('Timur', "He says he has a lot of sympathy for them because<br/>they're two siblings who work so hard, just like us.")
('Timur', "And I totally agree! That's as good a reason as any to<br/>make friends with someone!")
('Director Gotti', "Hey! If it isn't my favorite spriggan and company!<br/>Get a load of all this! My pride and joy is ready to be<br/>unleashed upon the city!")
('Director Gotti', "You all will be in for one hell of a show! More than<br/>you can possibly imagine! It'll shock and amaze you in<br/>ways you didn't know were shockable!")
('Director Gotti', "Ol' Gaspard...wouldn't want anyone moping over<br/>him, so I'm staying focused on delivering the glitziest,<br/>most glamorous show ever seen!")
('Director Gotti', 'As for what happened last night...well, I plan to say<br/>basically the same thing in my speech later.')
('Director Gotti', "Rumors are already beginning to float around. Way I<br/>see it, people won't be able to enjoy the festival if they<br/>have any misgivings about it.")
('Director Gotti', 'That said, I always give my speeches off the cuff.<br/>No scripts for me! You gotta talk from the heart to<br/>reach people, in my opinion.')
('Officer Camilo', 'The Tharbad Police view the rampant counterfeiting<br/>in this town as a serious problem in need<br/>of addressing.')
('Officer Camilo', "Your case deserves urgent attention from us. When I<br/>get back to the station, I'm going to notify my boss of<br/>what's happened.")
('Officer Camilo', "Rest assured, that seller won't get away with this.<br/>He WILL be brought to justice, I promise!")
('Tourist', "*sigh* How am I ever going to find this guy if even<br/>the Bracer Guild doesn't know where he is? Man...")
('Tourist', "He could be anywhere! I guess I'll wait around a little<br/>and hope I hear back from the guild...")
('Manager Fazil', "Sinem's over there, working hard.")
('Manager Fazil', "Things might be a little confusing for her at first, but<br/>the longer she does it, the more she'll come to grips<br/>with everything.")
('Manager Fazil', "It's our job to teach her as much as we can, as quick as<br/>we can, so that she can come to live an honest and<br/>independent life.")
('Manager Fazil', 'Sinem needs to get used to how things work in the<br/>bazaar, so I plan on starting her off as a barker.')
('Manager Fazil', 'With the influx of tourists right now, it ought to<br/>make for good training for her.')
('Manager Fazil', "Now that I've introduced Sinem to everyone at the<br/>bazaar, we're going to go off and have<br/>dinner somewhere.")
('Manager Fazil', "She's not so good with words, but thankfully,<br/>everyone seems to understand that she's sorry for all<br/>the trouble she's caused.")
('Manager Fazil', "Not everyone's forgiven her, but I was at least able to<br/>get them to tolerate her being in the bazaar, which is<br/>an important first step.")
('Manager Fazil', 'What happens from there might come down to how<br/>hard she decides to work.')
('Manager Fazil', "In the meantime, I think I'm going to treat her to a<br/>good meal before we head on over to the temple.<br/>It's about time she had something nice!")
('Manager Fazil', "I think I'm going to treat Sinem to a good meal<br/>before we head on over to the temple. It's about time<br/>she had something nice!")
('Manager Fazil', "Nothing's going to change with her unless we make<br/>sure she's not starving any longer.")
('Manager Fazil', "I know! I'll pay another visit to Hala's inn and see if<br/>she can throw something together for us.")
('Manager Fazil', "Obviously, I'm aware of which stalls our little thief<br/>has struck until now.")
('Manager Fazil', 'But the owners of the stalls are all a little too polite to<br/>give, shall we say, unvarnished opinions.')
('Manager Fazil', "Hopefully, if you guys talk to them instead, they'll be<br/>willing to speak their minds more freely.")
('Manager Fazil', "I'm sorry to have to get you all involved in this, but I<br/>appreciate your help. Good luck out there!")
('Manager Fazil', "Hmm... What should I do? We can't ignore this<br/>problem any longer. It's getting out of hand...")
('Aaron', '(Wonder what his problem is? He keeps mumbling<br/>on about something.)')
('Van', '(Beats me. Could be someone who needs our help.)')
('Feri', "(Why don't we see if there are any bulletin boards<br/>around here? Maybe he posted something already.)")
('Sinem', 'H-Hello! Welcome!')
('Sinem', "Er, we've got...sweet honey and, uh...the freshest<br/>apples in town. Won't you...buy some? Maybe?")
('Sinem', "(Augh! This is SO awkward! Do I really have to yell<br/>all the time? I don't know what the heck I'm<br/>supposed to say!)")
('Sinem', "(But I can't give up! I have to make at least some sales<br/>so I don't get fired...)")
('Sinem', "(Gah, hang in there, Sinem! Just give it all<br/>you've got!)")
('Sinem', "Once you find out how tasty these apples are, you'll<br/>have to stop yourself from stealing more! Just like me!")
('Sinem', "(Crap! I shouldn't have said that much! I need to<br/>change my approach, pronto!)")
('Sinem', '*sigh* How did I end up working for a stall I used to<br/>swipe food from? I mean, seriously.')
('Sinem', "But...I guess I can't complain TOO much. I have<br/>gotten some nice food to eat, and I like the room I'm<br/>staying in.")
('Sinem', "It could be worse. Maybe it's not so bad working<br/>here, after all.")
('Sinem', 'Between running away from you guys and then<br/>introducing myself to everyone at the bazaar, today<br/>has been...a lot. Like, a lot a lot.')
('Sinem', "*sigh* I'm so tired, I feel like I could pass out<br/>any second!")
('Sinem', "...I feel so lame being treated to food like<br/>that, though. Like I'm just some kind of charity case<br/>people can feel sorry for.")
('Sinem', "Not that I'm in any position to turn down that kind<br/>of thing, now that I've agreed to work at the bazaar.<br/>Ugh.")
('Manager Fazil', "I'm just about to introduce all of the vendors<br/>to Sinem.")
('Manager Fazil', "I don't exactly expect everyone to welcome her with<br/>open arms. It's quite possible some of them will give<br/>her a hard time.")
('Manager Fazil', "But it's all just part of the process. In time, I'm sure<br/>they'll learn to warm up to her, and even embrace her.")
('Feri', "Sounds like it'll be rough. Good luck, Sinem! You can<br/>do it! We've all got your back!")
('Sinem', '*sigh* I dunno what you expect me to say to<br/>these people. Seriously!')
('Sinem', "I told you before, I'm not gonna apologize for what<br/>I did!")
('Sinem', "I had to do it to survive. I would've literally died if I<br/>didn't take matters into my own hands...")
('Manager Fazil', 'Then be honest and tell them that. I think everyone<br/>knows, deep down, that was the case.')
('Manager Fazil', "Still, if you understand what you did was wrong, it<br/>wouldn't hurt to tell them you're sorry, would it?")
('Sinem', "That's what I'm saying! I'm NOT sorry about what<br/>happened, not even a lit—")
('Sinem', '*grumble*')
('Sinem', '...!')
('Manager Fazil', "Bahaha! Right, I suppose we've been talking too long.<br/>Looks like we need to get some food in you<br/>first, hmm?")
('Sinem', "MGRR! Don't laugh at me! This isn't funny!")
('Agnès', '(Heehee! She seems good at heart. Hopefully she and<br/>the sellers will learn to get along.)')
('Manager Fazil', "Okay, starting today, you're going to be helping<br/>around the bazaar.")
('Manager Fazil', "What you're about to do might feel tough while<br/>everything's new to you, but trust me, it's all a part of<br/>your training.")
('Sinem', "Yeah, right. I doubt it'll be anything THAT hard.")
('Sinem', "I've cleaned ditches and swept chimneys before.<br/>Nothing you could suggest'll scare me! Just spit it<br/>out already.")
('Manager Fazil', 'Well, if you insist. Your first job...is going to be as<br/>a barker. Congratulations!')
('Manager Fazil', "You're going to put on a loud voice and do whatever<br/>you can to drum up excitement around the stalls and<br/>bring in customers!")
('Sinem', "AJA-BWAHJA-WHAT?! You can't make me<br/>do that! I don't know how to, I dunno, hype<br/>people up!")
('Manager Fazil', "Sure you do! You just don't realize it yet. Take those<br/>apples you can find at Monir's stall.")
('Manager Fazil', "Those apples are so good, you stole them countless<br/>times, yes? If anybody can tell customers just how<br/>delicious they are, it's you.")
('Sinem', "MRRGH! Shut up! All right, all right! I'll give it<br/>a try! Just lay off me, already!")
('Van', "(Got her hittin' the ground running, I see. Hang in<br/>there, kid.)")
('Archaeologist Inigo', "Hmm... Nobody's coming...")
('Archaeologist Inigo', "Perhaps I made a mistake posting that request and it<br/>didn't reach them?")
('Van', '(Huh? Did he say something about posting<br/>a request?)')
('Van', "(Better check the bulletin board and see if there's<br/>anything new.)")
('Aaron', "Hell yeah, I like this place already. All this hustle and<br/>bustle's my kind of scene.")
('Feri', "Tharbad's famous for its bazaar.")
('Feri', 'The last time I came here, I remember there being<br/>traditional music and dancing and stuff!')
('Agnès', "Oooh, that sounds fun! I'd love to see some of that.")
('Aaron', "Hey, I recognize those things. Don't you smoke stuff<br/>out of them?")
('Agnès', "That's right. I've read about them before.")
('Agnès', "They're 'hookahs,' traditional devices that come from<br/>the Central East.")
('Aaron', "Right. Can't say I'm into smoking, but all this talk<br/>about vices has me keen on trying some of the booze<br/>around here now, heh.")
('Van', "Save the sightseein' for later, folks.")
('Van', 'We got an inn we need to check into first. It should<br/>be just past that sign over there.')
('Feri', '(Oh, hey!)')
('Shaheena', "Come on, Saara! We've gotta get going!")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'Okay, okay! Right behind you.')
('Proprietress Hala', "Feri! It's so good to see you! How've you been?")
('Feri', "I'm doing great! Nice to see you, too, Ms. Hala!")
('Agnès', 'Oh, I see, this must be where—')
('Feri', "Yeah, this is where me and the rest of the Kruga<br/>stayed before. It's neat to see it again!")
('Proprietress Hala', 'Haha. Fate has a way of bringing people together<br/>like that. Anyway, welcome to Tharbad, everyone.')
('Proprietress Hala', "Two rooms, right? I'll show you where you'll<br/>be staying. Follow me.")
('Van', 'Glad to hear it. After you.')
('Proprietress Hala', "I see! So you're living and studying in Edith these<br/>days, are you?")
('Proprietress Hala', "I'm impressed! You've grown so much in just a year.")
('Feri', "Aww, it's no big deal, really. I still have a lot to learn!")
('Feri', 'I always have to ask Agnès to explain stuff to me.<br/>I feel so bad for her.')
('Agnès', "Heehee! Please, it's fine. I enjoy teaching her things.<br/>Our Feri is a quick study.")
('Proprietress Hala', "Well, I'm glad to hear it! I can't wait to see what the<br/>future holds for her.")
('Proprietress Hala', "So you're her boss, right? Make sure you do your job,<br/>too, and look after her well, got it?")
('Van', 'Ahem! Well, somebody thinks pretty highly of you.')
('Feri', "Heehee. Yeah, she's always been really nice to me.")
('Aaron', "This'll make for a pretty solid crash pad. Rooms are<br/>clean and the food seems decent.")
('Aaron', "Guess it's time to get to work now?")
('Van', "That it is. Dingo says he's done getting us some<br/>4SPGs ready, too.")
('Van', "Let's take our time resolving whichever ones catch<br/>our eye and then head to the Al-Jumeirah Hotel in<br/>the Entertainment District by noon.")
('Feri', 'Sounds good to me!')
('Agnès', 'Great. Then off to work we go.')
('Agnès', "It's so pretty!")
('Feri', "We're definitely in Tharbad, with a view like this!")
('Van', "Yeah, you won't find this anywhere else in Calvard.")
('Van', "And that over there must be the six-star hotel we'll<br/>be visiting.")
('Agnès', "So that's the Al-Jumeirah Hotel...")
('Agnès', 'Even from this far away, it looks huge.')
('Aaron', "The Kowloon Hotel back in Langport's no slouch,<br/>but that palace of decadence might as well be made<br/>straight out of mira.")
('Feri', 'I got to check out the observation lounge when I was<br/>here before, and it was sooo luxurious inside! I was<br/>blown away!')
('Feri', 'The city at night looks amazing from up there, too.<br/>It felt different compared to Langport.')
('Aaron', "Huh. You don't say? Now I wanna see for myself.")
('Agnès', "Me, too. I'm sure it's as nice as Feri says.")
('Van', "All right, that's enough slackin' off. Can't have you<br/>kids forgetting about work this quickly.")
('Agnès', 'Hey, Feri. Is that the dancing you saw before?')
('Feri', "I think it was a different dancer before, but yeah, it is!<br/>Let's check it out!")
('Aaron', '(Damn.)')
('Feri', "(She's way better than the other dancer I saw!)")
('Agnès', "(It's captivating. I can hardly take my eyes off it...)")
(40301, 'Woo! You girls are awesome!')
(40302, 'That was beautiful!')
('Agnès', '(It felt like I was in a dream, watching that...)')
('Van', "(I know. Like those two girls were the only thing in<br/>the whole world. Hooks, lines, and sinkers won't get<br/>you that good.)")
('Aaron', "(So that's Central Eastern dancing, eh? For a couple<br/>of random chicks, they know how to capture<br/>an audience.)")
(40303, 'Man, oh, man! You girls are hot stuff!')
('Feri', 'What?')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'Th-Thank you...?')
('Shaheena', "That's so much! Are you sure?")
(40303, "Go on—help yourselves. We've taken a real liking to<br/>you girls.")
(40304, "All we ask is you come hang out with us. We've got a<br/>nice room out in the Entertainment District<br/>and everything.")
('Shaheena', 'Huh? Are you guys crazy?!')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "I'm...sorry. We're still working.")
(40303, 'What? That not enough cash for you?')
(40304, "Fine, we'll give you girls more. As much as you like.<br/>Just come with us, already!")
('Shaheena', 'Oww! L-Let me go!')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'Shaheena!')
(40305, "Hey! What do you guys think you're doing?")
(40306, "This isn't funny!")
(40307, 'Get your filthy hands off—')
(40307, 'Yikes!')
(40303, "Ha! Who are you calling filthy, huh? You locals ain't<br/>worth shit.")
(40304, 'Now go on! Scram!')
('Feri', 'Let go of them! NOW!')
(40304, 'OWW!')
(40303, 'Auuugh!')
('Agnès', 'Are you two all right?')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'Y-Yeah...')
('Shaheena', 'What is their problem?!')
(40304, "Gah! What is with this freaky kid? Hey, you two!<br/>What do you think you're doing? Get over here<br/>and—")
(40304, 'Huh?!')
(40308, 'Gwurgk!')
(40309, "I...can't move!")
('Van', 'Well, well. We got some jaeger dropouts, I see.')
('Aaron', 'Sucks to be you two, having such morons for bosses.')
(40303, 'Wh-What did you say?!')
('Van', "So, you're lookin' for some company, it sounds like.<br/>Got yourselves a pretty fancy room reserved here<br/>and everything.")
('Aaron', "The film festival's not for another three days,<br/>you know. What if we helped you catch some z's<br/>until then?")
(40304, 'Hmph.')
('Bracer Renton', "Hey, what's going on here?")
(40303, "Great, now we've got bracers giving us grief!")
(40304, 'Shit!')
(40303, 'Just when we thought we could have some fun in this<br/>dump of a city, you guys had to ruin it!')
(40304, "We'd better not catch you again or else there'll be hell<br/>to pay! You hear us?!")
('Aaron', "Pfft. That's supposed to be our line.")
(40307, 'You guys were amazing! You got rid of them like they<br/>were nothing!')
(40306, "I'm so glad to see those guys gone. What a relief!")
('Feri', "Oh... Guess I made a bit of a scene. I'm sorry.")
('Agnès', "It's okay, Feri. It all worked out in the end.")
('Van', "*sigh* What a morning, and we only just got here.<br/>...Hey, you ladies okay? Those guys didn't rough you<br/>up too badly, did they?")
('Shaheena', "Oh, no. We're fine!")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'Thank you so much!')
('Bracer Renton', "Well, looks like everything's under control here.")
('Bracer Ismail', 'Yeah. I think those were the guys Zin mentioned<br/>before, too.')
('System', 'With the harassers gone, the audience members<br/>donated tips to the two dancers before dispersing.')
('System', 'Likewise, the pair of bracers resumed their patrol.')
('Van', 'Here—these are on me.')
('Shaheena', 'Wow, really? Thank you!')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "You really don't need to. You've already done so<br/>much for us.")
('Van', "No, no, I insist. Consider it my way of sayin' thanks<br/>for putting on such a good show.")
('Shaheena', "Heehee! We make a good act, right? Especially Saara!<br/>Nobody's as good a dancer as her!")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'Shaheena, stop...')
('Agnès', "I'm just glad to see you two are all right after all<br/>of that. That's what counts.")
('Feri', "I'm really sorry for just barging in like that. I could've<br/>done better...")
('Feri', "Uhh... Actually, what're your names?")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "Oh, I guess we haven't introduced ourselves.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "I'm Saara. My younger sister and I dance for a living.")
('Shaheena', "And I'm Shaheena. Nice to meet you!")
('Shaheena', "Anyway, what's your deal, old dude? What do you<br/>all do? You don't look like bracers.")
('Van', 'D-Did you just...?')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "SHAHEENA! Don't call him that! That's rude.")
('Shaheena', "Huh? But he is. Isn't he?")
('Aaron', "BWAHAHAHA! Looks like I'm not the only one<br/>who thinks you look old, gramps!")
('Van', "Shut up! It isn't funny! *sigh* Anyway...")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "So you guys go around solving people's problems?<br/>That's interesting. I had no idea there were jobs like<br/>that in the capital.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', '(Could they be the ones people have been talking<br/>about since yesterday...?)')
('Shaheena', "Wow, that's so cool! It sounds like a really, uhh...<br/>grownup thing to do!")
('Van', "...It's okay, you don't have to tiptoe around me.<br/>I'm over it.")
('Aaron', "Sucks to be you, chief. Anyway, real talk—I'm glad<br/>we were there to handle those guys for you girls.")
('Aaron', 'Do creeps like that tend to give you two grief a lot?')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'Actually, no. The vast majority of tourists who come<br/>watch us are quite polite.')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "Though I can't deny that sort of trouble has been on<br/>the rise all over the city the past few days.")
('Feri', "Well, that's a bummer. Could it be because...?")
('Agnès', 'Of the film festival coming up so soon? I think so.')
('Agnès', "You only have to look at the parking lots to see that<br/>there're people from all over Zemuria, not just<br/>Calvard, coming to attend.")
('Van', "And among those visitors are guys who think they're<br/>hot shit, makin' it big through investments or<br/>startup companies. Perfect recipe for fun.")
('Van', 'Given that, I can understand how things would be<br/>happening around here.')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "I'm sorry, I don't think I know what you mean.<br/>Could you—")
('Van', "Don't worry about it. Just stuff to do with work on<br/>our end.")
('Shaheena', 'Well, you guys had real crazy moves when you<br/>confronted those other guys back there!')
('Shaheena', "Feri was so fast, I didn't even see her coming!<br/>And you two were super quick, too!")
('Shaheena', "Hey, you all should learn how to dance while you're<br/>in town! I bet you'd do great!")
('Shaheena', "I'll teach Feri and Saara'll teach Agnès! What do<br/>you say?")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "Sha-hee-na! I'm sure they've got more important<br/>things to do than hang out with us!")
('Feri', 'Heehee! I am a bit curious about how you guys dance,<br/>now that you mention it.')
('Agnès', 'It was so pretty. You two were really amazing<br/>to watch. What sort of dance is it, exactly?')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'We come from a family of dancers that have passed<br/>our form down from generation to generation.<br/>Our mother taught us these moves.')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "I guess I wouldn't be against teaching you a little bit<br/>about what we do if it helps keep our<br/>traditions alive...")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "All right. Clearly, it feels like we were meant to meet.<br/>If you're interested, I'd be happy to show you<br/>the basics. What do you say?")
('Feri', "Wow, really? Sure, I'd love to learn more once we're<br/>done with our work here!")
('Agnès', "Well, if Feri's in, I can hardly say no. I don't know if<br/>I'll be able to keep up with you, but I'll try my best.")
('Aaron', 'You know, I bet there are things from it that I could<br/>apply to my sword dancing, too. I might just join in<br/>on those lessons.')
('Shaheena', 'Whoa! You can do that?!')
('Shaheena', 'Hey, the more I think about it, the more I think you<br/>might even be able to pull off our outfits, too!')
('Aaron', "Oh, yeah? Sure, that'd be a piece of cake. Nothing I<br/>haven't done before.")
('Agnès', "(Oh, I hadn't thought about wearing those outfits...<br/>Do I, umm, really want to?)")
('Feri', "I can't wait to start learning!")
('Van', "*sigh* You kids do recall that we're here on<br/>assignment, right?")
('Nina', 'Hi, Van! Thanks for picking up.')
('Nina', "Looks like you're all in Tharbad?")
('Van', 'Hey, stranger. Yep, we rolled in here first thing in<br/>the morning.')
('Nina', "That's good! I hope the long drive didn't take too<br/>much of a toll on you.")
('Nina', 'I know this might be a little early for you, but we also<br/>actually got in by airship just a little while ago.')
('Van', "Nice. So we'll be able to sit down and talk about the<br/>job soon.")
('Van', 'Do you want us to head over right away?')
('Nina', "Oh, no, there's no rush. As long as we can talk by<br/>noon, any time works for us.")
('Nina', 'Plus we still need to unpack and—')
('Judith', 'Hey, Nina? Have you seen the key to my<br/>suitcase anywhere?')
('Van', '(Hmm?)')
('Nina', 'Umm, no? Why would I have seen that?')
('Nina', "Ah! Sorry about that! I'll see you all at the hotel, then.")
('Van', 'Sounds good. See you then.')
('Agnès', 'Was that Nina you were talking to?')
('Van', 'Yeah, sounds like she just got into town. Once we<br/>find time, we should make our way over to the<br/>Al-Jumeirah Hotel.')
('Van', '(Still, that voice sounded like...)')
('Shaheena', "Hold on, did you say 'Nina'? As in Nina Fenly?!")
('Shaheena', 'You guys know her?!')
('Feri', 'Uhh...')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "Ah, don't mind her. She just really likes movies.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "Sometimes the big screen out in the Entertainment<br/>District will show free movies, which we'll catch.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "Ever since they announced the film festival was<br/>coming to Tharbad, Shaheena's been a ball<br/>of excitement.")
('Shaheena', 'Well, duh! How could I not be?')
('Shaheena', 'Lots of famous actors, actresses, and directors are<br/>gonna be in town, not just Nina!')
('Shaheena', "Are you guys gonna go meet with her later? I'm<br/>SO jealous! Augh!")
('Agnès', "Do you want us to try and get you an autograph<br/>from her? She'd probably say yes if we ask nicely.")
('Shaheena', "F-F-For real?! You'd do that for me?!")
('Van', "Well, we can't make any promises. Only if she's<br/>comfortable with it.")
('Shaheena', "Oh, that's fine! Please! I love you guys so much!<br/>I promise not to call you an old guy any more if you<br/>do this for me!")
('Van', "You don't have to keep bringing that up!")
('Aaron', "I think there's no escape for you, dude.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "I'm really sorry about her. If you could do it, it would<br/>mean the world to her.")
('Van', 'Anyway, we should be in town for two or three days.')
('Van', "If anything else comes up, feel free to contact us.<br/>It'll cost you extra, but we'll be more than happy<br/>to help.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "...Oh! Okay, thank you. I'll let you know if we<br/>need anything.")
('System', 'After that, the sisters went back to perform some<br/>more while Van and the others opted to visit the<br/>Entertainment District.')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "Hi, everyone. It's nice to see you again.")
('Feri', 'Hey, Shaheena! Hi, Saara!')
('Agnès', 'Is this your home?')
('Shaheena', "Yep! It's pretty small, but it's home sweet home!")
('Shaheena', "I wish we could bring you inside, but we've got<br/>another performance coming up soon that we need to<br/>get ready for.")
('Van', "It's no problem. Good to see you ladies are keeping<br/>busy, honestly. Haven't run into any trouble since this<br/>morning, I hope?")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'No, luckily. Thank you for asking.')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "We've been getting bigger crowds than usual, but<br/>luckily, nobody else has acted strangely.")
('Shaheena', "Maybe they heard about how you guys saved the day<br/>earlier and that's made all the other weirdos<br/>think twice. We can hope!")
('Shaheena', "Still...I'm tiiired. I think I'm gonna stop by the<br/>hamam on the way back.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "That sounds nice. Hopefully that'll keep your spirits<br/>up until we're all done.")
('Aaron', "Well, if any more asshats try to creep on you girls, let<br/>us know. We'll sort them out just like the others.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "Thank you. We really appreciate it. Well, we'd better<br/>get back to work.")
('Shaheena', "You guys are pretty handsome, but if you're thinking<br/>of making a move on Saara, I'd think twice.")
('Shaheena', "Know why? 'Cause it looks like she's got a boyfriend!")
('Van', 'Oh, really now?')
('Aaron', "Hell, your sister's such a catch, I'd be shocked if<br/>she didn't. Don't be surprised if I whisk her away if<br/>he turns out to be a loser, though.")
('Agnès', 'Van. Aaron.')
('Feri', '...?')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'Shaheena, what are you doing? We have to go!')
('Shaheena', 'Coming! ...See you guys later!')
('Feri', 'Oh, wait! The autographs!')
('Agnès', 'We forgot to give them to her.')
('Van', "I wouldn't bother right now when they're about<br/>to perform. I'm sure we'll see them again. We can<br/>make Shaheena's day then.")
('Feri', 'Hey, Mr. Jahm! Nice to see you!')
('Manager Jahm', 'Oh, hey there, Ferida! Wow, you certainly have<br/>grown since I saw you a year ago.')
('Manager Jahm', "...And I take it you're the spriggan Hala told<br/>me about.")
('Van', "Yep. Name's Van Arkride. Normally I work out of<br/>Edith, but I'm here for a job.")
('Van', "Hala told us to come meet you. Why don't you tell us<br/>what's going on, and we'll see what we can do?")
('Manager Jahm', "All right. It's probably easier if I just show you.<br/>Follow me.")
('Aaron', 'Ah, well, I can see how you might have a<br/>problem here.')
('Agnès', "Where's all the water?")
('Manager Jahm', 'Normally, I get it pumped in here from the oasis<br/>through the underground waterway that runs<br/>around here.')
('Manager Jahm', "Unfortunately, it suddenly stopped coming in this<br/>morning, and it's been like this ever since.")
('Van', "That's definitely a little concerning. Does this sort of<br/>thing happen often?")
('Manager Jahm', 'No. Almost never, believe it or not.')
('Manager Jahm', "There was one time when the oasis itself dried up<br/>about twenty years ago, but that's about it.")
('Manager Jahm', "Back then, a renowned scholar investigated the<br/>problem for us and constructed a water management<br/>system that's handled any problems.")
('Feri', 'Who would that be?')
('Agnès', "He must mean Professor Latoya Hamilton.<br/>She's famous for handling the waterworks out here.")
('Agnès', "It didn't just restore the oasis to where it was<br/>at before. In fact, it became several times bigger.")
('Agnès', "Her work is said to be directly linked to Tharbad's<br/>rise as an entertainment destination.")
('Manager Jahm', "That's right. What that woman did was nothing short<br/>of a miracle for our city.")
('Manager Jahm', 'I happened to catch a glimpse of her, and she seemed<br/>incredibly kind. And a real beauty, I might add.')
('Van', "You don't say... Gah! Anyway, getting back to the<br/>problem at hand...")
('Van', "If nothing's wrong with the oasis, then that probably<br/>means there's somethin' going on in that<br/>underground waterway you mentioned.")
('Manager Jahm', "That's what I've reckoned, too.")
('Manager Jahm', 'I really want to get this figured out so I can reopen<br/>my business and get back to serving customers.')
('Manager Jahm', "Unfortunately, the guild's so busy right now that they<br/>can't send anyone to take a look until at<br/>least tomorrow.")
('Manager Jahm', 'I know it might cost more to get it done sooner, but<br/>do you think you all would be able to handle<br/>it instead?')
('Aaron', "Basically, you want us to play plumber instead of the<br/>guild like they're supposed to. Is that it?")
('Feri', "I think we should do it. Saara 'n' Shaheena are<br/>supposed to come by here after work. I'd hate to see<br/>them disappointed...")
('Agnès', 'Me, too. I know this is getting off track from our<br/>main assignment, but is there any way we could help<br/>him out, Van?')
('Van', 'Hmm...')
('Van', "Yeah, all right. We'll do it.")
('Van', "But you're right, pal. It is going to cost you more.<br/>In addition to the guild's standard work fee, I want a<br/>free bath for everyone. Deal?")
('Manager Jahm', 'Haha, I think that can be arranged. Deal!')
('Manager Jahm', "So, in that case, you'll need this to get down there.")
('System', 'Obtained a key to the underground waterway.')
('Manager Jahm', "When you leave here, take a right and you'll find an<br/>old maintenance way. You can climb down into the<br/>waterway from there.")
('Manager Jahm', 'But be careful. Monsters do tend to get down there<br/>at times.')
('Van', "That shouldn't be a problem. Thanks for the tip.")
('Aaron', "Well, what are we waiting for? Let's get those pipes<br/>fixed so we can get our bathing on!")
('Feri', 'Cool! Now we can enter.')
('Aaron', 'Actually, I wanted to ask before we go in: you seemed<br/>to be thinking pretty hard earlier before you accepted<br/>this gig.')
('Aaron', 'Something seem off about all this?')
('Agnès', 'What?')
('Van', "Good eye. I didn't realize anyone was<br/>payin' attention. Yeah, there's something.")
('Van', "It's just a hunch, but considerin' nothing else has gone<br/>wrong the last twenty years, the timing of this sure<br/>seems fishy.")
('Van', "I don't know what it is, but it doesn't feel like a<br/>coincidence to me.")
('Feri', 'Hmm...')
('Agnès', 'Now that I think about it, the odds of this<br/>happening purely by chance do feel awfully low.')
('Van', "Exactly. Plus it didn't sound like there's been weird<br/>gang or monster activity lately, which makes this even<br/>more suspicious.")
('Van', 'With all these threatening notes going around and<br/>everything with the Geneses, this feels like...<br/>an omen.')
('Agnès', '...!')
('Aaron', 'Talk about timing.')
('Feri', 'What the heck is down there...?')
('Van', "Your guess is as good as mine. Now stay<br/>sharp, everyone. We're going in.")
('Agnès', "The Marduk Company? That's not the first I've<br/>heard that name recently.")
('Agnès', "They do security, I think? And I believe they're<br/>based outside of Calvard.")
('Risette', 'Correct. Their main headquarters is located in the<br/>Ored State.')
('Risette', 'While still a young company, it already enjoys a large<br/>customer base within and without Calvard.')
('Risette', 'As I mentioned, Mr. Arkride is contracted with us as<br/>an external tester for our tactical research and<br/>development division.')
('Van', "Yep. That's how I wound up with the program for<br/>Mare and my trusty little stun caliber.")
('Van', "We're equal partners in this endeavor.")
('Risette', "Beyond that, in recent times, we've developed ties to<br/>various nations' public security apparatuses, as well as<br/>most every mercenary enterprise.")
('Risette', 'We even maintain a technological partnership with<br/>the Warriors of Kruga, albeit only in a<br/>partial capacity.')
('Feri', 'Yeah, I remember hearing about that. Although...')
('Agnès', "...I've heard rumors about your company before.<br/>But that's an awful lot for one private military<br/>company to handle.")
('Agnès', 'Does that mean Marduk basically divides its business<br/>between its general security and its tactical research<br/>and development divisions?')
('Aaron', 'You guys must be swimming in cash these days.')
('Aaron', 'Taking up more and more market share as you supply<br/>tech services to militaries and jaegers alike sounds like<br/>a hell of a recipe for success.')
('Risette', 'Leave it to Mr. Arkride to employ such<br/>sharp assistants. It pleases me to see the next<br/>generation is coming along well.')
('Van', "I ain't lookin' for anyone to succeed me here.<br/>They're just part-time helpers around the office,<br/>that's all.")
('Van', "But enough about us. You still haven't told us what<br/>the hell you're doin' all the way out here.")
('Van', 'I understand how dedicated and responsible you are<br/>as a concierge, and I appreciate how much you guys<br/>value me as a tester.')
('Van', "And to be clear, I'm grateful for all the maintenance<br/>work you do remotely for my Xipha, too. You've been<br/>a big help.")
('Van', "Yet comin' out here like this—that gets into 'stupid'<br/>levels of service. I know for a fact you've got other<br/>stuff to do.")
('Van', "So why go to all this trouble, huh? What's going on<br/>behind the scenes to make you drop everything and<br/>wander on out here?")
('Risette', "...I suppose I can fill you in on what's happening, but<br/>on one condition.")
('Risette', 'You agree to tell me about the anomalies surrounding<br/>the shards and your holo core, as well as that<br/>stolen device. Do we have a deal?')
('Van', 'Hmm...')
('Agnès', "That's...a lot to ask.")
('Aaron', '(This chick plays hard.)')
('Risette', "Heehee. You may rest assured—I'm merely joking.<br/>You don't need to go into such detail.")
('Risette', "There are two reasons as to why I've traveled<br/>to Tharbad.")
('Risette', 'One of them was indeed to make direct contact with<br/>Mr. Arkride.')
('Risette', "After all, I couldn't help but be concerned when our<br/>previous call was cut short in the manner that it was.")
('Van', "Yeah, uhh...my bad. I didn't mean for it to be such a<br/>big deal.")
('Aaron', 'You sound like someone trying to explain to his girl<br/>why he was two-timing her when you talk like that,<br/>you know.')
('Agnès', '...')
('Feri', '(Yikes. Agnès looks super tense!)')
('Risette', 'My other reason for coming to this city is to<br/>investigate the film festival in person.')
('Van', 'Say what?')
('Agnès', 'Why would you need to do that?')
('Risette', 'Quite simply, it is related to the Messeldam Film<br/>Festival that was set to take place two months ago.')
('Risette', 'It has to do with the circumstances surrounding<br/>its cancellation.')
('Feri', 'You mean that racial terrorism stuff?')
('Aaron', "No kidding? I think I'm seeing where this is going.")
('Risette', 'As you all know, Messeldam was forced to cancel the<br/>festival after receiving a terrorist threat and witnessing<br/>a wave of suspicious fires.')
('Risette', 'The city, along with the local security company that<br/>was forced to pay a fine for the resulting breach of<br/>contract, requested our services.')
('Risette', "That incident appears to be linked to Tharbad's<br/>festival, which has received greater attention than was<br/>otherwise anticipated.")
('Risette', "As a result, the decision was made to dispatch me<br/>to reassess the company's risk evaluation<br/>for Calvard.")
('Van', "So that's what's going on, huh? Now I get it.")
('Feri', "Uh, I'm sorry, but I think I got lost somewhere<br/>around 'Messeldam canceled.'")
('Agnès', "Basically, if I understand her correctly, Risette is here<br/>to evaluate Calvard's security risks, nationwide.")
('Agnès', "That way, she and her company can be prepared to<br/>provide any necessary 'services' if and when<br/>they're needed.")
('Aaron', "The way she talks, it sounds like Calvard's hardly the<br/>only one her place keeps a close eye on.")
('Aaron', "Hell...it sounds a lot like how Heiyue's elders tend<br/>to think.")
('Aaron', 'These guys have got their fingers in some pretty<br/>dicey pies.')
('Risette', 'I completely understand your concern. It is certainly<br/>true that Marduk makes its money from wars and<br/>national-scale law enforcement.')
('Risette', 'On the other hand, we also take pride in<br/>demonstrably contributing in part to regional security.')
('Risette', 'We also help to combat criminal cabals and other<br/>such groups, including ones that have seen their<br/>threat level grow...inconceivably large.')
('Feri', '...!')
('Aaron', "You're talking about...")
('Agnès', 'I guess it only makes sense that your company would<br/>be involved in that, too.')
('Van', "So, long story short, circumstances more or less forced<br/>you to come out here anyway. I wasn't the only factor.")
('Van', "That's all I need to know, then. I won't pry<br/>any further.")
('Van', "Is all that to say that you're basically on loan to us?<br/>If so, I'll give you free reign to act however you deem<br/>fit while we're here.")
('Van', "Your skills are even better than I expected, now that<br/>I've seen 'em in person. You've got my trust, Risette,<br/>don't worry.")
('Risette', 'That is very reassuring to hear. It will be a pleasure<br/>working together with you in person, Mr. Arkride.')
('Feri', 'Wait a second! Does this mean—')
('Aaron', "Are you saying we have to team up with this chick?<br/>You sure you don't want to give that some<br/>more thought?!")
('Agnès', '...')
('Van', "If you guys feel that strongly about it, I won't force<br/>you to work with her.")
('Van', "But you all saw what happened back in the waterway.<br/>I don't think we should look a gift horse in<br/>the mouth.")
('Agnès', 'Hmm...')
('Feri', 'Well...')
('Agnès', '...')
('Aaron', "*sigh* I guess you've got a point.")
('Van', "We're dealin' with that girl and the angel thing, and<br/>they both ran off once they got their hands on<br/>the Genesis.")
('Van', "We might not have hard evidence yet, but if I had to<br/>point fingers at who's behind it, I know who my first<br/>guess would be.")
('Feri', 'Yeah...')
('Agnès', "I agree. It's entirely possible that Almata could be<br/>lurking out here, too.")
('Risette', "I cannot claim to be fully aware of your specific<br/>circumstances, but our analysis does suggest that's<br/>quite possible.")
('Risette', "Having said that, I also believe that it's too early to<br/>rule out other potential actors as well.")
('Risette', "To that end, I will do whatever I can to help, even if<br/>I'm still relatively inexperienced as a concierge.")
('Aaron', '...Heh.')
('Feri', 'Hmm...')
('Risette', 'Also, regarding the anomaly between Mare and<br/>Mr. Arkride...')
('Risette', "It's rather curious to see an AI with no will manifest<br/>and react in that manner—as well as for its user to be<br/>covered so densely in shards.")
('Risette', "I may, however, be able to devise a treatment to<br/>address the symptoms of such unforeseen 'outbursts.'")
('Risette', 'I speak not only as a professional. I sincerely wish to<br/>help on a personal level as well.')
('Agnès', 'Oh...')
('Van', "You're really somethin'.")
('Risette', 'I understand that I may be imposing upon you, and<br/>that you all may have trouble accepting my presence.<br/>I truly do.')
('Risette', "Regardless, would it be all right for me to accompany<br/>you all for the next few days while you're in the city?")
('Agnès', "...Risette, it's okay. You don't have to be so hesitant.")
('Agnès', 'We would be happy to have you with us. In fact, it<br/>would be really reassuring.')
('Feri', 'Yeah! Those wall things you used earlier were really<br/>cool, too!')
('Aaron', "Hell, if anything, I wouldn't be shocked if<br/>you turned out to be more reliable than our<br/>chief here.")
('Van', 'Hey, watch your mouth. Not that I can disagree...')
('Risette', 'Thank you, Ms. Claudel, Ms. Al-Fayed, Mr. Wei.')
('Risette', 'Then from now on, I, Risette Twinings...')
('Risette', '...will accompany you, Arkride Solutions, during<br/>your three-day mission in Tharbad.')
('System', "After that, the group enjoyed a nice, milky batch of<br/>chai, courtesy of the inn's proprietress, as thanks for<br/>all of their hard work.")
('System', 'As they did so, they summarized to Risette the<br/>sequence of events up until their current mission for<br/>Nina Fenly and Judith Lanster.')
('System', 'They delved into the Geneses and the Grendel, as well<br/>as the crimes committed by Almata—revelations that<br/>stunned the concierge.')
('System', 'For her part, she swore to keep what she learned<br/>strictly confidential and not divulge anything to her<br/>employer without permission.')
('System', 'Such sincere consideration for their circumstances<br/>further cemented the newfound trust Arkride<br/>Solutions had in Risette.')
('System', 'Soon enough, with the sun setting, Van fully<br/>recovered and regained his stamina.')
('System', 'The party decided to venture back outside, both to<br/>find a place to eat at for dinner, as well as to report<br/>back to the actresses on their progress.')
(500, 'October 5th, 6:02PM')
('Aaron', 'Now this is more my kind of scene! A city only really<br/>comes alive at night, if you ask me.')
('Aaron', "You know what that means: time to hit the streets<br/>and see what sorts of joints with foxy ladies they've<br/>got around here.")
('Agnès', 'Aaron. Do grow up.')
('Feri', "I dunno what these 'fox ladies' you're talking<br/>about are. All I know is, I'm starving!")
('Van', "Don't mind him—he's just driving with his pants, you<br/>might say. We've still got some time to kill before<br/>our meeting.")
('Van', "Let's take another look around town while scopin' out<br/>somewhere to sit down and eat.")
('Van', "I know it's not the most efficient way of going about<br/>things, but it's how I do it as a spriggan.")
('Van', "Hope us just meandering around a bit doesn't drive<br/>you too up the wall.")
('Risette', "Oh, no. Not at all. I'm actually quite interested<br/>to learn. I've wanted to know more about your work<br/>for some time.")
('Risette', 'To summarize, the plan is to check for new 4SPG<br/>requests, responding to them as necessary while<br/>continuing to survey the city on foot, yes?')
('Risette', "Then, when the time is right, we'll make our way to<br/>the Al-Jumeirah to report in to Ms. Fenly and<br/>Ms. Lanster. Is my understanding correct?")
('Aaron', "Wow. You didn't take long to adapt to how we<br/>do things.")
('Feri', "Seriously. It's like she's been with us this whole time.")
('Agnès', "(Quick, Agnès! You've got to contribute something!<br/>Somethiiing...!)")
('Agnès', 'Oh, yes! We still need to deliver those autographs<br/>to Shaheena!')
('Van', "Hey, you're right. I forgot all about that.")
('Feri', "Gaaah! Me, too! D'you think she's home by now?")
('Aaron', "Nah, not yet. Don't you remember? She said she<br/>wanted to stop by the hamam on their way back<br/>from work.")
('Van', "Good point. I'm sure it's reopened by now. Might as<br/>well stop by and see how they're doing.")
('Agnès', "Sounds like a plan! W-Well, what are we waiting for?<br/>No time to lose! Let's get to work, everyone!")
('Risette', "Heehee, indeed. Lead the way, everyone. I'll<br/>follow along.")
('System', 'Received')
('System', 'Risette joined the party.')
('Feri', 'Hi, Shaheena! Hi, Saara!')
('Van', 'Looks like our hunch was right. Good to see<br/>you ladies.')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'Oh, hello, everyone!')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'The owner was just telling us about you all.')
('Shaheena', 'It sounds like you guys had to clear out some<br/>monsters to get the baths back up and running.')
('Shaheena', "That's amazing! I knew you guys were talented!")
('Manager Jahm', "Thanks again for everything you all did. I'd still be in<br/>dire straits if it weren't for you folks.")
('Van', 'Eh, all part of being a spriggan. We got plenty out of<br/>that whole exercise, too, so it was good for everyone.')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "Well, that's good to hear.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "By the way, who might you be? I don't believe you<br/>were with them earlier.")
('Risette', 'Forgive my late introduction. You may call<br/>me Risette. I was dispatched here on short notice.')
('Risette', "You two are Ms. Saara and Ms. Shaheena, correct?<br/>It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'N-Nice to meet you, too.')
('Shaheena', "Wait, is that a maid outfit you're wearing?! I've never<br/>seen one of those in person before!")
('Risette', 'Hmm... Not precisely. This is the uniform that I wear<br/>for work.')
('Risette', 'You can think of it as a combat suit designed to let<br/>me offer maximum support to my customers<br/>when needed.')
('Shaheena', "That sounds, umm, complicated. Whatever it is, you<br/>look super cool in it, that's for sure!")
('Shaheena', "Hey, since we're all here, why don't you guys join us<br/>in the baths?")
('Shaheena', "There's so much I wanna talk about!")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'That sounds like fun. Maybe we could all get dinner<br/>together afterwards, too?')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "There's a place close by I always go to that I'm sure<br/>you all would enjoy.")
('Van', "Sure. We'd be happy to take you up on that.")
('Van', 'Probably not a bad idea for us to wash up before we<br/>meet with our clients again, anyway.')
('Aaron', "Say what you like—I know you're just looking for an<br/>excuse to take a dip. Not that I'm AGAINST it.")
('Feri', "I could really use a bite to eat, but that's okay. A bath<br/>sounds good after everything we've done today!")
('Agnès', "Then it's settled. We'll join you two in the baths.")
('Shaheena', "Yay! That's perfect! Come on, I'll show you where the<br/>girls' ones are!")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "Shaheena, calm down. They've had a long day.")
('Manager Jahm', "Haha. Take as long as you want in there, folks.<br/>You've earned it.")
('Aaron', "Maaan, this blows. I didn't consider the fact that I'd<br/>be stuck alone in here with you.")
('Van', "Would you pipe down? You're killin' the vibe.")
('Van', 'Just close your eyes and relax. Embrace the<br/>tranquility, and then—')
('Aaron', 'Oh, shut up. I bet you every mira in my wallet the<br/>girls are living it up on the other side of this wall.')
('Aaron', "Speaking of girls, man, I'd kill to check out that maid<br/>and the older sister's scorching bods right<br/>about—bwah!")
('Van', "We sit on sacred ground, punk. Don't defile it with<br/>your libido.")
('Van', "Keep it up and I'll scrub you down till your skin is<br/>raw, if that's what it takes to clean that dirty brain of<br/>yours for the first time.")
('Aaron', "All right, I'll drop it! Aidios, you don't have to be so<br/>serious about it.")
('Risette', "Heehee. They're certainly having a lively time<br/>over there.")
('Agnès', "Ugh... Don't they realize we can hear every word<br/>they're saying?")
('Shaheena', "He's not wrong, though. All you girls are just as<br/>gorgeous as Saara.")
('Shaheena', "I mean, Risette's hair and skin are both so silky, she<br/>practically looks like a doll!")
('Shaheena', "You're so pretty, too, Agnès! And how do you<br/>get those when you're only sixteen?!")
('Agnès', 'Huh?')
('Shaheena', "I'm only a year younger than you! There's no way I'm<br/>gonna be able to catch up that quickly!")
('Shaheena', "What's your secret? What do you eat to fill out like<br/>that, huh?!")
('Feri', "...Truth be told, I've been kinda curious, too. I'd love<br/>to know for future reference.")
('Agnès', "I, umm, well, I... I don't do anything special.")
('Agnès', "F-Feri! Stop staring at me so much! You're<br/>scaring me!")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'Shaheena, please. Cool it down a little.')
('Risette', 'Well, I personally think Ms. Al-Fayed and Ms.<br/>Shaheena are very beautiful in their own right.')
('Risette', 'If anything, I should comment on your skin,<br/>Ms. Saara. What sort of regimen do you use to<br/>achieve such a glossy look?')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'Oh, I just use shea butter. The stuff they make in<br/>Tharbad is really good and—')
('Shaheena', "HOLY COW! You got Nina Fenly's AND Judith<br/>Lanster's autographs?!")
('Shaheena', "Thank you guys so much! I'll treasure these<br/>forever, really!")
('Feri', "Aww, it's no problem! I'm glad you like them!")
('Aaron', "Those autographs have gotta be worth a pretty mira.<br/>We're talking about two of the hottest stars around.<br/>Think you might sell them?")
('Shaheena', 'No way! How could I ever?!')
('Shaheena', 'Still, it feels so surreal right now.')
('Shaheena', "I can't believe my own sister is gonna be dancing up<br/>on stage with folks like them! Who<br/>would've thought?!")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "Don't get too excited about it all, Shaheena. I don't<br/>think they're going to ask me to do anything that big.")
('Shaheena', "Well, I still think it's awesome you get to be involved<br/>at all!")
('Van', 'From what I heard, Salvatore Gotti himself scouted<br/>you out. Is that true?')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "Yeah, he walked right up to me and asked if I wanted<br/>to take part in the 'Carnal Cavalcade.'")
('Van', 'Wait. By dancing, do you mean for the<br/>Carnal Cavalcade?')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'Yeah. Some director named Salvatore Gotti walked<br/>up to me and asked if I wanted to take part.')
('Shaheena', 'Not just him. He was with some other<br/>snappy-looking guy, too.')
('Shaheena', "They went nuts for Saara. Apparently Mr. Gotti was<br/>all, 'Baby, you're more perfect than Aidios herself!<br/>My parade isn't complete without you!'")
('Shaheena', "He was dead set on bringing her on, whatever it took.<br/>It wasn't long before she folded like a house of<br/>cards, heehee.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "Shaheena! You don't have to tell them every little<br/>thing about it!")
('Risette', "I am not sure I know what this 'Carnal Cavalcade' is.<br/>Is it some event that will be part of the film festival?")
('Aaron', "Yeah, it's a parade that'll kick off when the<br/>festival opens.")
('Agnès', "It sounds like it's going to be quite the production.<br/>Like Shaheena said, I guess it's supposed to include<br/>famous actresses and whatnot.")
('Feri', "I can see you fitting right in there, Saara!<br/>You're gonna do great!")
('Van', "I know Gotti can talk pretty raunchy, but his passion<br/>and taste are the real deal. He didn't say all that just<br/>to be nice.")
('Van', "If he says you're perfect, then he means it. You'll do<br/>just fine out there, Saara. I know you've got what<br/>it takes.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'Th-Thanks, Van! That means a lot.')
('Shaheena', 'Heeheehee. Am I seeing things, or are you turning a<br/>little red?')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'I am NOT! Stop it!')
('Timur', 'Saara! Sheenie!')
('Timur', 'There you two are! Where have you guys been?')
('Shaheena', 'Hey, Timur. We were just hanging out in<br/>the hamam.')
('Shaheena', "And quit calling me Sheenie! I've got a real name,<br/>you know!")
('Timur', "Haha! Sorry, Sheenie. You'll always be Sheenie<br/>to me!")
('Van', 'This a friend of yours?')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "Yeah, he's a kid from the neighborhood.<br/>What's going on, Timur? Why were you looking<br/>for us?")
('Timur', "'Cause someone asked me to give this to you, Saara,<br/>that's why.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "A letter? That's strange. I wonder what it could be.<br/>Thanks, Timur.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', '...What the?')
('Agnès', 'Is everything okay?')
('Shaheena', "What's wrong, Saa—what in the world?!")
('System', 'Decline to participate in the parade, or tragedy will<br/>befall you.')
('Aaron', "Is this somebody's sick idea of a joke?")
('Van', '...')
('Feri', "I can't believe even Saara, of all people, got one of<br/>those threatening notes...")
('Agnès', 'According to that Timur boy, a Central Easterner<br/>that he passed who was working for a shipping<br/>company gave the note to him.')
('Van', "I'd guess that delivery person's most likely innocent.")
('Van', "Just like with Nina and Judith, the culprit's probably<br/>going through several layers to cover up the real<br/>origin point of the note.")
('Van', "That makes trackin' 'em down incredibly tricky.")
('Aaron', "Slippery bastard. They can't make it easy on us,<br/>can they?")
('Agnès', 'Are Saara and Shaheena going to be okay?')
('Agnès', 'I really think you two should talk to the guild<br/>about this.')
('Risette', 'I agree. I am sure they will give your case priority<br/>attention since it involves a civilian in danger.')
('Risette', 'I imagine that any fees they would charge for their<br/>services would be quite nominal, too.')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "I don't know about that...")
('Van', 'Huh?')
('Shaheena', "C'mon, you've gotta do something, Saara! This really<br/>creeps me out!")
('Shaheena', "I hate to suggest this, but...maybe you should quit the<br/>parade, if that's the safest thing to do.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "No, I can't.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'Apparently preparations for the parade are<br/>almost complete.')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "If I pull out now, I'll probably cause a lot of trouble<br/>for the director and everyone else involved in it.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "That's what'll happen if I turn to the guild, too,<br/>isn't it?")
('Aaron', "We can't say for sure. But if things go south, I could<br/>definitely see that being the case, yeah.")
('Shaheena', 'But, Saara...')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'Van? I know this is really presumptuous of me to<br/>ask, but...')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', '...is this something you and your agency can handle<br/>for me?')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "Of course, I'm prepared to pay for your services.<br/>I don't expect you to do it for free.")
('Aaron', "That's real generous of you, taking on her case for<br/>cheap as an extension to what we're doing for Nina<br/>and Judith.")
('Aaron', "But don't you get the feeling she's trying to<br/>hide something?")
('Feri', 'What? She is?!')
('Agnès', "I...got that impression, too. I think there's something<br/>going on with her that we don't know about.")
('Van', "Well, a deal's a deal. Whatever it is, we already<br/>promised we'd help her.")
('Van', 'Plus for all we know, this might turn up some<br/>new leads. Following this could be a good idea.')
('Risette', 'As a first step, would you like me to pinpoint which<br/>company was responsible for delivering the note?')
('Van', "Wouldn't hurt to know, for sure. In the meantime, we<br/>need to go to the Entertainment District.")
('Van', "The other ladies are waiting for us at the hotel.<br/>We need to fill them in on everything that's<br/>happened, including this new note.")
('System', 'With the excitement having died down, the party said<br/>their goodbyes, bringing their first day in Tharbad to<br/>a close.')
('System', 'The group made a beeline straight back to the inn.')
('System', "After a full day in addition to such a long drive,<br/>everyone's exhaustion was quickly catching up<br/>to them.")
('System', "An early night's rest was in order so as to get ready to<br/>resume their investigation the next day. Or so<br/>it seemed...")
('Aaron', "What're you talking about? The night's still young!")
('Aaron', "The girls might be passing out soon, but who's to say<br/>we can't stay up and have a little after dark fun, huh?")
('Van', "Kid, I envy your energy. Haven't given up on that<br/>nightclub near the casino, huh?")
('Van', "I'm tempted to just let you loose and tell you to go<br/>have fun on your own.")
('Van', "But I do that, and I have a feelin' you'll burn half the<br/>town down. I'll tag along as your chaperone.")
('Aaron', "Hell yeah, that's the spirit! And c'mon—don't act like<br/>you weren't totally down to clown.")
('Van', 'Oh, shut it. You gotta act respectable when you get to<br/>be my age.')
('Risette', 'When do you think you two will be back?')
('Aaron', 'GUAH! Where the hell did you come from?!')
('Van', "We'll make sure we're back before midnight. If you<br/>could keep the girls distracted for me while<br/>we're gone, I'd appreciate it.")
('Risette', 'As you wish, Mr. Arkride. Enjoy your night, you two.')
(500, 'October 6th, 8:05AM')
('Agnès', '...')
('Van', 'Come on, girls, no need to sulk. Your breakfasts are<br/>gonna get cold.')
('Van', 'I mean, get a load of this hummus! This stuff is<br/>something else.')
('Agnès', "I'm not...mad.")
('Agnès', "I'm glad you two were able to have fun by yourselves<br/>last night.")
('Feri', "You should've said something. How am I supposed to<br/>protect you if you sneak out like that?")
('Van', 'Err...')
('Aaron', "Look who's in for it now! So much for our trip<br/>staying a secret.")
('Risette', 'My sincerest apologies, Mr. Arkride. It is my fault for<br/>not maintaining the façade.')
('Van', "Eh, it's not your fault. You did your best.")
('Van', "Hell of a time to have that Genesis go off, that's<br/>for sure.")
('Aaron', "From the sound of it, it lit up right around the time<br/>we were catching up with everyone's favorite<br/>phantom thief, yeah?")
('Agnès', 'R-Right, although the timing of it may have just been<br/>a coincidence.')
('Agnès', 'I was really scared something had happened to<br/>you two!')
('Van', 'Yeah, I get it. I beefed it, big time.')
('Van', "But seeing as Mare-Bear was nowhere to be found,<br/>it's not as though the situation was the same<br/>as before.")
('Risette', 'Indeed. Perhaps that suggests there are multiple<br/>response patterns that can trigger it.')
('Aaron', "Still, who would've guessed it was HER all along?<br/>Did you have any idea, small fry?")
('Feri', 'Uh, yeah, pretty much. She moves just like in that<br/>movie, so...')
('Agnès', '...?')
('Risette', 'Excuse me, just like what movie?')
('Van', "Never mind that. It doesn't matter right now.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "Hi, everyone. I hope you've had a good morning.")
('Agnès', 'Oh, hello, Saara. Good morning!')
('Van', 'Already out and about this early, huh?')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'Yes. I have a meeting to attend over at Vegas Films.')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "They say we're really going to have to rush to get me<br/>ready for the parade.")
('Shaheena', "And I'm coming along to listen to every word they<br/>have to say, 'cause I'M her manager!")
('Shaheena', "Maybe with a little luck, I'll get to meet Nina Fenly<br/>and Judith Lanster!")
('Aaron', 'Sounds like an ulterior motive to me.')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "I didn't ask you to tag along, you know.<br/>They're probably going to yell at you and ask you<br/>to leave.")
('Shaheena', "I wouldn't be so sure! I think that director's gonna fall<br/>head over heels for me, too!")
('Shaheena', "I can see it now! 'Shaheena, sweetheart! You're a<br/>once-in-a-generation find! You've got what it takes to<br/>be the next great star!'")
('Shaheena', "Aaah, I've gotta figure out what I'm gonna say when<br/>that happens! I can't go in unprepared!")
('Agnès', "Ahaha. Well, fingers crossed. Good to see you're still<br/>full of energy, Shaheena.")
('Feri', "Knowing Gotti, I don't think that's really out of<br/>the question!")
('Van', "Hey, you'll never know unless you try. Still, I have to<br/>imagine this parade's not going to be like your<br/>normal dancin'.")
('Van', "With any luck, this opportunity could open some real<br/>doors for you. Big doors, I'd think.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'Thanks, Van. I think so, too. Wish me luck!')
('Agnès', '...')
('Shaheena', 'Hey, is it just me or does something feel a little...<br/>different between the two of you?')
('Shaheena', "Wait, ohwowiewow! Is HE the boyfriend you've been<br/>seeing at night? He is, isn't he?!")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'Sha-hee-naaa!')
('Van', "Nah, I'm afraid not. We all just met<br/>yesterday, remember?")
('Shaheena', 'Oh, yeah! Oopsies.')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', '*sigh* Sorry about that. She gets ahead of<br/>herself sometimes.')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'Good luck with your work today, everyone. I hope<br/>everything goes well for you—and not just when it<br/>comes to my request, either.')
('Shaheena', "...You SURE it's not him? Now I'm even<br/>more suspicious.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'Extraordinarily sure. Come on, we have to go.')
('Van', "...What? Don't tell me you guys think it's<br/>actually true.")
('Van', 'I already explained to you what we were doing<br/>last night.')
('Agnès', 'Yeah, I know, but...still...')
('Risette', "Heehee. That's Mr. Arkride. Ever the ladykiller.")
('Feri', 'Huh? When did Van kill ladies?')
('Aaron', "Heh, you'll get it later on, kid.")
('Feri', 'Shut up! Come on, tell me!')
('Van', 'And here we go again...')
('Agnès', "Ahem. Getting back to the topic at hand, we do need<br/>to figure out what's going on with these<br/>threatening notes.")
('Agnès', "Especially now that Saara's gotten one, too.")
('Van', "Right. This being the day before the festival, this'll<br/>probably be when things start to pick up.")
('Van', "You've got to figure something's bound to turn up as<br/>long as we keep sniffin' around.")
('Van', "Which is exactly what we're going to do. Let's hunt<br/>for more 4SPGs, but keep your eyes peeled.<br/>Don't lose sight of why we're really here.")
('Agnès', 'Right! Of course!')
('Feri', 'Roger!')
('Risette', 'You have my full support as always, Mr. Arkride.')
('System', 'After that, Fie reconvened with Van and the others to<br/>exchange information.')
(500, 'October 6th, 4:05PM')
('Fie', 'Okay, I think I more or less understand what<br/>happened now...')
('Fie', 'Even if I get the impression you all are leaving out<br/>some details.')
('Agnès', 'Well...')
('Van', 'We could say the same about you, Sylphid.')
('Van', 'Like how you and none other than the prince of<br/>Elsaim are chummy with one another.')
('Fie', "Fair enough. There's nothing to really hide, so no<br/>harm in explaining.")
('Fie', "He's just someone I met through this musician<br/>I know.")
('Van', '...Ah, I follow you. Now it adds up.')
('Risette', "I've heard stories about him before. I see his influence<br/>hasn't waned.")
('Agnès', "('Musician'? Who is she talking about?)")
('Van', "Anyway, what's the guild's perspective on all of this?")
('Van', "Not just what happened here, but everything that's<br/>gone down since Messeldam.")
('Fie', "We're all in agreement that A is almost definitely<br/>involved in what's going on, Zin and the<br/>others included.")
('Fie', "Even putting aside what you're looking for, the<br/>presence of that sketchy puppeteer and that angel of<br/>hers suggests as much.")
('Fie', 'That, as well as the attempt at making it look like a<br/>case of contaminated drugs and the type of plant used<br/>to achieve that.')
('Van', "That's what I think, too. But aside from that girl and<br/>her angel, there's a distinct lack of any of their<br/>presence in Tharbad.")
('Van', "From what I can tell, none of their members or even<br/>any run-of-the-mill gangsters are lurkin' around.<br/>That's awful suspicious, if you ask me.")
('Agnès', "Yes, that's not like what happened in Langport at all.")
('Agnès', 'I assume Messeldam was also different?')
('Risette', "Correct. Messeldam was previously their stronghold,<br/>and we've confirmed that there were individuals there<br/>who enjoyed their support.")
('Risette', "It's very likely that they either masqueraded as<br/>anti-immigrant forces, or at least took advantage of<br/>the terrorism to carry out what they did.")
('Fie', "Meanwhile, we've got contaminated drugs spreading<br/>beneath the surface here, with not so much as a street<br/>thug to be found.")
('Fie', 'What do you make of that, Mr. Arkride?')
('Van', "At this point, all we're doing is just spitballin' and<br/>throwin' ideas around, aren't we?")
('Agnès', 'Maybe so, but I have a theory. Hear me out.')
('Agnès', "In order for contaminated drugs to flow into<br/>Tharbad, you'd need organizational support of<br/>SOME sort to pull it off.")
('Agnès', 'If we assume that there really are no high-ranking<br/>members or any gangsters in the city right now...')
('Agnès', '...then a local business might have the power and<br/>influence to achieve that. Something the size of<br/>Vegas Films or similar.')
('Agnès', 'Of course, the police and guild are both also probably<br/>big enough, too.')
('Agnès', "Uh, just to be clear, I'm only speaking<br/>hypothetically here! I'm not saying either of them are<br/>behind it!")
('Agnès', "Oh, what am I saying? I can't believe I'm even<br/>doubting either group, especially with a bracer<br/>right here! I'm so sorry...")
('Fie', "No, you're fine, don't be sorry. Surprising as it was,<br/>size-wise, you aren't wrong.")
('Fie', "I think we can rule out the local guild on this<br/>one, though. Everyone here is really busy, and they're<br/>short on staff as it is.")
('Fie', 'Likewise, the local police also seem to be innocent<br/>here, even if I was a little suspicious of them myself.')
('Van', "Is that to say you already looked into it? That's good.<br/>Saves us the trouble of doin' that ourselves.")
('Van', "Which means that out of the organizations you<br/>mentioned, there's only one suspect left.")
('Agnès', "W-Wait. You don't mean Vegas Films, do you?<br/>I know I mentioned them, but aren't they out of<br/>the question?")
('Agnès', 'I mean, it was Nina and Judith who hired us in the<br/>first place, not to mention how much the prince<br/>is involved!')
('Risette', 'No, we still cannot rule them out.')
('Risette', "For one thing, as actresses, neither Ms. Fenly nor Ms.<br/>Lanster 'belong' to Vegas Films.")
('Risette', 'Also, while it is true that the principality supports the<br/>company, their relationship dates back only the past<br/>six months.')
('Agnès', 'O-Oh. Huh...')
('Van', "It's also worth noting that the Tharbad Film Festival<br/>was planned separately from Messeldam's.")
('Van', "In fact, compared to Messeldam's, which was an<br/>institution, this one had a lot less notoriety going for<br/>it at first.")
('Van', "It was only once Messeldam's festival got canned that<br/>Tharbad's stock rose a lot the last two months.")
('Fie', 'Which does make sense, when you think about how<br/>Calvard is going through a real motion picture boom.')
('Fie', "When there's only one big film festival a year, it's<br/>only natural for movie buffs to gravitate toward it, no<br/>matter where it is.")
('Fie', "And when you're the company putting the whole<br/>thing on, you come away from that situation<br/>a winner.")
('Dingo', 'Sounds like you guys have it figured out.')
('Agnès', "Oh, hi, Dingo. How's Marielle doing?")
('Dingo', "She was so tired, she passed out as soon as we got<br/>back to the hotel. And now that I know she's safe,<br/>I'm here to return the favor.")
('Dingo', "I'll cut to the chase. The suspicions surrounding<br/>Vegas Films don't stop at the film festival.")
('Dingo', "There are rumblings they've poured huge sums of<br/>dark money into Tharbad's political and financial<br/>circles, like when they set up their HQ.")
('Dingo', 'And that money is supposedly going through less<br/>than legal channels.')
('Agnès', 'Hmm...')
('Van', "That's some serious dirt you've dug up. I take it<br/>you've got the evidence to back that up?")
('Dingo', "Basically. I'm ninety-nine percent of the way there.")
('Dingo', 'I looked into a number of syndicates, both big and<br/>small, including Heiyue, and all of them came<br/>back negative.')
('Dingo', 'All of them, that is...except for one.')
('Agnès', 'Almata.')
('Fie', "Well, that settles that debate. You're just as intrepid a<br/>reporter as I heard.")
('Dingo', "Why, thank you. I've heard good things about you,<br/>too, Miss Sylphid.")
('Dingo', "The only question left to resolve, assuming this is<br/>true, is why those threats were sent. That part<br/>doesn't square.")
('Risette', 'Indeed. One would think it would be against their<br/>best interests to put their own film festival<br/>in jeopardy.')
('Van', 'Hmm...')
('Feri', 'Van! Agnès!')
('Aaron', "You guys still at the inn? I see that bracer chick's with<br/>you, too.")
('Agnès', "What's the matter, you two?")
('Van', "Yeah. What's got your feathers ruffled?")
('Van', "I'm guessin' you got Shaheena home already?<br/>Where are you now?")
('Feri', "We're at Vegas Films!")
('Feri', 'After we dropped her off, an employee there<br/>contacted us.')
('Aaron', 'They say Saara vanished from the studio.')
('Aaron', 'Apparently, it happened while we were out in<br/>the desert.')
('Agnès', 'Wha...?')
('Van', 'She WHAT?!')
('Bermotti', 'I analyzed the plant you sweethearts found against<br/>the substance in those rioting around town, and...')
('Bermotti', "...we have a match! They're completely identical!")
('Feri', 'Oh, wow!')
('Dingo', 'Needless to say, it was found on the guys who<br/>kidnapped Marielle and that dancer.')
('Fie', 'This confirms, without a doubt, that it was an<br/>illegal drug.')
('Aaron', 'When did you...?')
('Aaron', "Hold on! How the hell are you able to go over the<br/>cops' heads and run that sort of test?")
('Bermotti', "With this fancy testing device that Van got for me<br/>after pulling some strings, that's how.")
('Kincaid', 'That would have been for nothing were it not for<br/>your knowledge of pharmacology.')
('Elaine', "That's Bermotti. He never fails to impress.")
('Bermotti', "Oh, hush, you two! I only know a little from dabbling<br/>in it back in the day, that's all. ❤")
('Agnès', 'Hey, that sounds like...')
('System', 'Orbal hookahs had exploded in popularity in Tharbad<br/>in recent days, particularly within the<br/>Entertainment District.')
('System', 'Easily obtainable by curious members of the public,<br/>the paraphernalia was sold by numerous vendors<br/>throughout the city.')
('System', 'Further testing by Bermotti and company confirmed<br/>that the substance smoked in them was indeed the<br/>illicit drug in question.')
('System', 'In response, the guild and local police decided to<br/>confiscate the devices in secret.')
('System', 'Afterwards, once things appeared to settle down<br/>around Vegas Films, Van and his cohorts returned<br/>to the inn.')
('System', 'As a precaution, Saara was placed under bracer<br/>protection for her own safety.')
('System', 'She and her sister therefore spent the night on the<br/>second floor of the local guild branch.')
(500, 'October 7th, 1:02AM')
('Shaheena', "Heehee! Wow, I can't believe we get to sleep at<br/>the guild! It's kind of exciting!")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "This isn't a game, you know.")
('Fie', 'Either way, you should get some rest. Trust me—the<br/>beds here are nice and comfy.')
('Shaheena', 'Yay! Sounds like we scored, sis!')
('Shaheena', 'Oh, crap! I need to get a change of clothes!')
('Fie', 'Want me to come with you?')
('Shaheena', "That's okay! Our house is practically around<br/>the corner. You two go on ahead!")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'Shaheena, wait!')
('Fie', 'Haha.')
('Shaheena', "Heehee. I'm so glad Saara made it out of that safe<br/>and sound.")
('Shaheena', 'Makes me wonder if Arusha brought us together with<br/>Van and his friends.')
('Shaheena', "Honestly, I wouldn't actually MIND if he dated—")
('Dantès', "Why, hello. Lovely night we're having, isn't it?")
('Shaheena', 'Huh?')
('Aaron', "Damn. This town's really coming to life now that it's<br/>the big day.")
('Feri', "Yeah! I don't know if any of the other festivals I've<br/>ever seen compare to this!")
('Van', "Seems like the information blackout on what<br/>happened with Dillon's working as intended, too.")
('Van', 'Not that I was worried with René looking after it.')
('Risette', "Between that and the orbal hookah incident, he's<br/>certainly proven to be an impressive individual.")
('Agnès', "I have mixed feelings on everything, but...I'm<br/>definitely glad to see everyone's hard work paying off.")
('Agnès', "Even if we can't rest easy just yet.")
('Van', "That we can't. There's still the Carnal Cavalcade at<br/>noon, plus the big award ceremony.")
('Van', "It's entirely possible that trouble could strike during<br/>either of those things.")
('Van', "I'm not saying we can't have fun and enjoy ourselves.<br/>Just...stay on the lookout for anything suspicious.")
('Aaron', 'Yeah, yeah, we know the drill by now.')
('Aaron', "You want us to take a stroll around town while<br/>checking for any new 4SPGs that've come in, yeah?<br/>Nothing we haven't done before.")
('Risette', 'So this is how Arkride Solutions goes about<br/>conducting its risk assessment work. I find it<br/>very interesting.')
('Agnès', "...It's going to be okay, you guys. We can put our<br/>experience from Langport to use here, too.")
('Agnès', "Also, I think we should check on Shaheena and Saara<br/>and see how they're doing.")
('Feri', "Definitely. I've been worried about Saara.<br/>Hopefully she feels better after a good night's sleep.")
('Van', "*sigh* No rest for the weary, it seems. Guess we've got<br/>a full plate for our last day in town. Let's get to<br/>work, folks.")
('Director Gotti', 'But before we begin, I have a very important<br/>announcement to make.')
('Director Gotti', 'Some of you may have heard rumors going around...')
('Director Gotti', 'Last night, Gaspard Dillon, CEO of Vegas Films,<br/>sadly passed away unexpectedly.')
('Director Gotti', "I'm not at liberty to disclose what took place. I'm sure<br/>more details will be revealed at a later date.")
('Director Gotti', 'Now, I understand that some people may object to us<br/>moving forward with the festival.')
('Director Gotti', 'However! Gaspard was a man of his industry.<br/>He wanted this event to succeed as much as anyone!')
('Director Gotti', "That's why we've decided to proceed, to fulfill<br/>his wish. We hope you all can understand.")
('Director Gotti', 'Thank you, thank you. I appreciate it.')
('Director Gotti', 'The growth of our film industry owes a lot to the<br/>prosperity of our country in recent times.')
('Director Gotti', "There are some skeptics out there who say once the<br/>good times come to an end, we'll become divided all<br/>over again.")
('Director Gotti', "But I'm sure you all know as well as I do that when it<br/>comes to the silver screen, race, ethnicity, and<br/>nationality don't matter a bit!")
('Director Gotti', 'Everyone in the audience is equal and gets to enjoy<br/>the greatest experience we can offer!')
('Director Gotti', 'Gaspard Dillon left his dream unfulfilled, and for<br/>him, this little show business of ours will reach<br/>heights he scarcely dared to hope for!')
(40301, 'We love you, Mr. Gotti!')
(40302, "I can't wait to see your next movie!")
('Director Gotti', 'All right, enough rambling from me!')
('Director Gotti', "It's time for everyone to relax and forget their<br/>troubles! Bathe in this sea of beauty that<br/>makes even the Goddess Herself blush!")
('Director Gotti', "That's right! I'm talking about all these<br/>gorgeous girls I have with me who've<br/>descended upon Tharbad, the city of pleasure!")
('Nina', 'Okay, everyone! All together now!')
('Judith', 'Get ready for the ride of your lives!')
('Shaheena', 'Here we go!')
('Director Gotti', 'Let the Carnal Cavalcade begin!')
(40301, 'Woooooow!')
(40302, 'This is incredible!')
(40303, "Who's that girl on stage? She wasn't on the<br/>performer list!")
('Van', "That's Salvatore Gotti for you. All he needs is a rege<br/>to dazzle you for selge.")
('Van', "Your sister's real into it, too.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "Yeah, she really is!<br/>(I'm so proud of you, Shaheena. You worked hard<br/>for this!)")
('Van', 'How are things on your end?')
('Shaheena', 'Ungh...')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'Shaheena!')
(40315, 'H-Huh?')
(40302, 'What...happened to us?')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'Shaheena! Are you okay?!')
('Shaheena', 'Saara...? What...?')
('Shaheena', 'Wh-What...have I done...?!')
('Shaheena', "I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I used Mom's dances all wrong...<br/>So many people are hurt because...because of...!")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'Shaheena, snap out of it!')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "The show still has to go on, silly. The parade isn't<br/>over yet.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "Let's finish what we both started...")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "...and show everyone's who's supported us just how<br/>bright our future is. All right?")
('Shaheena', 'Saara...')
(40615, 'Whoooa...')
(40604, "The crowd's coming together...")
('Timur', 'You can do it, girls! Go for it!')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'Is everybody watching out there?!')
('Shaheena', "Let's make this a film festival for the record books!<br/>C'mon, everyone!")
('Fie', 'What a ride this has been.')
('Fie', 'I just...hope this means things have worked out.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Eeek! This is just the sort of hot scoop I've been<br/>looking for!")
('Bermotti', "Not to burst your bubble, hon, but with the CID in<br/>town, I don't know how much anyone is going to be<br/>able to cover this event.")
('Dingo', "Maybe, but I've got a feeling readers will still get a<br/>little taste of just how hot and fiery things turned out.")
('Agnès', 'Wow, a 4SPG already.')
('Van', 'Guess Dingo got the word out about us. Good<br/>to know.')
('Aaron', "Is there really that much demand for a spriggan's<br/>services in a town like this, though?")
('Aaron', "This isn't like Langport, where Heiyue calls the shots.<br/>The bracers can operate without anyone else putting<br/>the squeeze on them, right?")
('Feri', "Yeah, actually, the Tharbad branch is right over there.<br/>There's definitely bracers around.")
('Van', "This is all true, but anywhere you go, there'll always<br/>be people with more, ah, sensitive needs who can't<br/>use bracer services easily.")
('Van', "Plus with the film festival almost here, the guild's<br/>probably short on hands and can't get to everyone<br/>who needs them.")
('Aaron', "Hah, right. Then I guess we picked a good time to<br/>show up and help those poor folks who'd otherwise<br/>fall through the cracks.")
('Van', "Exactly. But remember, we're here on a mission.<br/>We can definitely help, but don't lose track of<br/>our priorities.")
('Van', '(Hey, that table we were at yesterday is nice<br/>and open.)')
('Van', '(Maybe we should save it and then go grab some<br/>lunch from the bazaar.)')
('System', 'The main story will advance once you eat lunch.')
('System', 'Once Van and the others procured the table, they<br/>went off to the market to purchase an array of food.')
('System', 'The local cuisine they found had them smacking<br/>their lips in sheer delight.')
('System', 'Then, once their meal was over...')
('Shaheena', 'Oh, hey, guys! Morning!')
('Van', "Good to see you're brimming with energy after all<br/>that craziness yesterday.")
('Agnès', 'How are you doing, Saara? Are you holding up, too?')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'Yeah, I mostly feel fine after getting some sleep.<br/>Thanks for asking.')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "But I've decided to have Shaheena fill in for me at the<br/>parade, anyway, just to be safe.")
('Shaheena', 'Saara was just helping me put on the finishing<br/>touches to my act, as a matter of fact!')
('Feri', "You're gonna do great, Shaheena! After all that<br/>practice you put in yesterday, there's no way<br/>you won't!")
('Shaheena', "Thanks, Feri. You're right! I'm gonna go out there<br/>and blow everyone's minds!")
('Shaheena', "I'll show them a dance they won't ever forget!<br/>Believe it!")
('Aaron', "Oh, yeah? Someone's feeling fired up.")
('Shaheena', 'I mean, you saw what happened yesterday. Both me<br/>AND my sister got kidnapped, not to mention all the<br/>other stuff.')
('Shaheena', 'That had to literally be the nuttiest day of my entire<br/>life, no doubt!')
('Shaheena', "So you bet that I'm gonna make up for all that stress<br/>by making today the BEST day ever! By a long shot!")
('Shaheena', "It's gonna be so good, we won't have time to<br/>remember any of the bad stuff that's ever happened<br/>to us! Nobody will!")
('Shaheena', "But it'll only happen if I give it my all! That's why I'm<br/>so amped up!")
('Risette', "Your resolve is truly admirable. With you there, I'm<br/>sure the parade will be spectacular.")
('Shaheena', "And, Saara? I want you to know, you've got nothing<br/>to worry about.")
('Shaheena', "I can handle the spotlight. I'll shine as bright as the<br/>sun when I'm dancing on that float, just like<br/>you would!")
('Shaheena', 'Brighter than anyone else around, in fact! You can<br/>count on it!')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "Shaheena...thank you. I'll be watching from the<br/>crowd, rooting for you!")
('Van', '...')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "Also, thank you so much for looking out for us.<br/>I know we've really put you through the wringer the<br/>last few days.")
('Van', "Nah, it's all good. We took this job knowin' it might<br/>not be easy, but we'll see it through.")
('Van', "There is one thing I want to make clear, Shaheena.<br/>We've done our best to minimize any uncertainty<br/>going into today.")
('Van', "I can't promise that the film festival'll go completely<br/>without a hitch...")
('Van', "...but I can promise that, whatever happens, we'll take<br/>care of it one way or the other.")
('Van', "So don't worry about what MIGHT happen.<br/>Leave the what-ifs to us. You both go out there and<br/>live it up like you should!")
('Shaheena', 'You bet! Thanks, Van!')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "Yes, thank you, Van. Knowing you're here is<br/>so reassuring. I know I can trust you.")
('Van', "(I just hope I'm imagining things either way.)")
('Van', '(Well. All we can do is focus on the here and now.<br/>Whatever happens, happens.)')
('Prince Sherid', 'Van, everyone! Excellent timing! I was just about to<br/>come talk to all of you.')
('Agnès', "Prince Sherid! And Naje's with you, too.")
('Aaron', 'Not to mention our two favorite actresses.')
('Feri', "And even Sylphid! It's a party!")
('Van', "That's quite the crew you've got here, Your Highness.<br/>What's the occasion?")
('Nina', 'Well, His Highness invited us over.')
('Judith', 'We figured taking a bath here would be a nice way to<br/>freshen ourselves up for the parade and the<br/>awards ceremony.')
('Fie', 'As for me, I wanted to take a dip at least once while I<br/>was here, anyway, so I was hardly about to say no.')
('Prince Sherid', "But! As nice as it is to be accompanied by such lovely<br/>ladies, I'd be a bit lonely in the men's bath, so I<br/>wanted to invite you all as well.")
('Risette', 'We appreciate the offer. What do you say,<br/>Mr. Arkride? We do still have time to spare before<br/>the parade officially begins.')
('Van', "You bet we're comin' in. Wouldn't dream of missing<br/>somethin' like this.")
('Van', 'Not every day you get to rent out an entire bathhouse,<br/>after all.')
('Aaron', "You'll take just about any excuse as long as it gets you<br/>in the door, huh?")
('Agnès', "Ahaha! Well, Van's not wrong, is he?")
('Van', 'Ahhhhh... This hits the spot.')
('Van', "Somethin' about having an entire bath to yourself<br/>really just makes all your aches and pains melt away.")
('Aaron', "'Aches and pains'? Man, you are old as dirt if you're<br/>talking like that. Today's only just begun, gramps.")
('Prince Sherid', 'Haha! And yet I know exactly what Van means.')
('Prince Sherid', 'My schedule is usually more hectic than you<br/>might think. Times like this, where I can relax,<br/>unwind, and unburden, are a precious commodity.')
('Prince Sherid', "It's an opportunity to reexamine myself, inside and<br/>out, washing everything away and becoming a new<br/>me in turn.")
('Van', "See, this man here? He understands. That's exactly it,<br/>Your Highness! I've always felt that way.")
('Van', "Bathhouses definitely serve a social function, but<br/>they're first and foremost a place to engage<br/>with yourself. At least in my opinion.")
('Prince Sherid', 'Just so! With a mindset like that, I can definitely see<br/>you going far in life, Van.')
('Aaron', "Oh, great. As if one old fart in my life wasn't enough,<br/>now I get to share a bath with two of them.")
('Aaron', "Forget all that meditative shit! Let's have some fun!<br/>A little test of endurance. Who's in?")
('Van', "Didn't you hear a word I said? This is a sacred place.<br/>It's not somewhere you can just screw around and—")
('Prince Sherid', 'Actually, I quite like that idea.')
('Prince Sherid', 'Nothing like a friendly bout to bring two souls<br/>together in spiritual harmony!')
('Aaron', "I dunno about spiritual whatever, but at least I've got<br/>a taker. What about you? Too scared to take me?")
('Aaron', "Not that I blame you when it's clear as day which of<br/>us has more stamina.")
('Van', "Don't get so full of yourself, kid! All right, you want<br/>to play, I'll play.")
('Prince Sherid', 'Excellent! Finally, an opportunity to settle our<br/>unfinished business from back at the Sandsea.')
('Risette', 'As ever, I can hear our mighty men getting rowdy on<br/>the other side.')
('Judith', "Oh, for the love of... 'Men,' my foot. They might<br/>as well be a bunch of kids.")
('Naje', "*sigh* I'm going to have to report this to His<br/>Highness' sister later.")
('Judith', "Probably for the best. She at least sounds like she's<br/>got her act together. Glad someone out there can<br/>make a dent in him.")
('Nina', 'Speaking of someone making a dent, Judith...')
('Nina', "I noticed you've warmed up to Van and his assistants.<br/>How did that happen?")
('Judith', "A-Are you out of your mind?! Exactly how do I look<br/>like I've 'warmed up' to them?!")
('Nina', "Heehee! It's just a feeling I have.")
('Judith', "Oh, shut up! Don't give me that<br/>cheeky smile-and-a-giggle!")
('Fie', "So that's what happened to Aida... Thanks for filling<br/>me in. I really appreciate it.")
('Fie', "Your boss told me a little about it before, but I'm still<br/>glad I got to hear it from your side as well.")
('Fie', "Even after reading the guild report and talking to<br/>Alvis about it, something about it just didn't add up.")
('Fie', 'Sounds like she was an amazing woman right to the<br/>very end.')
('Feri', 'Yeah, she was. I really admired her...')
('Fie', 'I was really hoping to get together with her, Xeno,<br/>and Leo one of these days.')
('Fie', "It's not enough to lose the boss. She had to up and<br/>go, too, I guess.")
('Feri', "I'm sorry, Fie.")
('Fie', "No, it's okay. I'm sorry for getting all gloomy there.<br/>Besides, it wasn't all loss for either of us.")
('Feri', 'Huh? What do you mean?')
('Fie', 'Well, she was something of an older sister to both of<br/>us, yeah?')
('Fie', "That gives us a personal connection, and now we're<br/>coming together because of it.")
('Fie', "I don't know about you, but I feel like what we have<br/>could turn into something special.")
('Feri', "Yeah, you're right... Same here!")
('Feri', 'Aida talked about you, too, you know. I think she<br/>also wanted to see you again.')
('Feri', "I can't imagine this is how she ever thought we would<br/>meet up.")
('Feri', "But I'm so glad we got to talk! This has been great!")
('Fie', "I'm glad you think so, too.")
('Fie', "I...know I'm no replacement for Aida. And I don't<br/>wanna be, either.")
('Fie', "But I am a former jaeger. From what I've seen, I get<br/>the feeling our combat styles line up pretty well.")
('Fie', "So if you ever have any questions on stuff, just ask.<br/>I'll be more than happy to talk.")
('Feri', "Really? That'd be awesome! Thanks, Fie!")
('Feri', 'In that case, can I ask you something right now?')
('Fie', 'Sure. What is it?')
('Feri', "You see, there's something that's been bothering me<br/>ever since we came in here.")
('Feri', "All the other girls are—what's something Aaron<br/>would say? 'Packing heat,' or something like that?")
('Feri', 'How can I be like all of them?')
('Fie', "Okay, that's about the last thing I was expecting you<br/>to ask...")
('Feri', "I'm sorry. Do you think there's no hope for me?")
('Fie', "Well, it's true that Nina and Judith are really<br/>beautiful, and the other girls are easy on the eyes, too.")
('Fie', "Still, I don't think you've got anything to worry about.<br/>You've still got a lot of time to grow. You'll get there.")
('Feri', 'You really think so?')
('Fie', 'Think so? I know so. I used to be pretty similar to you<br/>until I had a growth spurt right around the time I<br/>turned eighteen.')
('Agnès', 'Hey, you two! Mind if I join you?')
('Agnès', 'Aaaaaah...')
('Feri', 'Oooh, I hope I grow up to be just like Agnès one day!')
('Fie', 'Hmm...')
('Fie', 'Quick question, Agnès: you go to Aramis, yeah?')
('Agnès', "Yes, I'm a first year there.")
('Fie', "Dang, a first year and you're already...like that.<br/>You remind me of a certain class president I knew.")
('Agnès', 'A...class president? Why?')
('Fie', "It's nothing, really.")
('Fie', 'Anyway, Feri, getting back to our discussion...')
('Fie', "Truth be told, it's also important to know your limits<br/>and recognize you won't have everything others do.<br/>It's part of being an adult.")
('Feri', "That's not what you said before!")
('Agnès', 'Uh, what are you two talking about?')
('Feri', "Forget it. It's got nothing to do with you.")
('Fie', "I can't even begin to imagine what it's like having the<br/>things that you do.")
('Agnès', 'H-Huh? Why do I suddenly feel like the odd<br/>one out?')
('Van', 'Urgh! How could I lose to a punkass like him?')
('Aaron', 'Guess your age is catching up to you, huh, gramps?')
('Van', 'I wish I could say you were wrong, but...but...!')
('Prince Sherid', 'Well, I, for one, had a fine time, even if I was the first<br/>one to lose.')
('Prince Sherid', "Thank you for joining me, both of you. We'll have to<br/>do this again sometime, this communing as men!")
('Aaron', 'Buddy, if you wanna commune as men, I know some<br/>good monasteries of the night, if you catch my drift.')
('Prince Sherid', 'That sounds like a grand idea! Count me in!')
('Naje', 'Your Highness, I urge you to consider your position<br/>before making such commitments.')
('Prince Sherid', 'Ahem. Pardon me. I was merely kidding, of course.<br/>Yes.')
('Aaron', "Heh. No problem. We'll have to be sneaky to make<br/>sure you don't get caught by your<br/>scary-ass bodyguard.")
('Van', "Don't give the guy any ideas! I really wouldn't push<br/>your luck when it comes to that woman.")
('Nina', 'Heehee. For as silly as those guys can be, at least they<br/>seem to be having fun.')
('Agnès', "True, but I don't know if we should be especially<br/>happy about it in this case...")
('Judith', "Anyway, I think we're going to chill here a little<br/>longer before we head out.")
('Judith', "We're counting on you guys to get us through the<br/>parade and everything else. Don't let us down.")
('Van', "Not to worry. With us on security, everything's<br/>under control. You two ladies just focus on puttin' on<br/>a good show.")
('Agnès', "An archaeologist wants our help? That's interesting.")
('Van', "I got a hunch he's not the only one tryin' to reach out.<br/>Let's check the bulletin board in the Entertainment<br/>District, too.")
('Feri', 'That should be every bulletin board, right?')
('Van', 'Yep. This is the perfect load for us to have right now.')
('Van', "We should definitely do a little work. It'll be a good<br/>opportunity to hunt for more intel.")
('Van', "Let's take care of at least one of these requests and<br/>then go from there.")
('Van', "Hey there. We're with Arkride Solutions. You the<br/>manager lookin' for some help?")
('Manager Fazil', 'I am! You folks sure turned up quick.')
('Manager Fazil', 'My name is Fazil. I oversee the bazaar here in the<br/>Cultural District.')
('Manager Fazil', 'Not to be rude, but do you mind if I cut to the chase<br/>and explain what I need?')
('Van', 'By all means, take it away.')
('Manager Fazil', "Thank you. As I wrote in my post, we've been having<br/>problems with a young girl who routinely steals from<br/>the stalls here.")
('Manager Fazil', "I've been able to look the other way until now, but<br/>unfortunately, it's starting to get out of hand.")
('Manager Fazil', "Some say I should just turn her in to the police or<br/>guild, but I'd rather not do anything that drastic.<br/>I mean...I've seen her. She's a kid.")
('Manager Fazil', 'I was hoping you folks could wrangle her up for me so<br/>I can sit down and talk to her—try and work<br/>something out.')
('Van', "That's all you want us to do?")
('Van', "If that's the case, you really could just talk to<br/>the guild. I'm sure a bracer would be happy to<br/>help you.")
('Manager Fazil', "I can see why you would think that, but I'm just<br/>interested in helping her. I don't want her to get<br/>in trouble.")
('Manager Fazil', "The bracers, being who they are, would likely feel<br/>compelled to come down on her if they knew how<br/>much she's stolen.")
('Manager Fazil', "That's why I thought you and your team might be my<br/>best option. You don't need to deal in absolutes the<br/>way everyone else does.")
('Aaron', 'For a guy running a business org, you sure are being<br/>lenient with such a big-time shoplifter.')
('Aaron', 'What gives? Why do you want to give this girl a pass?')
('Manager Fazil', "It's hard to admit these days...but it's a fair question.")
('Manager Fazil', 'You see, when I was her age, I was also destitute and<br/>made ends meet by stealing whatever I could.')
('Manager Fazil', "I was lucky enough to eventually find a job that let me<br/>earn an honest living. I shudder to think what<br/>would've become of me if I hadn't.")
('Manager Fazil', 'I see a lot of myself in that girl...and want to give her<br/>a second chance.')
('Aaron', 'Sure, I get you. Still awful generous of you.')
('Van', 'Okay, I think we have a good grasp of the situation.<br/>I can understand why you felt it was best to come<br/>to us.')
('Agnès', "Does that mean we're going to take this job?")
('Van', 'You bet we are.<br/>(Only question is whether to start right now<br/>or save it for later.)')
('Manager Fazil', "I still need your help dealing with the shoplifter who's<br/>been stealing things from sellers in my bazaar.")
('Manager Fazil', 'Would you be able to bring her over to me so I can sit<br/>down and try to work something out with her?')
('Van', "(He's already explained why he can't ask anyone else<br/>to do this job. Should we go ahead and get started?)")
('Van', "Hate to do this, but can you hold off on gettin'<br/>started until just a little later?")
('Manager Fazil', "That's okay. I know you might have other things to<br/>do first. I'll be here whenever you're ready.")
('Van', "We're good to go. Let's hammer out a plan of attack.")
('Van', "Once we've found her, we'll get in touch with you.<br/>Sound good?")
('Manager Fazil', 'Very much so! Thank you for agreeing to help.')
('Manager Fazil', "I'm going to get back to work now. But if you folks<br/>need anything, let me know. I'll drop everything<br/>to help.")
('Van', 'Now, with that settled, first thing we need to do is<br/>gather some more information about our little thief.')
('Agnès', 'We should speak to some of the merchants and find<br/>out what their experience with her has been like.')
('Van', "Definitely. Might not be the worst idea to check in at<br/>the guild and do a little askin' around about<br/>her, either.")
('Van', "From the sound of things, it wouldn't surprise me if<br/>they have at least some idea of what's going on.")
('Feri', "That's true. If she's been stealing lots, they might<br/>know some stuff.")
('Aaron', "In that case, might as well hit up the temple while<br/>we're at it.")
('Aaron', "I don't know what Tharbad's is like, but you'd think<br/>they take in orphans.")
('Aaron', "They probably go out on patrols looking for 'em, too.<br/>If this thief's an orphan, they might know about her.")
('Van', "Good thinkin'. That's three stops on our tour, then:<br/>the bazaar, the guild branch, and the temple.")
('Van', "That's a good amount of people to talk to, but no<br/>need to rush. Just take your time and do it right.<br/>Ready to roll?")
('Agnès', "Okay! Let's see what we can find out!")
('System', 'Quest Bazaar Burglar started!')
('Monir', 'Oh, I know the girl you must be talking about.')
('Monir', 'She sneaks into my shop all the time.')
('Feri', "How often would you say she tries to steal stuff from<br/>you, ma'am?")
('Aaron', "And how much, too? That'd be good to know.")
('Monir', "Let me think... I'd say she comes here about every<br/>other day.")
('Monir', "She never takes a lot. She's just a child—she can only<br/>carry so much.")
('Aaron', "So you know for a fact that you're dealing with<br/>a loner? She's not in any kind of gang or anything<br/>like that?")
('Monir', "No, I've never seen her working with anybody else.<br/>She's always by herself.")
('Monir', 'To be honest, I do feel for her. You hate to see<br/>someone so young live like that.')
('Monir', 'Hopefully either the police or the temple can take her<br/>in soon and give her the help she needs.')
('Van', "That's what we're trying to make happen, ma'am.<br/>Thanks for talking to us. You've been a big help.")
('Agnès', "Phew, I think that's finally all of the places we wanted<br/>to visit.")
('Feri', "Yeah, let's go back to the bazaar and go over<br/>everything we heard.")
('Jaret', "Oh, yeah. I know the girl you're looking for, all right.<br/>She's in here constantly.")
('Jaret', 'Last I saw her was two days ago, I think.')
('Feri', "Wow, that's really recent!")
('Jaret', "She looked desperate. You can tell she's going<br/>through a real rough patch. Her clothes are filthy.")
('Jaret', "I can't not help a kid who's clearly just trying to...<br/>survive, you know?")
('Jaret', "So, the trick is, I make some food for her, and she<br/>gets to 'steal' it.")
('Aaron', "Awfully generous for someone who's been targeted<br/>by her. You don't think she should be apprehended<br/>or something?")
('Jaret', "Don't get me wrong, it'd be better for everyone if she<br/>stopped stealing from my shop!")
('Jaret', "Last thing I need is word getting around that I'm<br/>some kind of easy mark and more organized thieves<br/>getting ideas.")
('Jaret', "But I don't have the heart to stand there and watch a<br/>little girl starve right in front of me, so I try to do<br/>what I can.")
('Jaret', 'Take good care of her when you find her, okay?<br/>I trust the bazaar manager will come up<br/>with something.')
('Agnès', "Of course! We're all on the same team. Thank you for<br/>talking to us.")
('Agnès', "Phew, I think that's finally all of the places we wanted<br/>to visit.")
('Feri', "Yeah, let's go back to the bazaar and go over<br/>everything we heard.")
('Rasham', "Looking for that infamous little thief, huh?<br/>I've definitely heard people talk about her.")
('Rasham', "Can't say she's come to pay me a visit, though.")
('Rasham', "Knowing Fazil, he probably doesn't want to press<br/>charges on her, right?")
('Rasham', "Between you, me, and the post, I think that's going<br/>too easy on her.")
('Aaron', 'Honestly, I think so, too.')
('Rasham', "The way I figure, if there are no consequences for<br/>what she's done, then she'll grow up to be<br/>completely amoral.")
('Rasham', "Not that I'm one to talk. I'm not the best role<br/>model, either.")
('Van', 'Well, we still appreciate what you had to share.<br/>Thanks, buddy.')
('Agnès', "Phew, I think that's finally all of the places we wanted<br/>to visit.")
('Feri', "Yeah, let's go back to the bazaar and go over<br/>everything we heard.")
('Balsheh', "You're asking about that shoplifter?")
('Balsheh', "Yes, I've heard of her. She's never been to my stall,<br/>however, so I don't know much about her.")
('Balsheh', 'A bracer actually asked me something similar earlier.<br/>I wonder what happened to her after that...')
('Feri', 'You said a bracer talked to you? What did they ask?')
('Balsheh', 'It was a while back, but I believe they were<br/>investigating how much damage she had caused.')
('Balsheh', 'Personally, I have a really hard time seeing such a<br/>young girl struggling so badly.')
('Balsheh', 'I pray that someone, be it a bracer or whoever, finds<br/>her and gets her the help she needs.')
('Agnès', "I absolutely agree, ma'am. Thank you for your time.")
('Feri', '(Sounds like the guild has been looking into<br/>this, too.)')
('Van', '(Sure does. All the more reason for us to go and pay a<br/>visit to the local branch and see what we can learn.)')
('Agnès', "Phew. I think that's finally all of the places we wanted<br/>to visit.")
('Feri', "Yeah, let's go back to the bazaar and go over<br/>everything we heard.")
('Receptionist Jibril', "Yes, that's right. We're aware of a thief in the area.")
('Receptionist Jibril', 'One of our bracers said they managed to catch a<br/>glimpse of her previously.')
('Receptionist Jibril', "But they haven't seen hide nor hair of her while<br/>patrolling the city since.")
('Van', "So the guild's on the lookout for her. That's good<br/>to know.")
('Feri', 'Sounds like it could be pretty tough to find her...')
('Agnès', 'Do you mind if we ask if the guild has a plan for what<br/>to do with her if you find her again?')
('Receptionist Jibril', 'Initially, we were planning to take her into custody,<br/>of course.')
('Receptionist Jibril', 'But Fazil and some of the merchants asked us not to<br/>be too harsh with her.')
('Receptionist Jibril', "So, for the time being, we've been hands off about it.")
('Aaron', "That's pretty much what Fazil told us, too. That he'd<br/>rather settle it privately.")
('Receptionist Jibril', "Which is fair. If the merchants want to try and<br/>resolve it themselves, we can't butt in.")
('Receptionist Jibril', 'I hope that answers your question. Good luck with<br/>your search.')
('Van', "Thanks. We've got our way of figurin' these<br/>things out. We'll make it work.")
('Agnès', "Phew, I think that's finally all of the places we wanted<br/>to visit.")
('Feri', "Yeah, let's go back to the bazaar and go over<br/>everything we heard.")
('Feri', "Well, time to find someone else to talk to! Let's go!")
('Vicar Mukhtar', "A serial shoplifter around the bazaar? Yes, I've heard<br/>about her.")
('Vicar Mukhtar', "In fact, I've sent people into the bazaar to try and<br/>look for her.")
('Vicar Mukhtar', "If this young girl is committing crimes because she<br/>has nowhere else to go, it's our duty to take her in and<br/>give her refuge.")
('Agnès', "That's so kind of you. How did the search go?")
('Vicar Mukhtar', "One person did manage to see her, but only once.<br/>She's vanished into the ether since.")
('Vicar Mukhtar', "It pains me to think we aren't able to help her.")
('Vicar Mukhtar', 'If only we could find her and at least talk to her about<br/>her circumstances... Alas.')
('Feri', "Wow, she must be pretty determined if she's trying<br/>that hard not to get caught.")
('Feri', 'Thanks for talking to us, Father. We really<br/>appreciate it!')
('Agnès', "Phew, I think that's finally all of the places we wanted<br/>to visit.")
('Feri', "Yeah, let's go back to the bazaar and go over<br/>everything we heard.")
('Agnès', 'Okay, shall we find someone else to ask about her?')
('Van', "All right, I think we've dug up about as much as we're<br/>going to find.")
('Van', 'Based on what we know, we can probably assume this<br/>girl has no friends or family...none living, anyway.')
('Van', 'She seems to live on her own and looks after herself,<br/>and no one else.')
('Aaron', "And she's pretty damn good at swiping stuff.")
('Aaron', 'Takes skill to avoid getting noticed by people from<br/>both the guild and temple, outside of that handful<br/>of times.')
('Agnès', "Which means it's not going to be easy to find her.")
('Feri', "Don't worry! You've got me, remember? I'm sure if<br/>we work together, we can nab her!")
('Van', "One would hope. She might be better than average,<br/>but we are still dealin' with a kid here. It shouldn't<br/>be impossible.")
('Van', 'Right. Now that we know the score, we should try<br/>setting up a stakeout.')
('Van', "She doesn't know we're lookin' for her, so with any<br/>luck, she might come out of hiding if we wait<br/>long enough.")
('Aaron', "You really think, dude? How the hell do we know<br/>she's even going to show up today, let alone when?")
('Agnès', "We don't. But two of the shopkeepers we talked to<br/>did mention that they last saw her two days ago.")
('Agnès', "Enough time has passed that she might need to come<br/>out and 'forage' again. I think it's worth a try.")
('Van', "That's my opinion, too. As for where we'll set up<br/>shop, let's talk to the stall owners who saw her before.")
('Van', 'With any luck, we can all work together.')
('Monir', 'Oh, nice to see you all again. Is there something I can<br/>do for you?')
('Jaret', 'We meet again. Need something else?')
('Van', "Yeah. It's about that shoplifter we mentioned earlier.")
('Van', "There's somethin' we wanted to discuss with you and<br/>the other owner across the street. Could you come<br/>with me?")
('Monir', "Sure, I don't mind.")
('Jaret', 'Yeah, no problem.')
('System', 'Van and the others split up to talk to each of<br/>the shopkeepers.')
('System', 'They explained their plan to try and catch<br/>the shoplifter.')
('Van', '...Basically, knowing what we do now, we want to set<br/>up a stakeout within the bazaar and see if she<br/>turns up.')
('Van', 'Would you two mind if we hid inside your shops to<br/>keep an eye out?')
('Monir', "Oh, go right ahead. You'll be doing us a favor if you<br/>manage to capture her, if anything.")
('Jaret', 'Yeah, what she said. Plus the manager hired you guys.<br/>Of course we trust you, and would be happy to work<br/>with you.')
('Agnès', "Thank goodness! We're glad you understand.<br/>Thank you both so much.")
('Van', "Okay, with that settled, let's split up and get to work.")
('Van', 'Agnès and Ferida, you take one stall.')
('Van', "You, punk, are stickin' with me. We'll set up shop in<br/>the other stall.")
('Aaron', "Hope you don't regret bringing me along, chief.<br/>Now you have to deliver and show me how good<br/>you are.")
('Agnès', "We've got this, Feri!")
('Feri', "Yeah, we'll catch her, no sweat!")
('Agnès', 'That girl over there... Could she be the one?')
('Feri', 'She does look really cautious of her surroundings, like<br/>a thief would when scoping a place out.')
('Agnès', "(She's SO small. It's sad she has to steal so much in<br/>order to survive...)")
('Aaron', "Hey, she's coming this way.")
('Van', "That works out nicely for us. Once we see her steal<br/>something, we'll close in and nab her.")
(40301, "...Well, that's all the shopping I need done for today.")
(40301, 'On a different note, the film festival sure has brought<br/>an awful lot of people into town.')
(40301, "This place already gets hot. Now it's going to feel<br/>stuffy everywhere you go because of all the crowds!<br/>Ah, what a bother...")
('Monir', "Haha. Maybe so, but I certainly can't complain about<br/>having more customers. I'm happy they're here.")
('Sinem', '...')
('System', 'The pickpocket slipped an apple into her bag when<br/>she thought nobody was looking.')
('Van', "Dang, kid, you really are as smooth with your hands<br/>as I've been led to believe.")
('Sinem', 'Urgh!')
('Van', "There's no need to be scared. We're what you might<br/>call 'problem solvers.' We're not here to turn you over<br/>to the cops or anything like that.")
('Van', "We just wanna talk for a bit, that's all. Like it or not,<br/>we need you to come with us.")
('Sinem', '...')
('System', 'With a quick feint, the girl managed to sneak straight<br/>past Van.')
('Van', 'Hey!')
('Aaron', "How's it feel letting a little kid give you the slip?")
('Agnès', 'Van, is everything okay?')
('Feri', 'I saw that girl run towards the inn!')
('Aaron', "Don't worry, old man—we'll clean your mess up.<br/>Let's move, girls!")
('Feri', "Gah! This street's pretty crowded. How'll we ever<br/>figure out where she went?")
('Aaron', 'That must be the idea: blend into all these people and<br/>get out unnoticed.')
('Aaron', "Hell if it's gonna work on a couple of pros like<br/>us, though!")
('Aaron', 'Got you, you little punk!')
(40301, 'Wh-What the—?!')
('Sinem', 'Hmph!')
('Aaron', 'Damn! How the hell is she so slippery?!')
('Feri', 'Did she literally just jump onto that tarp and start<br/>running on it?!')
('Van', "Oh, boy. I can already tell she's going to drag this<br/>thing out.")
('Feri', "Let me go after her next—I can handle heights<br/>just fine! I'll get her for you guys!")
('Feri', "She might be light on her feet, but she's not as light<br/>as this proud Kruga warrior!")
('Feri', 'Quit running! Stop right there!')
('Feri', 'I promise, you wanna hear what we have to<br/>say, really!')
('Sinem', '...!')
('Feri', "Aaah! Hey, don't go wasting food like that, either!")
('Feri', "Grr, I'm so embarrassed. She managed to shake me<br/>off, too!")
('Aaron', "You should've forgotten the apple and stayed on<br/>her tail! What were you thinking?")
('Feri', 'But she stole it! I thought it would be terrible for<br/>stolen food to go to waste like that.')
('Agnès', "That's really admirable of you, Feri. I think it's<br/>important to keep stuff like that in mind, too.")
('Van', 'She made a break for the Entertainment District,<br/>which might actually be a blessing in disguise.')
('Van', "That area's a lot more wide open, so she won't have<br/>nearly as many places she can slip into easily.")
('Van', "This'll be our chance to finally surround her and take<br/>her in. Everybody ready?")
('Agnès', 'For sure!')
('Manager Fazil', "All right, now that we finally get to meet, why don't<br/>you tell us your name? Can you do that?")
('Sinem', '...')
('Van', "There's no getting away now, kid. You have nothing<br/>else to lose. You might as well talk.")
('Sinem', "Mmph. My name's...Sinem.")
('Sinem', "I know it's bad to steal from the bazaar.")
('Sinem', "But I'm not sorry about it.")
('Sinem', "If I have to steal so I don't die, then I'll steal as much<br/>as I have to. Period!")
('Agnès', "That's fair, in its way. It sounds like you really don't<br/>have much of a choice.")
('Manager Fazil', "Aye, it's reasonable enough. In that case, let me ask<br/>you another question.")
('Manager Fazil', "Where's your family? How have you been living up to<br/>this point?")
('Sinem', 'My mom and I...used to live in the country.<br/>But eventually, we ran out of money, so we had to<br/>move to find work.')
('Sinem', "Ever since my mom got...got sick and died, I've<br/>been alone.")
('Sinem', 'I used to do random jobs while going from place<br/>to place.')
('Feri', "Oh, Sinem, I'm so sorry! But...you could've gone to<br/>the temple. They would've helped you!")
('Feri', "In fact, it might not be too late now! Maybe they'll<br/>still take you in.")
('Manager Fazil', "Exactly. That's what I also thought.")
('Sinem', 'Pfhah! You guys must be joking.')
('Sinem', "I'm more than just a thief, you know.")
('Sinem', "I've done all kinds of bad stuff in order to survive, like<br/>delivering sketchy packages for people.")
('Sinem', "Someone like me doesn't deserve to be taken in.")
('Aaron', "Oh, now you act all noble and mature. Some logic<br/>you've got there, kid.")
('Sinem', 'Whatever... Are we done talking now?')
('Sinem', "Just turn me over to the cops and get it over<br/>with already. You're wasting my time.")
('Manager Fazil', "No, I'm not going to turn you in. I brought these<br/>people in on this precisely to avoid that outcome.")
('Sinem', 'Huh?')
('Manager Fazil', "Now I'm not sure what to do. I was originally going<br/>to talk to the temple and ask them to look after her.")
('Manager Fazil', 'What do you think? What should I do about her?')
('Van', 'Good question. Let me think...')
('Van', '(Try as she might to resist, leaving her with the<br/>temple is still probably the safest bet.)')
('Van', '(If not that, she at least needs someone who can rein<br/>her in and set her straight. Hmm...)')
('Van', 'Truth be told, I think the Septian temple is still the<br/>best place for her to go.')
('Van', "Someone as street-hardened as she is might have<br/>trouble gettin' along with the other kids there...")
('Van', "...but if nothing else, you know she'll be in good,<br/>safe hands.")
('Manager Fazil', 'True. You make a good point.')
('Manager Fazil', "Then it's settled. I'm going to take you to the temple.<br/>It's for you own good.")
('Sinem', "Huh?! You can't just decide where I'm going to go!<br/>I don't wanna go to the temple! Anywhere but there!")
('Van', 'Anywhere, huh? If you feel that strongly about it, we<br/>really could take you down to the police station.<br/>Your choice.')
('Sinem', 'Er...')
('Aaron', 'Why the hesitation? Landed on their radar more than<br/>you care to admit?')
('Aaron', "Hell, even if you haven't, if any of those sellers report<br/>you, they'll be on your ass for sure—probably with a<br/>big, fat record to show for it.")
('Sinem', 'Argh! You grown-ups are such cowards! You<br/>always are!')
('Sinem', "You don't care about my feelings at all! You think you<br/>can look down on me just because I'm a kid and<br/>happen to be poor!")
('Manager Fazil', "That's not true. When I was young, it also felt like it<br/>was me against the world, just like you feel right now.")
('Manager Fazil', 'But you know what? I met this strange vendor who<br/>got me off the streets and taught me a great deal.')
('Manager Fazil', "That's why I know it's important to look after<br/>children and teach them what they need to know,<br/>even if you have to force it a little sometimes.")
('Manager Fazil', 'So how about this: if you agree to stay with the<br/>temple, you can come work with us at the bazaar.<br/>Would you give that a try?')
('Sinem', "Are you nuts?! You're giving me work even though<br/>you know just how much stuff I stole from<br/>you people?")
('Manager Fazil', "Oh, I know. And you'll be paying back what you stole<br/>as part of that work, too.")
('Manager Fazil', "But we'll still pay you and give you food to eat on top<br/>of that.")
('Manager Fazil', "I don't think that's such a bad deal, is it?")
('Van', "I definitely agree that with a personality like hers,<br/>she'd have a real tough time fittin' in over at<br/>the temple.")
('Van', 'Would you be open to taking her in yourself?')
('Manager Fazil', "Actually...I'd thought about that as well.")
('Manager Fazil', "We have an empty apartment we normally rent out<br/>for caravans that's going unoccupied, so she'd still<br/>have a place to stay.")
('Manager Fazil', "...You know what? I'll do it. This must be Arusha's<br/>hand at work. I'd be happy to be your guardian for a<br/>while and see where we go from there.")
('Manager Fazil', "I'll even have you come work with us in the bazaar!")
('Sinem', "Say what?! Who would want a thief working there?<br/>Especially with everything I've taken?")
('Sinem', "...Oh, I get it. You just wanna feel good about<br/>yourself for being sooo kind to some poor little girl<br/>who's down on her luck. Is that it?")
('Sinem', "If that's all you think about me, I'll stay on my own<br/>and steal to survive, thank you very much!")
('Manager Fazil', "Haha... I was once in your shoes, believe it or not.<br/>There was this nosey merchant who couldn't keep<br/>to himself.")
('Manager Fazil', 'He took me in, gave me a place to stay, taught me<br/>how to work...and eventually, I ended up in charge of<br/>the whole bazaar.')
('Manager Fazil', "I've always wanted to give something back for getting<br/>a second chance...and, yes, I see that opportunity in<br/>you, Sinem.")
('Manager Fazil', "You may think my offer is insincere—honestly,<br/>that's fair. But I think it is still the right thing to do<br/>for your situation, one way or the other.")
('Sinem', '...')
('Agnès', "It's okay. I'm sure once you talk to the stall owners<br/>and explain your situation to them, they'll let you stay.")
('Agnès', "You're going to have to be a little brave, but it's a<br/>chance to make a fresh start. I think it'll be worth it.")
('Van', "What she said. If you don't want to get too familiar<br/>with the cops, now's the time to start getting your<br/>act together.")
('Van', "It sounds like you don't exactly enjoy living the way<br/>you do, anyway, so what's the harm in taking him<br/>up on the offer?")
('Sinem', '...')
('Sinem', "*sigh* When you guys put it like that, I guess I<br/>can't refuse.")
('Sinem', "All right. I'll work in your freaking bazaar, since<br/>you insist.")
('Sinem', 'Uh, I mean...if you really want me, that is.')
('Manager Fazil', "Bahaha! Of course I do! We're happy to have<br/>you aboard!")
('Agnès', 'Phew. That solves that.')
('Van', 'Finally. That girl sure made us earn our keep.')
('Manager Fazil', "Don't I know it! Thanks for going to all that trouble.<br/>I really appreciate it.")
('Manager Fazil', "Now it's my turn to do the heavy lifting and<br/>support her.")
('Manager Fazil', "We've got a long road ahead of us, starting with<br/>getting the whole bazaar on board. But one way or<br/>another, we'll make it work.")
('Feri', 'I bet you will! Good luck, mister!')
('Manager Fazil', "Thanks! I'll never forget what you all have done for<br/>both of us!")
('System', 'Quest Bazaar Burglar completed!')
('System', 'Received')
('Aaron', 'Hey, man. Got a few seconds to talk?')
('Officer Camilo', 'Certainly! How can I help you all?')
('Van', "Yeah, we just realized we got scammed into buyin'<br/>some fake souvenirs by a street vendor we ran into.")
('Van', "We tried to demand our money back, but the guy<br/>won't hear any of it.")
('Officer Camilo', "He what?! That's outrageous! I'm so sorry you all fell<br/>victim to that.")
('Officer Camilo', 'The Tharbad Police view the rampant counterfeiting<br/>in this town as a serious problem in need<br/>of addressing.')
('Officer Camilo', "Your case deserves urgent attention from us.<br/>Rest assured, that seller won't get away with this.<br/>He WILL be brought to justice, I promise!")
('Aaron', 'Well, glad someone out here cares about the<br/>little guy.')
('Officer Camilo', "Of course! It's an officer's duty above all else to keep<br/>the people of this city safe. I'm more than happy<br/>to assist.")
('Officer Camilo', 'Tell me, where is this scam artist located?')
('Feri', "Umm, it's on the street that runs by the casino.")
('Feri', '(Oh, crap! Did I make a mistake? Should I have made<br/>something up?)')
('Van', "(No, that's okay. I think it'll all work out.)")
('Officer Camilo', "That street, huh? I've never heard of any bootleggers<br/>operating there before.")
('Officer Camilo', 'Wait! You know, I just remembered.')
('Officer Camilo', "The higher ups said that we're supposed to prioritize<br/>the film festival for now.")
('Officer Camilo', "So as much as I'd like to drop everything and<br/>investigate this seller, I'll probably have to wait to<br/>look into it another day.")
('Officer Camilo', "But don't you all worry. I'll do everything I can to<br/>make sure you folks get every mira back.")
('Agnès', "That's good to know. Thank you for listening to us.")
('Aaron', 'Cool. We look forward to hearing good news, then.')
('Van', '...')
('Aaron', "(Huh? What's his deal?)")
('Van', "All right, I think that's enough sleuthin' around<br/>for now. We got a bombshell to deal with already.")
('Feri', "We do? I mean, we talked to a bunch of people, but it<br/>sure didn't feel like we heard anything that big.")
('Aaron', "Speak for yourself. There's one part that's definitely<br/>been nagging at me.")
('Agnès', "Me, too, although I'm not certain whether it's<br/>especially significant.")
('Feri', "Whaaa—?! You're telling me I'm the only one that<br/>didn't pick up on it?! Man...")
('Van', "You'll figure it out once we check back in with the<br/>stall owner.")
('Van', "Let's head back to his place and touch base.")
('Van', "(Okay, time to hit up another cop and see what<br/>they've got to say.)")
('Van', 'Hey. Mind if we have another chat?')
('Officer Camilo', 'Oh, hello again. Is there something else I can—')
('Van', "Right, so, it's time to be real. I'm a spriggan, and<br/>these are my assistants.")
('Van', 'A concerned citizen, you see, hired us to help with a<br/>crooked cop trying to shake him down for hush<br/>money concerning his bootlegging.')
('Officer Camilo', '...')
('Officer Camilo', "That's...an interesting assignment you've been given.<br/>I fail to see what this has got to do with me, though.")
('Marcello', "Like hell you do! I'd recognize your smug face<br/>anywhere, asshole!")
('Marcello', "It's him! This is definitely the guy!")
('Marcello', "If you don't want to be put on trial for extortion,<br/>you'd better back off right now, or else!")
('Feri', 'Wh-Whoa! Take it easy, mister!')
('Officer Camilo', "I really can't understand what you're even talking<br/>about when you yell like that, sir.")
('Officer Camilo', 'If I happened to say anything to you before, then...<br/>very well, I take it back.')
('Officer Camilo', "Easy enough, right? Does that make you feel better?<br/>Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to leave. I'm really<br/>busy right now.")
('Marcello', 'Huh?!')
('Van', "What's the rush, pal? We're not done talking.")
('Van', "I don't think my client can take you at your word.<br/>Y'know, given your rampant history of lyin'.")
('Officer Camilo', "I don't understand. What else do you want from me?")
('Van', 'Well...how about you give us your full name<br/>and precinct?')
('Van', 'We can, you know, run that by the Tharbad Police<br/>and make sure you get a commendation for<br/>good service.')
('Van', "Even if you came in from a different part of the<br/>country to help out, they should still have no problem<br/>lookin' you up.")
('Officer Camilo', '...!')
('Aaron', "What's the matter? Cat got your tongue?")
('Aaron', 'You could show us your badge, too. We can look up<br/>your details, no problem. Whatever works for you.')
('Officer Camilo', "Th-This is ridiculous! I don't have to put up<br/>with this!")
('Officer Camilo', "If you keep this nonsense up, I'll arrest all of you for<br/>disturbing the peace!")
('Feri', "...Ohh, so you'll take us down to the police<br/>station, riiight?")
('Feri', "They'll know you're a fake right away if you do that,<br/>you dummy!")
('Officer Camilo', 'Little bi—')
('Marcello', 'You really are an impostor! What kind of cop talks to<br/>civilians like that, huh?!')
('Marcello', "Bastard! You'll pay for making a fool out of me!<br/>Let's go!")
('Van', "You dumbass, don't—!")
('Officer Camilo', 'Stay where you are!')
('Officer Camilo', "That's it! I tried to keep calm, but you just had to get<br/>ahead of yourself. I think it's time you shut the<br/>hell up!")
('Marcello', 'Huh?!')
('Van', 'I tried to warn you, dude!')
('Feri', "Oh, crud! We're starting to draw some<br/>serious attention!")
('Agnès', 'Everybody, please, calm down! We have the situation<br/>under control!')
('Aaron', 'Shit. Could this get any worse?')
('Van', "(He's right. I don't want this to end with the client<br/>getting stabbed.)")
('Van', "(On the one hand, I probably can't guarantee his<br/>safety unless I give up on apprehending<br/>our impostor.)")
('Van', '(On the other, this guy really seems like bad news.<br/>I can try to take him down, but we might not make it<br/>out unscathed.)')
('Van', "(The client's safety has to come first.)")
('Van', "(I've got to come up with a bluff or something to get<br/>this guy to back off, ASAP.)")
('Van', "Don't try anything stupid.")
('Van', "It won't be long before the real cops come and crash<br/>this party.")
('Van', "You seem smart. It wouldn't take much effort for<br/>people like us to apprehend your dumb ass. You do<br/>realize that, yeah?")
('Officer Camilo', 'Hmph.')
('Van', "I'll make you a deal. If you calm down and leave<br/>quietly, we'll let you go.")
('Van', 'You have to agree to leave my client alone from<br/>now on. No exceptions.')
('Van', "And if you don't and you try anything funny again?<br/>Well, you don't need us to tell you what'll happen,<br/>do you?")
('Officer Camilo', '...')
('Marcello', '...')
('Officer Camilo', "...If I find out I've been tricked, there'll be hell to pay.<br/>Understand?")
('Van', "Yeah, yeah. We're honest, unlike you. Now hurry up<br/>and get the hell out of here. We've got no deal till<br/>you're gone.")
('Officer Camilo', "Fine. I'm out of here.")
('Officer Camilo', "(I've got no choice. My brother would be pissed at me<br/>if I got thrown in jail.)")
('Van', '*sigh* Glad we made it out of that in one<br/>piece somehow.')
('Marcello', 'Ugh... I think that encounter took at least a couple<br/>years off my life.')
('Aaron', "Maybe if you hadn't gone ballistic on the guy, things<br/>would've gone more smoothly. You think about that?")
('Marcello', "Look, I'm sorry, all right? I just...got caught up in the<br/>heat of the moment.")
('Agnès', "Well, at least you're safe now. That's what<br/>matters most.")
('Feri', 'I guess that means this is case closed, huh?')
('Van', "Yeah. I think we've scared him enough that he'll<br/>think twice before trying anything again.")
('Van', "It's a shame we couldn't figure out what the dude's<br/>end game was, but at least we got the job itself done.")
('System', 'Afterward, the party addressed the crowd that had<br/>formed, glossing over the circumstances while<br/>imploring them to disperse.')
('System', "Once the commotion died down, they all returned to<br/>Marcello's stall.")
('Van', "We're taking him in! Get ready! This could<br/>get messy!")
('Officer Camilo', 'I told you, stay away!')
('Marcello', 'Aaaugh!')
('Aaron', 'Eat shit!')
('Officer Camilo', 'AAARGH!')
('Aaron', 'Heh, that all you got? You can keep fighting if<br/>you like. I enjoy a good tango.')
('Van', "You get what we're sayin'? Surrender now if you don't<br/>wanna get hurt. Now, what's it going to be?")
('Officer Camilo', 'Damn you. Guess the odds are stacked against me...')
('Feri', 'Are you all right?!')
('Agnès', "Oh, no! You're hurt! Here, let me treat you!")
('Van', 'Hey, can one of you contact the police for us?')
('Van', "Although it wouldn't shock me if they're already on<br/>their way with how much of a scene we've made.")
('Feri', 'On it!')
('System', "Before long, the police came rushing in.<br/>Once informed of the situation, they took 'Officer'<br/>Camilo into custody.")
('System', 'Soon enough, it was determined that he was one of<br/>the Devancy Brothers, who were wanted in Edith.')
('System', 'And so, the case of the extorting impostor was laid<br/>to rest.')
('System', "With the culprit now apprehended, they all made<br/>their way back to Marcello's stall.")
('Tourist', "Please, you've got to help me! Is there any chance I<br/>could see a green-haired bracer who works here?")
('Tourist', "I lost my wallet somewhere. I'm hoping if I talk to<br/>him, he might know where it could've gone.")
('Van', "Seems the receptionist's a little occupied at<br/>the moment.")
('Aaron', "This guy must be desperate if he's coming in here at<br/>this hour asking for help.")
('Risette', "Indeed. Let's watch and see what happens.<br/>Perhaps we'll learn something.")
('Receptionist Jibril', "I'm sorry, I'm going to need a little more<br/>information first. Could you explain what, exactly, is<br/>going on?")
('Tourist', 'Uhh, right, of course. Basically, I was on my way to<br/>Tharbad, driving along the Sandsea.')
('Tourist', 'Everything was going just fine until I suddenly,<br/>out of nowhere, blew a tire.')
('Tourist', 'Luckily, this green-haired bracer ran over to help us.<br/>He was kind enough to patch up the tire with the<br/>tools he had.')
('Tourist', 'It turned out he was heading to Tharbad, too, so we<br/>let him hitch a ride with us to thank him for<br/>his generosity.')
('Tourist', 'After that, we all made it to Tharbad. But just as I<br/>was going through my things so I could find my<br/>wallet and buy some souvenirs...')
('Tourist', "That's when I realized it went missing, and now I'm<br/>scrambling to find it. Isn't there something you<br/>can do?!")
('Receptionist Jibril', 'All right, I understand. You want to talk to this<br/>bracer to see if he has seen or possesses your wallet?')
('Tourist', "Yeah, that's exactly right. I'm beginning to wonder if<br/>maybe I got pickpocketed somehow while he was<br/>fixing our tire.")
('Tourist', 'I just want to ask if he noticed anything strange.<br/>Now, is there any way you can call him over?')
('Receptionist Jibril', "I'm sorry. It's probably going to take a little time for<br/>us to arrange a meeting with him.")
('Receptionist Jibril', "Based on your description, I know for a fact that he<br/>doesn't belong to our branch. That's what makes<br/>it tricky.")
('Receptionist Jibril', "I'd say it's more likely that whoever it was who came<br/>over and helped you was operating independently.")
('Receptionist Jibril', "No bracer matching that description has registered<br/>with us. If he's in town, we probably won't hear from<br/>him until at least tomorrow.")
('Tourist', "Really...? I guess I'll just have to wait and hope for<br/>the best.")
('Tourist', 'Still, if you hear anything about my wallet tonight,<br/>could you get in touch with me?')
('Tourist', "I'll wait around outside, by the oasis, in case anything<br/>comes up.")
('Receptionist Jibril', '*sigh* It never ends...')
('Feri', "I feel bad for her. It seems the guild's getting so many<br/>visitors, she can't catch a break.")
('Agnès', "Yeah. I hope that other man manages to find his<br/>wallet, too. That's awful, having it stolen.")
('Van', "Let's have a chat with her now that we're here and<br/>the line's opened up. We could learn<br/>somethin' interesting.")
('Van', "We meet again. Looks like you're keepin' busy, takin'<br/>people's requests this late.")
('Receptionist Jibril', "Ah, you all again. You heard that, I'm guessing?")
('Agnès', "Yeah, we did. I'm sorry, we really didn't mean to pry.")
('Agnès', 'That man said he lost his wallet, right?')
('Agnès', 'If only there was some way to talk to that<br/>green-haired bracer he mentioned and get his side of<br/>the story.')
('Risette', 'Indeed, although it sounds like determining which<br/>bracer it was could prove to be difficult.')
('Receptionist Jibril', "You're telling me. I'm pretty confident it's someone<br/>from out of town who decided to come by and help.")
('Receptionist Jibril', "But when he'll get in touch...who knows? He could<br/>drop by after he's checked out the city tonight.<br/>It could take him longer, even.")
('Receptionist Jibril', "Until we can figure out more, there's no way for me<br/>to pinpoint which bracer it was that man met.")
('Feri', "So it's mostly hurry up and wait for tomorrow. Boo!")
('Aaron', 'You guys are weirdly interested in all this.')
('Aaron', "Who cares if this mystery bracer shows up with one<br/>wallet or a hundred? Lotta mira, sure, but it's got<br/>nothing to do with us.")
('Van', "Maybe. Maybe... But somethin' about this whole<br/>situation stinks.")
('Receptionist Jibril', 'Hmm? What do you mean?')
('Van', "Ah, nothing. Just talkin' to myself. Good luck getting<br/>the guy sorted out.")
('Agnès', "From the sound of that, Van, you don't want to let<br/>this go.")
('Van', 'Well...that guy mentioned he was gonna hang out<br/>over by the oasis.')
('Van', "Couldn't hurt to have a chat with him. See if we can<br/>coax anything else out.")
('Risette', 'As you wish, Mr. Arkride.')
('Van', "Hey, I wanted to introduce myself. We're from<br/>Arkride Solutions.")
('Van', 'We were just at the guild, too, and happened to<br/>overhear your conversation at the front desk.')
('Tourist', 'Oh, yeah, I kind of remember passing by you people<br/>on the way out.')
('Tourist', 'Would any of you happen to know where I might<br/>find that green-haired bracer?')
('Van', "Not quite. We're actually lookin' for him, too.<br/>Got some business of our own.")
('Van', "I was hopin' you could tell us a little bit more about<br/>what happened.")
('Van', 'Would you mind? Anything else you can think of will<br/>help, big or small.')
('Van', 'Like, did he have any other distinct features or did<br/>anything else stick out to you in general?')
('Tourist', "You, too, huh? I'm sorry. In terms of features, I don't<br/>remember anything else other than he had green hair.")
('Tourist', 'I wish I could be of more help on that end. Blast<br/>my memory!')
('Tourist', 'As for anything else that stuck out—no, nothing<br/>really comes to mind.')
('Tourist', "Wait, that's not true. Actually, I do remember<br/>something that happened after we arrived.")
('Tourist', 'We bumped into a police officer who was patrolling<br/>the parking lot.')
('Tourist', 'I decided to go up to him and say hello. Strike up a<br/>little bit of a conversation.')
('Tourist', "But for some reason, the bracer<br/>looked uncomfortable. He wouldn't look the officer<br/>in the eye.")
('Risette', "A bracer was avoiding a police officer's gaze entirely?<br/>That's certainly a little unusual.")
('Tourist', "That's what I thought. I have heard that cops and<br/>bracers don't always get along all that well.")
('Tourist', "I figured maybe that's all it was. It did seem<br/>odd, though.")
('Feri', "Wait, I've never heard that before. Is that true?")
('Agnès', "It's common for police and bracers to run into one<br/>another at times because they both work to maintain<br/>the peace.")
('Agnès', "The difference is, the police work wholly within the<br/>law. Meanwhile, a bracer's first duty is<br/>protecting people.")
('Agnès', 'So they theoretically can act extralegally to do so, and<br/>sometimes they face jurisdictional friction and, well,<br/>differences of opinion.')
('Feri', "Oh, I get it. I guess I can see how that'd happen.")
('Aaron', "In this case, though, I think this 'bracer' of yours<br/>might've had other real good reasons for being a<br/>little skittish.")
('Tourist', "Huh? I don't understand. What do you mean?")
('Van', "Don't worry about it. We're saying that we're going<br/>to look into it on our end, too, and see if we can turn<br/>anything up.")
('Van', "I get you're keen to have your wallet back, but I think<br/>you should call it a night and come back tomorrow.")
('Tourist', '*sigh* I suppose you have a point.')
('Risette', 'On that note, if I may... Were you able to find a place<br/>to stay, despite losing your wallet?')
('Tourist', 'Yeah, thanks for asking. The guild was kind enough<br/>to cover me until I can pay them back.')
('Tourist', 'As long as I find my wallet soon, everything should<br/>work out one way or the other.')
('Tourist', "I'm still anxious, but knowing that I've got you all and<br/>the guild looking into it, I guess I feel okay going<br/>back to my room for the night.")
('Risette', "I am glad to hear that's all been taken care of.<br/>Please take care on your way.")
('Aaron', "That's one way to get rid of a guy. Now we can<br/>talk openly.")
('Aaron', "Right, so it sounds like this 'green-haired bracer'<br/>could be an impostor. What are we gonna do<br/>about it?")
('Feri', 'Wait, what? He is?!')
('Feri', 'Are you saying this is like what happened with that<br/>fake police officer we had to deal with before?')
('Van', "It's a distinct possibility, but we can't say for sure yet.")
('Agnès', "If this is true, that's really underhanded of him.")
('Van', "You're tellin' me. Your average person isn't ever<br/>gonna suspect a bracer of committin' a crime.")
('Risette', 'Therefore, if someone were to believably<br/>impersonate a bracer, they would be able to get<br/>away with a great many things.')
('Risette', "That could be quite damaging to the organization's<br/>reputation if nothing was done about it.")
('Agnès', "Luckily, as far as we can tell, the only victim who's<br/>emerged so far is that man. Or at least, he's the only<br/>one to file a report.")
('Agnès', "If we're quick enough in catching this impostor, we<br/>can minimize the amount of damage he'll do.")
('Van', "Eh, normally, I ain't exactly in the business of coverin'<br/>the guild's ass or anything. They can handle<br/>themselves just fine.")
('Van', "But I don't see the harm in stickin' our necks out just<br/>this once. It'll help us understand what's happening<br/>on the ground in this town, too.")
('Van', "So, come hell or high water, we'll uncover who this<br/>green-haired chump really is.")
('Aaron', "Hey, if it kills time, I'm game. Lead the way, chief.")
('Risette', 'I see no reason not to proceed. You have my full<br/>support as always, Mr. Arkride.')
('Feri', "Well, if we're gonna do this, what do we do first?")
('Feri', 'Should we see if anyone else has seen this bracer?<br/>Maybe if we talk to more people, we can start<br/>tracking him down.')
('Van', "That's exactly what I think we should do. We need to<br/>figure out this guy's trajectory.")
('Van', "If he is a fraud, though, it's probably safe to assume<br/>that he's keepin' his distance from the<br/>Cultural District. For obvious reasons.")
('Agnès', "Perhaps we should talk to people in the<br/>Entertainment District and see if he's been spotted<br/>around there, then.")
('Aaron', "Good point. The casino dealers could be a good place<br/>to start. They're bound to pay close attention to who's<br/>coming in.")
('Feri', "Anybody who spends a lot of time outside of it<br/>might've seen him, too!")
('Van', "All good ideas. Hopefully, once we start talking to<br/>some people, we'll come up with some leads.")
('Van', "Well, no time like the present. Let's roll.")
('System', 'Quest A Bogus Bracer started!')
('Receptionist Jibril', "*sigh* I can't believe the bracer we were all looking for<br/>turned out to be a fake.")
('Receptionist Jibril', "I'm glad you all found him as quickly as you did.<br/>He could have caused real problems for us if he'd<br/>stayed on the loose for too long.")
('Receptionist Jibril', 'On behalf of the guild, you have our sincere thanks<br/>for stopping him. We really appreciate it.')
('Van', "Nah, don't mention it. Our curiosity got the better of<br/>us, that's all.")
('Van', 'Though some MIGHT say that you guys owe us<br/>one, regardless.')
('Receptionist Jibril', "Oh, no question. We're more than willing to<br/>compensate you for everything you've done, including<br/>paying you for your time.")
('Agnès', "I'm just surprised that 'bracer' turned out to be who<br/>he was.")
('Feri', "Yeah. Another one of those thieving brothers who<br/>are wanted back in Edith. That's crazy.")
('Aaron', "Just like that fake cop we managed to bust yesterday.<br/>At the rate we're going, we'll probably meet their<br/>whole damn family tree soon.")
('Agnès', "We can't say for certain, but it sure seems like there's<br/>a good chance these brothers could strike<br/>again somewhere.")
('Agnès', 'We should keep our guard up in case anything<br/>else happens.')
('Aaron', "We've already managed to nab both of 'em.")
('Agnès', "Hopefully it means there'll be a little less crime<br/>around here, at the very least.")
('Aaron', "I wouldn't be so sure. They probably think they can<br/>use the commotion from the film festival to make a<br/>killing while the killing's good.")
('Aaron', "If there are MORE of these siblings out there, it's<br/>probably safe to assume they're already up to no good,<br/>whatever it is.")
('Receptionist Jibril', 'Agreed. The film festival probably needs heightened<br/>security in light of all this.')
('Receptionist Jibril', "Anyway, thanks again for taking care of all<br/>that, everyone. If anything else comes up tomorrow,<br/>we'd appreciate your help then, too.")
('System', 'Quest A Bogus Bracer completed!')
('System', 'Received')
('Archaeologist Inigo', 'Hmm? Would you all happen to be...?')
('Van', "That's right. We're with Arkride Solutions. We came<br/>to answer your request.")
('Van', 'Are you the archaeologist who made that post?')
('Archaeologist Inigo', "Yes, I am! I'm so glad you came. I was concerned<br/>whether my 4SPG would reach you.")
('Archaeologist Inigo', 'Anyway, allow me to introduce myself. My name<br/>is Inigo.')
('Archaeologist Inigo', "To cut to the chase, I'm about to conduct a survey of<br/>the underground waterway and would like you all to<br/>escort and protect me.")
('Aaron', "Really? That dingy place? Can't imagine a guy like<br/>you'd have any business there.")
('Archaeologist Inigo', "Ah! So you've already been down there, have you?<br/>That's reassuring.")
('Archaeologist Inigo', 'Believe it or not, that waterway has existed since the<br/>Dark Ages, and its construction continued<br/>throughout the Middle Ages.')
('Archaeologist Inigo', "It bears considerable historical value as a result.<br/>With that in mind, there's something inside I wish to<br/>investigate in person.")
('Feri', "Well...I don't see why we can't handle a job like that.")
('Feri', "But it doesn't sound like you really need spriggan help<br/>for this.")
('Agnès', 'You wrote that the guild told you to come back<br/>another day, right?')
('Archaeologist Inigo', "Yes. Evidently, they're rather occupied with getting<br/>things ready for the film festival at the moment.")
('Archaeologist Inigo', "Seeing as my request isn't exactly an emergency, it's<br/>only natural that they wouldn't prioritize it for now.")
('Archaeologist Inigo', 'Unfortunately, the fact of the matter is that I had to<br/>carve out time in order to be here.')
('Archaeologist Inigo', "I have to leave Tharbad tomorrow. So unless I<br/>conduct this survey today, it simply isn't going<br/>to happen.")
('Feri', "It's still not something that really has to be kept<br/>hushed up like our other clients, but I get why you'd<br/>ask us.")
('Risette', 'As do I. How should we proceed, Mr. Arkride?')
('Van', 'Good question.')
('Van', "It does feel like there's somethin' more to this.<br/>It could be worth our while to accept his request and<br/>see where it takes us.")
('Archaeologist Inigo', 'I need to conduct a survey in the underground<br/>waterway and would like you all to escort and<br/>protect me.')
('Archaeologist Inigo', 'Would you all be able to help me?')
('Van', "I'll definitely consider your request. Could you give us<br/>a little time to come to a decision?")
('Archaeologist Inigo', 'I suppose. I hope you decide soon.')
('Van', "Sure, I don't see the harm in comin' along. It's a good<br/>opportunity for us to patrol down there, anyway.")
('Van', "Count us in. We'll join you for your survey.")
('Archaeologist Inigo', "Wonderful! Thank you very much. You're doing me a<br/>great favor.")
('Van', "Well, what are we waitin' for? Let's make our<br/>way down.")
('Monir', "Oh, my. You're looking for a nocturnal sun, too?<br/>Those are surprisingly in demand today.")
('Risette', "Is that to say we're not the only ones to have asked<br/>you about it?")
('Monir', 'Right. There was another customer before you who<br/>bought them from me.')
('Monir', 'She cleaned out my entire stock—all ten of them—as<br/>a matter of fact.')
('Feri', 'All of them? Then does that mean...')
('Agnès', 'You have no more left for sale?')
('Monir', "Yes, that's right. I'm sorry to disappoint you.")
('Van', "Nah, it's not your fault. We just got an urgent need<br/>for some and are tryin' to find some as quickly as<br/>we can.")
('Van', "Luck just wasn't on our side this time. We'll try<br/>somewhere else. Thanks for your time.")
('Monir', "Actually, before you go, can I ask what you want<br/>them for? If you don't mind.")
('Van', "Sure, I don't see the harm in that. Basically...")
('System', 'Van explained what Bermotti was doing at the<br/>bartending tournament and why he needed<br/>the pomegranate.')
('Monir', 'Ah, I see. Thank you for clearing that up!')
('Monir', "You know, you might want to talk to Philica—see if<br/>she'll let you have some of her stock. She's the one<br/>who bought them from me.")
('Agnès', 'Philica, you said her name was? Where is she located?')
('Monir', 'She runs an ice cream stand in the<br/>Entertainment District.')
('Monir', "She's a regular customer of mine. If you tell her I sent<br/>you, I think she may be willing to help.")
('Monir', "I can't make any promises, though.")
('Risette', 'We understand. Thank you for the advice, we<br/>sincerely appreciate it. All we can do now is attempt<br/>to negotiate and see what happens.')
('Aaron', "Yeah, not like time's on our side here.")
('Aaron', "We should run over to that stand. That cocktail's not<br/>gonna fix itself.")
('Feri', "You're strangely eager to help, Aaron. What gives?")
('Van', "...In any case, I agree with Aaron. The Entertainment<br/>District's clearly our best lead.")
('Van', "Thanks for talking to us, ma'am.")
('Monir', 'Oh, no problem! Good luck finding<br/>those pomegranates!')
('System', 'HP, EP, and CP were fully restored, and S-Boost<br/>Gauge increased 3 points!')
('Agnès', "This is where Saara and Shaheena live, isn't it?")
('Van', "Yep, although they don't look to be home right now.")
('System', 'The door is locked.')
('Feri', 'I wonder if that way takes you below the city?')
('Van', "No way of knowing right now. We've got not reason<br/>to be here.")
('System', 'Enter the underground waterway?')
('Agnès', "I don't think it's open yet.")
('Van', "Guess not. We'll have to come back around and<br/>check it out later.")
