('Feri', "Whoa! We're going so fast!")
('Agnès', "The dial says 1,200 selge per hour—that's even faster<br/>than when we drove to Creil.")
('Van', 'Should be in before noon at this rate.')
('Van', "Ahh... Nothin' beats a ride on the expressway.<br/>Calvardian infrastructure, baby.")
('Feri', "Calvard really is amazing, isn't it?")
('Agnès', 'Granted, not all of our roads are this robust.<br/>Expressways are reserved for select routes between the<br/>three major cities.')
('Van', "Everywhere else is still plain ol' highways.")
('Van', "Can't complain too much, though. The government<br/>maintains our roads better than most.")
('Van', "So, this gonna be you two's first time in Langport?")
('Feri', 'It is for me.')
('Agnès', "I've been before, but just as an average tourist.")
('Agnès', 'It really is a wonderful place.')
('Agnès', "I've always wanted to visit again with my<br/>family someday...")
('Van', "Roughly speaking, the city's split into two parts:<br/>New Town and the Eastern Quarter.")
('Van', "For the sake of convenience, our hotel's in the<br/>Eastern Quarter.")
('Agnès', 'We stayed in New Town when I was there.')
('Van', 'Given our client this time, figured this would<br/>be easier.')
('Van', 'Not like I got the mira to afford a fancy New Town<br/>hotel, anyway.')
('Van', "Plan is to have the hotel be our home base while we<br/>knock out some jobs in town. 'Bout the same as usual.")
('Feri', "And while we're doing that, we gather information!")
('Van', "Spot on, kiddo. Now you're gettin' it.")
('Van', 'Oh, right. Another thing...')
('Van', 'Apparently the head of the Lu family, the house that<br/>Cao is affiliated with, wants to meet us in person.')
('Feri', 'Someone even more important than the purple guy<br/>from yesterday?')
('Van', "Yeah. He's a rising star in the ranks of Heiyue.")
('Van', "Usually, I'd steer clear of guys like him...")
('Van', '...but if we gotta meet up, may as well try to squeeze<br/>him for info.')
('Van', "Here's hopin' he's a bit of a senile old coot.")
('Agnès', 'Oh, Van... *sigh*')
('Van', "Back on topic. We're only in Langport for today<br/>and tomorrow.")
('Van', 'Once Cao gets back from Crossbell, we<br/>can skedaddle.')
('Van', "That's the plan, anyway. Wouldn't surprise me if we<br/>have to extend our stay a bit.")
('Van', "If that happens, you'll be headin' back by train like we<br/>agreed, yeah?")
('Agnès', "Right. I can't afford to miss my classes.")
('Agnès', "As long as I catch the last train tomorrow evening, I'll<br/>still be able to make it back in time.")
('Feri', 'You really did your research!')
('Agnès', 'I wanted to make sure I could help you both as much<br/>as possible.')
('Feri', "Then, let's bust this case wide open!")
('Van', 'The hell...?')
('Agnès', 'I wonder what happened.')
('Van', "I'mma go ask around.")
('Feri', 'Any useful intel?')
('Van', 'Apparently, a trailer came open and spilled stuff all<br/>over the road.')
('Van', 'Couple of lanes are closed up ahead.')
('Van', "Tch. We're two for two on gettin' into trouble on<br/>car rides. Hope this ain't a sign...")
('Agnès', 'Do you think it will take long for them to clear<br/>the road?')
('Van', 'Nah. Twenty minutes or so, I reckon.')
('Van', "Till then, I'mma get some shuteye.")
('Agnès', 'Did you not sleep well last night?')
('Van', "Someone was busy talkin' my ear off, so not really.")
('Van', "*yawn* Give my shoulder a shake when things<br/>start movin'...")
('Van', '...')
('Agnès', 'I-Is he asleep already?')
('Feri', "I've heard expert warriors can fall asleep at will.")
('Agnès', "Van's something else, isn't he?")
('Agnès', 'He acts cold and pragmatic, but never compromises<br/>on his ideals.')
('Agnès', "Even when he tries to keep you at arm's length, you<br/>can always tell he has your best interests at heart.")
('Feri', 'Not to mention that he has the combat experience<br/>and skills of a seasoned veteran.')
('Feri', 'But the way he navigates a battle is nothing like how<br/>my brother or father would.')
('Feri', 'Sometimes it feels like he knows everyone and can<br/>get along with them, too—for better or worse.')
('Agnès', "It kind of adds this air of mystery to him,<br/>doesn't it? I really hope I can get to know<br/>him better...")
('Feri', 'Heehee. You know, I was thinking the same thing<br/>about you.')
('Agnès', 'Huh?')
('Feri', "You're a normal person, but you jump into dangerous<br/>situations with us like it's nothing.")
('Feri', 'You support us in battle, and stand up for what you<br/>believe in, too.')
('Feri', 'Seeing all that makes me want to try even harder!')
('Agnès', "Y-You're giving me too much credit. I'm just acting<br/>on instinct.")
('Agnès', "Still, I'm glad that I'm able to help you both.")
('Agnès', 'If you have any trouble figuring things out in the city,<br/>please let me know!')
('Agnès', 'And, even though I spend so much time at the office,<br/>my grades are pretty good. I can help you study, too.')
('Feri', "Really? That'd be great! My math homework from<br/>Sunday School is super hard, and I—")
('Maxim', "Hey, there. You girlies know what's going on?")
('Agnès', 'You mean the traffic jam?')
('Agnès', 'Apparently, a trailer spilled and some lanes have<br/>been closed.')
('Agnès', 'The road should be clear in twenty minutes or so.')
('Maxim', 'That so, huh? Hmm... What a drag.')
('Maxim', "But maybe I've found my diamond in the rough.<br/>You on vacation or something?")
('Agnès', 'Umm...')
('Feri', "We're on a business trip!")
('Maxim', '...Okay. Uh, anyway.')
('Maxim', "I'm off work today myself and could use a<br/>little company.")
('Maxim', 'Wanna hang with the champ?')
('Feri', 'Huh?')
('Agnès', 'Excuse me?')
('Maxim', "You've got to be kidding me... You don't recognize<br/>THE face of the Red Comet?!")
('Feri', "I don't know a warrior by that name.")
('Feri', 'Which corps are you from? The Red Constellation?')
('Agnès', "Haha... I don't think it's that kind of nickname.")
('Agnès', "I've only heard it in passing, but I'm pretty sure it<br/>belongs to a Z1 driver.")
('Feri', "What's a 'Z1'?")
('Maxim', "Th-This can't be happening...")
('Maxim', 'Listen up! My name is Maxim Lugan!')
('Maxim', "I'm the man who did the impossible and won the Z1<br/>Grand Prix—the apex of racing competitions—three<br/>years in a row!")
('Maxim', "I've got it all: looks, wealth, incomparable talent!")
('Maxim', "Tyrell Entertainment magazine named me 'Calvard's<br/>Most Eligible Bachelor' over a bunch of<br/>famous actors!")
('Maxim', "I'm the most desired man in the entire country!")
('Agnès', 'I-I see...')
('Feri', 'That sounds really neat, mister.')
('Maxim', '...?!')
('Maxim', "That's it! Let me show you how great I am!")
('Maxim', "Get out of this scrap heap on wheels, and I'll show<br/>you a REAL—!")
('Van', "*yawn* The hell you think you're doin'?")
('Maxim', 'Wha...?')
('Agnès', 'Van?!')
('Feri', 'When did he wake up?')
('Van', "Never thought I'd see a hot shot like you tryin' to hit<br/>on kids.")
('Van', 'Meld and Buzzraider are gonna have a field day with<br/>this one.')
(40302, 'Is a fight starting or something?')
(40301, "Wait, isn't that...?")
(40303, "It's Maxim Lugan!")
('Maxim', 'Ugh...')
('Van', "Hold on. I ain't lettin' that slide so easy.")
('Van', "You think you can just walk up, mouth off to a guy's<br/>true love, and get away with it?")
('Maxim', 'Urgh...')
('Agnès', 'V-Van?')
('Van', "My baby's the only one for me. She came to me in a<br/>low moment, but I've fixed my Ingert up good!")
('Agnès', 'I should have known...')
('Feri', 'Huh?')
('Van', "Sure, she ain't fresh off the line or nothin', but I'd bet<br/>I've spent more on my baby than you on your ETWS.")
('Maxim', 'I-I believe you, all right?! Let go of me, already!')
('Feri', "Wow. He's really serious about this.")
('Maxim', "You'll rue the day you crossed Maxim Lugan!")
('Agnès', "Couldn't you have gone a little easier on him?")
('Van', "Listen, there are some things in life a man can't<br/>compromise on.")
('Van', "Anyway, don't go lowering the window for strangers.<br/>Coulda been a thief for all you knew.")
('Agnès', "I'm sorry. I'll be more careful next time.")
('Feri', "Thankfully, he wasn't the dangerous type.")
('Van', "Not in the fightin' way, at least.")
('Van', "Dingo was right on the mira 'bout him being a<br/>big-headed jackass.")
('Agnès', "You're familiar with him, then?")
('Van', "Course. If you're into cars, his name is everywhere.")
('Van', 'Shame that the best driver out there just so happens<br/>to be the worst kinda guy.')
('Feri', "I didn't even know him, but I still feel kind of<br/>let down.")
('Van', 'Now imagine how I feel.')
('Agnès', 'Oh, look! Traffic is finally moving again.')
('Van', "'Bout time.")
('Agnès', "The road feels so empty now that we aren't<br/>surrounded by cars.")
('Van', 'Good thing, too. Gotta make up for all that lost time.')
('Feri', 'Van! A fast vehicle is approaching from our six!')
('Agnès', "Oh, it's him.")
('Feri', 'The guy with the big head.')
('Van', "Itchin' for a race, huh?")
('Van', 'Hold on tight, kiddos!')
('Agnès', 'What?!')
('Feri', "Let's go!")
('Maxim', 'Heh. Looks like the rolling scrap heap has some fight<br/>in it after all.')
('Maxim', "Good. I'll show you why I'm the best there is!")
('Feri', "It's such a shame Agnès got called away.")
('Feri', 'I was really hoping this would be our first 4SPG as a<br/>team of four.')
('Van', "If school or—in this case—family comes knockin',<br/>there ain't much she can do about it.")
('Van', 'Call outs come with the territory of part-time jobs.')
('Aaron', 'Hmm.')
('Aaron', "You know, there's something fishy with that girl—<br/>and I don't just mean the Genesis stuff.")
('Feri', '...What are you talking about?')
('Van', '...')
('Aaron', 'I think her whole backstory might be made up.')
('Aaron', "Epstein's like, mega-famous. Dude invented<br/>the orbment. Is she really related to a big shot<br/>like him?")
('Aaron', "Also her last name, 'Claudel,' is totally made up.")
('Feri', 'What?! You really think so?')
('Van', 'Man, you really are sharp.')
('Van', "I don't think she pulled the name outta a hat, though.")
('Van', 'Every time she introduces herself, she seems proud<br/>but also a little guilty.')
('Van', "So I'm thinkin' it's her mother's maiden name<br/>or something.")
('Feri', 'Huh.')
('Aaron', 'You saw right through her, too, huh?')
('Aaron', "Anyway, there's no reason to use a fake name unless<br/>the real one's worth hiding.")
('Aaron', "If I had to bet, I'd say it's actually—")
('Feri', "W-Wait just a minute. I'm having trouble keeping<br/>up here...")
('Feri', 'But if Agnès is keeping this secret from us, she must<br/>have a reason.')
('Feri', "I don't think we should be prying.")
('Aaron', "C'mon, small fry. I know deep down you want to find<br/>out, too.")
('Aaron', "You want to understand why she'd hide stuff from the<br/>people she claims are her friends.")
('Feri', 'W-Well, I...')
('Feri', '...')
('Van', "*sigh* Maybe people callin' you the 'prodigy of<br/>Langport' was just a fluke.")
('Van', "Someone with that rep would know better than to<br/>gossip about a teenager when they ain't even around.")
('Aaron', '...!')
('Van', "Everyone's got a secret or two they don't wanna<br/>share—even with folks they call their friends.")
('Van', "Leavin' home must've turned you into a real<br/>small-minded man if you can't understand that.")
('Aaron', 'Ugh...')
('Aaron', 'All right, all right. I was being a bit childish.')
('Aaron', "In the end, she's just another teenage girl, so I guess it<br/>doesn't really matter who she is or where she's from.")
('Aaron', "But if she's supposed to be watching my back in<br/>battle, I at least want to know how serious she is<br/>about all this.")
('Feri', "...I suspect the answer to that is 'more than any of us.'")
('Van', "Yeah. I'm with you there.")
('Van', "She doesn't know diddly about combat compared to<br/>the rest of us, yet she still chooses to fight<br/>alongside us.")
('Van', "In this short time, she's already faced a lifetime's<br/>worth of danger 'cause of it, too.")
('Aaron', 'Hmph...')
('Aaron', "Say, this ride of yours isn't half bad after all.")
('Aaron', "But can't this tin can go any faster? I'm not getting<br/>any younger here.")
('Van', "Cut the crap or I'm leavin' you on the side of<br/>the road.")
('Feri', '...')
('Aaron', "What's the matter, small fry?")
('Aaron', 'This about that bracer girl we just met?')
('Feri', "Umm... It's nothing really.")
('Feri', 'I think someone I was close to has mentioned<br/>her before.')
('Feri', "I was hoping we'd have the chance to meet someday...")
('Feri', '...but once she was in front of me, I just...froze up.')
('Van', "You'll get more chances. Use the time till then to get<br/>your feelings in order.")
('Feri', 'Van...')
('Feri', "You're right. Next time, I'll say everything I've been<br/>wanting to say!")
('Aaron', 'Nice pep talk, pops.')
('Aaron', "Not that I have any clue what you guys are talkin'<br/>about, though.")
('Van', "Aww, little Aaron feelin' left out?")
('Aaron', 'Hell no!')
('Agnès', "Say, Van, you really do trust Dingo, don't you?")
('Agnès', 'Even if this job is bigger than what we normally do,<br/>you heard Nina out because of his recommendation.')
('Van', "We go way back is all. I've known him since I was<br/>first starting out as a fixer.")
('Van', "It's a give and take kinda relationship. He gives me<br/>jobs, and I feed him info I pick up.")
('Aaron', 'Speaking of info, he knows Jack, too, right?')
('Aaron', "You guys are in cahoots with a lot of colorful<br/>characters, huh? There's Bermotti, too.")
('Van', "Dingo's definitely the most upstandin' one of 'em,<br/>that's for sure.")
('Van', "Doesn't get too friendly with you, but if you give him<br/>a job, he'll always get it done.")
('Van', 'Pretty easy guy to trust, if you ask me.')
('Feri', 'He seems really well connected, too. He even<br/>knows Nina.')
('Feri', "Wasn't it him who arranged for our 4SPGs in<br/>Tharbad, too?")
('Van', "He's half Central Eastern, so maybe that's why he's<br/>got so many acquaintances out there.")
('Van', "And he's got that rep as the journalist who turned<br/>down a Fulitzer.")
('Agnès', 'Really?!')
('Agnès', 'But the Fulitzer Prize is the highest honor a reporter<br/>can receive!')
('Aaron', 'How the hell did a small time dude at a gossip mag<br/>get in the running for that?')
('Van', "...Who knows. I'm sure there's a reason.")
('Van', "He's gonna be in Tharbad startin' on the second day<br/>we're there to cover the festival.")
('Van', 'So we oughta be able to count on him to round up<br/>some leads for us.')
('Aaron', 'Damn, this back seat is the life. Eight might be a<br/>tight fit, but I could spend a night here, for sure.')
('Van', 'I swear to Aidios if you get dirt on that seat! Take off<br/>your damn shoes or something!')
('Feri', "It's a shame Agnès couldn't come with us. It's not the<br/>same without her.")
('Risette', "Don't worry. I'm sure she'll have a chance to try out<br/>the upgraded back seat soon enough.")
('Risette', 'Even though there is less space for cargo, the<br/>computer still fits snugly.')
('Van', 'Yeah. It kinda scares me how that crown prince knew<br/>how to pick such a perfect gift.')
('Van', "Word to the wise, don't ever get in debt to people<br/>like that.")
('Aaron', 'He says while having the time of his life installing<br/>that very same gift.')
('Feri', "It is weird, though. It feels like he's using both us and<br/>the guild depending on what he wants to do.")
('Feri', "Unrelated, but what's Basel like? I've never been, not<br/>even for an operation.")
('Van', "Couldn't say I'm the biggest expert myself, but I have<br/>been there a few times for jobs.")
('Van', "Located down in southwest Calvard on the walls of<br/>Auge Canyon, it's a haven of learnin' and industry.")
('Van', 'The Institute of Science and the Artisanal District<br/>have been around since the Middle Ages.')
('Risette', 'Indeed. Alongside those two areas is New Town<br/>which houses Verne at its center.')
('Risette', "It sprung up when one of Professor Epstein's three<br/>disciples brought in advanced technology.")
('Feri', "Oh! I know, that was Professor Hamilton from the<br/>Central East, wasn't it?")
(500, 'November 16th, 4:35PM')
('Yumé', "Look, there's the tower!")
('Feri', "That's right! That means we're almost home.")
('Agnès', 'Are you starting to think of Edith as home, Feri?')
('Feri', 'Heehee. I guess I am. It was nice to get away for a<br/>while on our trip, though.')
('Quatre', 'The orbal network connection was a little slow, but<br/>the cozy atmosphere and delicious food more than<br/>made up for that.')
('Quatre', 'Oh, and the springs were relaxing, too.')
('Aaron', 'So you DID end up sneaking in all on your<br/>lonesome, huh?')
('Aaron', "Laaame. There's nothing better than hanging c***s<br/>out with the boys in a hot bath.")
('Quatre', 'Wh-Wh-What are you TALKING about?!')
('Agnès', 'Aaron...')
('Feri', 'As in...roosters?')
('Yumé', "Oh! Grandpa taught me about farm animals! But I<br/>didn't see any chickens in the bath...")
('Agnès', "Uhh... Aaron's just talking nonsense again.")
('Aaron', "Miss Perfect knows what I'm talking about. Bet you<br/>learned all about it in those raunchy gossip mags<br/>you like.")
('Agnès', 'Th-Those belong to my friends!')
('Agnès', "Ahem. Isn't it about time for you to kindly.<br/>Stop. Talking?")
('Aaron', "...Yes, ma'am.")
('Quatre', '(She can be surprisingly forceful when she wants<br/>to be...)')
('Van', 'Sheesh. We go on a trip and everything, and the<br/>youngsters have still got energy to spare.')
('Judith', "Aaah, we really aren't as bright-eyed and bushy-tailed<br/>as we used to be, are we?")
('Risette', 'Really? I think you two are plenty young yourselves.')
('Judith', 'I guess, but lately it feels like I always tire out before<br/>Nina does.')
('Judith', "*sigh* Speaking of, I need to figure out where I'm<br/>going to stay tonight.")
('Van', 'What about your fancy condo near Trion Tower?')
('Judith', "Buzzraider's paparazzi have been staking it out for a<br/>while now.")
('Judith', "They've even got eyes on Nina's place.")
('Judith', "It shouldn't be long until they get bored and move on<br/>to the next story, but until then, it's a pain in the neck<br/>for me.")
('Van', "Ugh. They'll do whatever it takes to eke out a win<br/>over Meld.")
('Risette', 'Would you like me to find you a secure hotel to stay<br/>in during the interim?')
('Judith', "You'd do that for me? Please and thank you!")
('Judith', 'Any chance I could convince you to become<br/>my manager?')
('Risette', 'You flatter me. Unfortunately, I am already on loan<br/>to Arkride Solutions from my employer as it is.')
('Van', "Hey, quit tryin' to poach my people.")
('Van', 'Hmm?')
('Van', '...')
('Judith', "What's wrong?")
('Risette', 'There is heavier than usual traffic up ahead.')
('Feri', 'I wonder why...')
('Agnès', "I wonder if something's happening inside<br/>the capital...")
('Agnès', "I'm really sorry for keeping this from you all.")
('Quatre', 'Your relation to Professor Epstein was plenty<br/>surprising as is.')
('Quatre', 'I never imagined your father was a huge<br/>celebrity, too.')
('Aaron', "It was real obvious you were hiding something,<br/>but damn. That's a hell of a bombshell.")
('Judith', "No kidding. I'm still processing everything.")
('Feri', 'Heehee. I get what you mean!')
('Risette', 'I assume the decision to conceal your surname was<br/>made by the government?')
('Agnès', "...That's correct. It was part of a program designed to<br/>protect confidential state secrets.")
('Agnès', "Claudel was my mother's last name. My real name<br/>is—")
('Van', "You don't gotta spell it out.")
('Van', "Had a hunch you borrowed it from your mom's<br/>side, though.")
('Agnès', 'Oh, really?')
('Agnès', "...It's been four years since my mother died now.")
('Agnès', "Before that, even though my father was a politician in<br/>the opposition party, he was always just 'Dad' to me.")
('Agnès', "But after Mom died—and especially after he<br/>announced his candidacy two years ago—we've been<br/>drifting further and further apart.")
('Agnès', "That was followed by the surprise election result that<br/>I'm sure you all know about.")
('Agnès', "After that, I enrolled at Aramis under my<br/>mother's surname.")
('Agnès', "I wasn't expecting my childhood friends, Odette and<br/>Albert, to be there, too, though.")
('Agnès', "Dad's remained distant ever since.")
('Agnès', "I suppose that's what led me to becoming so invested<br/>in the diaries Mom left behind.")
('Agnès', 'Which eventually brought me to Van to find the<br/>first Genesis.')
('Agnès', 'I think you all know the rest of the story from there.')
('Feri', 'Agnès...')
('Quatre', "So that's how it is.")
('Judith', "Both my mother and grandmother are still around, so<br/>I can't relate to that part of your story...")
('Judith', "...but I can certainly understand being attached to<br/>your family's legacy.")
('Agnès', 'Oh...')
('Agnès', 'Yes, we seem to be much the same in that respect.')
('Van', "Just so you know, I don't discriminate, so who your<br/>parents are ain't a problem for me.")
('Van', "But so long as I'm payin' you, I'm gonna be workin'<br/>you hard.")
('Van', "I don't need your pops tellin' me to do that.")
('Agnès', 'Of course.')
('Feri', "Heehee. I've got your back, Agnès!")
('Aaron', "Man, how'd we end up being such a group<br/>of weirdos? Myself included, I guess.")
('Aaron', "The old man here's got something that draws in<br/>people like us.")
('Agnès', 'Uhm...')
('Quatre', "He's not wrong...")
('Van', "You know I can see you all makin' faces in the<br/>rear-view mirror like I'm some kinda trouble<br/>magnet, right?!")
('Van', "Especially you, Judith! You don't even work for me!")
('Risette', "Actually, I've made arrangements to pay her<br/>commensurate with the services she provides.")
('Van', 'Say what?!')
('Judith', "I insisted on working for free, but she wouldn't take<br/>no for an answer.")
('Van', "Oh, c'mon, Risette. She's already rollin' in cash from<br/>all her actin' work.")
('Van', 'That mira was gonna go toward a new body kit for<br/>the car...')
('Feri', 'Van...')
('Aaron', 'I swear, this dude only cares about the three Cs: cars,<br/>confections, and communal baths...')
('Quatre', '*sigh* If I ever end up like him, please smack me<br/>upside the head.')
('Quatre', 'I think you may need to start keeping him on a<br/>shorter leash, Agnès.')
('Agnès', "I'll consider it...")
('Van', "We're doin' this test in the outskirts of the city?")
('Van', "Guessin' it involves the wireless boosters and<br/>extenders that're bein' set up along the highway, then.")
('Dingo', "Heh. You really don't let any technology news pass<br/>you by, do you?")
('Van', 'I just happened to catch a rumor about it.')
('Dingo', "The test is for a new cutting-edge feature for<br/>orbal cameras. It's called cloud storage.")
('Dingo', 'It lets one upload data directly to the orbal network<br/>using those wireless boosters and extenders.')
('Dingo', "If it works properly, I'll be able to capture and save<br/>more photos and videos while I'm out in the field.")
('Dingo', 'Having a copy there also makes it less likely for the<br/>data to be lost or damaged, supposedly.')
('Van', 'Damn. Technology sure is advancing fast these days.')
('Dingo', "The tech's still in development, though. A small<br/>portion is being tested by the military.")
('Dingo', 'But I do expect the feature to hit the<br/>market eventually.')
('Van', "How'd you get your hands on it? You testin' them for<br/>Marduk or something?")
('Dingo', 'Nah. I got it through Kitty.')
('Van', 'Ah, yeah. That makes sense.')
('Van', 'You met her through that case with the rich kid last<br/>year, right?')
('Dingo', 'Yeah. We swap info every now and then.')
('Dingo', "It's funny to think about how many shared<br/>acquaintances we have now.")
('Van', 'Fate works in weird-ass ways.')
('Dingo', 'You can say that again.')
('Dingo', 'Stop the car here.')
('Van', 'This your first test spot?')
('Dingo', "That's right. I won't be long.")
('Dingo', "Works like a dream. The transfer speed isn't half<br/>bad, either.")
('Dingo', 'Do you mind driving me to the next spot?')
('Van', 'Sure thing.')
('Dingo', 'You met her shortly after our first encounter, right?')
('Van', 'Huh?')
('Dingo', 'Kitty.')
('Van', "Oh, yeah. Feels like it's been ages since then.")
('Van', 'Five years ago, I helped her shake off an insane<br/>jackass, and then I got her into Crossbell—where she<br/>took refuge for a while.')
('Dingo', 'Sounds like she was going through a difficult time.')
('Van', "That ain't the half of it. At that point, she had given<br/>up on a lot in her life, and she was also<br/>really aggressive.")
('Dingo', "Funny. That's exactly how I would describe you from<br/>back then.")
('Dingo', 'You used to be constantly at my throat, remember?')
('Van', 'Uhh... Yeah, I guess I was. Not to make excuses, but I<br/>was young and dumb.')
('Van', "I'd only just started out as a spriggan, so I had no idea<br/>what the hell I was doin'.")
('Dingo', "Yet even so, I couldn't help but be drawn to you.<br/>Your latent potential was clear as day.")
('Dingo', "I wish your assistants could've seen what you were like<br/>at the time.")
('Van', 'That makes one of us. The sooner everyone can<br/>forget that period of my life, the better.')
('Van', "But I'll never forget how you were always lookin' out<br/>for me, despite how much of a walking hazard I was<br/>to myself and everyone around me.")
('Van', 'I still remember the first piece of advice you gave me.')
('Dingo', 'Think about what you can do, and what you want<br/>to do.')
('Dingo', "You'll find a clue on how to move forward in the gap<br/>between the two.")
('Dingo', 'I only vaguely recall saying that, to be honest.')
('Van', 'Those words helped me out a bunch of times.')
('Dingo', 'Is that so?')
('Dingo', 'Oh, pull over here. This is the second spot.')
('Dingo', "We're a good bit away from the city, but the<br/>signal's still decent.")
('Dingo', 'The transfer speed is a tad slower, but I can deal<br/>with it.')
('Dingo', 'Could you take me to the next spot?')
('Van', 'Will do.')
('Dingo', "I hear you've hired yet another assistant.")
('Dingo', 'The number of people in your employ is growing fast.')
('Van', 'A little too fast, if you ask me.')
('Van', "But at least I don't have to do paperwork anymore.<br/>Risette's sparin' me that headache.")
('Dingo', "Well, regardless, you've been surrounding yourself<br/>with some interesting people.")
('Dingo', "Especially the blonde-haired one. She's an Aramis<br/>student like Kitty, right?")
('Dingo', 'If my instincts are right, she—')
('Van', "Let's not play detective with her. Everyone's got their<br/>secrets, right?")
('Dingo', 'True enough.')
('Dingo', "I suppose you and I also have things we don't want to<br/>share with each other.")
('Van', "Yep. We've both got sides that we'd rather<br/>keep hidden.")
('Van', 'The only person who can face that part of yourself<br/>is you.')
('Dingo', "Couldn't have put it better myself.")
('Dingo', 'Here we are. This is the final spot.')
('Dingo', "I'm honestly impressed. I thought the connection<br/>would've been more spotty, given how far we were<br/>from the city.")
('Van', 'Guess we can call this test a success.')
('Dingo', 'Yeah. Thanks for the help, Van.')
('Dingo', 'Now I can...')
('Van', 'Hmm? Yeah, no prob. Always happy to lend a hand.')
('Van', "That cloud storage thing still sounds crazy to me.<br/>Technology's come a long way in the last decade.")
('Dingo', "This is true. And you've seen that firsthand in Basel<br/>and while working with Marduk.")
('Dingo', "It's all a result of generations of people building on<br/>the achievements of those who came before them.")
('Van', "Is that kind of thinking why you always look out<br/>for Marielle? You tryin' to help the next generation?")
('Dingo', 'Perhaps. It might be why I did the same for you five<br/>years ago.')
('Dingo', "I just can't bring myself to turn a blind eye to<br/>someone in need, even if I honestly don't know if I<br/>have the right to be helping anyone.")
('Dingo', 'Especially after all the pain I caused with my poor<br/>judgment in my younger years.')
('Van', 'Dingo...')
('Van', "I've just got one thing to say to that.")
('Van', "You've taught me a lot over these past five years.")
('Van', "And I'm sure Marielle's absorbin' a fair bit from<br/>you, too.")
('Van', 'The knowledge she gains from you will definitely<br/>help her as she follows her own path through life—<br/>just as it helped me with mine.')
('Dingo', '...')
('Van', "I'm not gonna let anyone dismiss everything you've<br/>done for us—and that includes you.")
('Van', "Besides, if you're sayin' you've got poor judgment,<br/>where does that leave us?")
('Dingo', "Fair point. I didn't mean to slight you or her.")
('Dingo', "Forget I said anything. That wasn't like me.")
('Dingo', '(Still...)')
('Dingo', "(No. He's a grown man now. It's not my place to tell<br/>him that.)")
('Dingo', "(I'm sure the influence of those around him will lead<br/>him to realize the truth on his own.)")
('Van', "You're bein' awfully quiet all of a sudden.")
('Dingo', "Oh, I was just thinking about how much you've<br/>grown these past five years.")
('Dingo', 'You were still pretty immature back then.')
('Van', 'Can we not talk about this?!')
('System', 'The two of them drove back to the capital. Van then<br/>bade farewell to Dingo and returned to his work.')
('Aaron', 'Hey, you were one of the guys who were riding<br/>recklessly in Edith a while back, yeah?')
('Aaron', 'Heh. This could be fun.')
('Damian', "This isn't a freakin' game, you know. It's an epic<br/>showdown between full-fledged racers!")
('Damian', "I heard that isn't even your bike. If you aren't a real<br/>orbal bike rider, then why the hell are you even here?")
('Aaron', 'I just get a kick out of picking fights. I live to<br/>humiliate idiots like you.')
('Aaron', 'All right. Time to punch it!')
('Damian', "Haha! If it's a fight you want, it's a fight you'll get!")
('Aaron', "Oh, you're on.")
('Van', "What the HELL is he doin'?! That's my master's<br/>bike, you asshole!")
('Jack', "We really should've seen that one coming.")
('Junifer', 'Boys will be boys.')
('Junifer', "We can fix her up after the race, so don't worry.")
('Damian', 'How have you not lost your balance?! You should be<br/>veering off the side of the road!')
('Aaron', "I can do this shit all day. Don't tell me you're ready to<br/>call it quits already?")
('Damian', "Hell no! I'm gonna win this! See you never, loser!")
('Aaron', "All right. What's the play?")
('Aaron', 'Time to turn the tables!')
('Aaron', "Damn it! This bike's too damn big!")
('Damian', 'That was a close one! He put up a damn good fight<br/>for a rookie.')
('Aaron', 'Time to turn the tables!')
('Damian', '...')
('Damian', 'Holy HELL! That guy is nuts!')
('Aaron', "Aww, yeah! This one's in the bag!")
('Van', 'That dumbass.')
('Junifer', 'Ahaha...')
('Aaron', 'Haaaaaaah!')
