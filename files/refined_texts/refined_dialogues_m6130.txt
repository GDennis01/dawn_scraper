('Olympia', 'Welcome, players. We shall now commence the third<br/>round of the game.')
('Olympia', 'My name is Olympia. I have been tasked by Almata<br/>with supervising the lower floors of the arena.')
('Quatre', "It's that girl with the giant doll.")
('Risette', 'As we expected.')
('Olympia', "Your fates, as well as this city's, will be decided by the<br/>end of today.")
('Olympia', 'If you wish to advance to the palace, you must first<br/>face me.')
('Olympia', 'To do so, you will need to gather twenty keycards.<br/>That is the only condition for this round.')
('Olympia', 'Your time limit is five hours.')
('Olympia', 'Should you fail to defeat me within that time, I have<br/>been instructed to detonate the bombs spread<br/>throughout the city.')
('Olympia', 'I care little as to how this ends, so I will leave the<br/>decision to you.')
('Aaron', "Guess the remaining teams have no choice but to go<br/>at each other's throats.")
('Fie', 'Well, it is the final day, so that makes sense.')
('Cao', 'I suppose it only makes sense. It is the final day,<br/>after all.')
('Shizuna', "Makes sense. It's the final day, after all.")
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Works for me. I love a good bloodbath.')
('Van', "There aren't many teams left, but that don't mean<br/>today'll be a walk in the park. Might be the opposite.")
('Van', "We'll find a way, though—as we always do. We just<br/>gotta get those cards, take her out, and deal with<br/>Dantès and Melchior in the palace.")
('Van', "Basically, our goal's the same as it was before.")
('Agnès', 'Right.')
('Feri', "I'm ready to go!")
('Van', "Well, this is it, y'all. However this ends, it ends today.<br/>So let's get on out there and take home the gold!")
(500, 'Meanwhile...')
('Dominion Celis', 'Haaaaaaaaah!')
(40451, 'Ooooooooh!')
(40451, 'Ooooooooh!')
('Dominion Celis', "Tch. We're getting nowhere fast.")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "I expected some resistance, but I didn't anticipate it<br/>being so fierce.")
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'Perhaps you should have.')
('Commander Geraint', 'Perhaps you should have.')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "I should note, I'm not saying I underestimated you.")
('Vice Chief Hasan', "Worry not. I didn't take it that way.")
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'Tell me, do you remember fighting our other squad in<br/>the first round?')
('Commander Geraint', 'I am not suggesting you did.')
('Commander Geraint', 'Tell me, do you remember your fight against our<br/>other unit? That was two days ago now.')
('Dominion Celis', 'Sure do. We kicked their asses.')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'Your squad here is many orders of magnitude<br/>stronger than the one we faced.')
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'Flattering, but I disagree with your assessment.')
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'Our other squad may have struggled against you, but<br/>they learned quite a bit from their defeat.')
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'You see, it is not altogether uncommon for us to face<br/>the same opponents many times on the battlefield.')
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'Even if we know we cannot win a battle, we will still<br/>learn, observe, and gather information on our foes.')
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'Then we share that information with the others in<br/>our tribe—and ensure our victory in our<br/>next encounter.')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'Your main squad is many orders of magnitude<br/>stronger than the one we faced.')
('Commander Geraint', 'Believe it or not, the difference in strength between<br/>our units is not so different as you might think.')
('Commander Geraint', 'Our other squad may have lost against you, but they<br/>did not do so in vain.')
('Commander Geraint', 'We are well accustomed to facing the same<br/>opponents in battle more than once.')
('Commander Geraint', 'And we are prepared to tackle a losing battle head on<br/>because we can always learn from our enemy.')
('Commander Geraint', 'Then we can share that knowledge with the rest of<br/>our corps...')
('Commander Geraint', '...and be victorious in our next bout.')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'Ah, I see now. That tactic gives you quite the<br/>advantage here, then.')
('Dominion Celis', "No wonder you've been able to exploit our openings<br/>so damn well.")
('Vice Chief Hasan', "Now, it wouldn't be as effective on a jaeger corps,<br/>since most have adopted a similar strategy...")
('Vice Chief Hasan', "...but it's clear the Gralsritter hasn't done so.")
('Commander Geraint', "Now, it wouldn't be as effective on another jaeger<br/>corps, since most have adopted a similar strategy...")
('Commander Geraint', "...but it's clear the Gralsritter hasn't done so.")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'Naturally. Our organization serves a very different<br/>purpose from yours.')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'We have less experience fighting other humans—this<br/>fight has made that crystal clear.')
('Dominion Celis', "But don't think for a second that you'll actually<br/>beat us. Your stupid little tricks will only get you<br/>so far.")
('Vice Chief Hasan', "We're only just getting started. Now that we've worn<br/>you down, we will fully go on the offensive.")
('Commander Geraint', "We're only just getting started. Now that we've worn<br/>you down, we will fully go on the offensive.")
('Dominion Celis', "Now that's what I'm talking about. Bring it on, you<br/>old coot!")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "It's time to settle this.")
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'We shall end this now! Shine, Falcons of the Sun!')
(40451, 'Sir!')
('Commander Geraint', 'Victory will be ours! All units, assume the Dual<br/>Lancer formation!')
(40451, 'Ja!')
('Dominion Celis', "Let's do this, Leon!")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'Right!')
('Arioch', 'Raaaaaaaaah!')
('Dominion Celis', 'Huh...?!')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', '...?!')
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'What...happened?!')
('Commander Geraint', 'What...happened?!')
('Dominion Celis', 'You bastard!')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'What are you doing here?')
('Vice Chief Hasan', "I don't recall breaking any rules.")
('Commander Geraint', "I don't recall breaking any rules.")
('Arioch', "Nah, you didn't. I just felt like crashin' the party.")
('Arioch', 'Grabbed myself a few party favors, too.')
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'What?!')
('Commander Geraint', 'What?!')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'Ah! Our keycards!')
('Dominion Celis', "How the hell'd you do that?! And you can't do<br/>this shit! That's gotta be breakin' some kinda rule!")
('Arioch', "Were you listenin' to a word Olympia said? The only<br/>condition for this round is gettin' twenty cards.")
('Arioch', "She never said I couldn't get in on the action and take<br/>a few of 'em, too.")
('Vice Chief Hasan', 'Bah. We should have anticipated some degree<br/>of interference.')
('Commander Geraint', 'Bah. We should have anticipated some degree<br/>of interference.')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'Yet we were too focused on the battle in front of us—<br/>leaving ourselves wide open for an ambush.')
('Arioch', "Ooh, you look mad, girl. You're free to come at me,<br/>but do you really wanna try your luck?")
('Dominion Celis', "Damn right, I do. I'm gonna hand you your ass.")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', '...Celis, I believe we should cut our losses this time.')
('Dominion Celis', "What?! Are you off your rocker?! He's one of the<br/>reasons we're here!")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'Be that as it may, our odds of defeating him are slim<br/>in our present state.')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "Also, we have not completed our analysis on the<br/>artifact's capabilities. We can't afford to be too hasty.")
('Dominion Celis', '...Fine.')
('Vice Chief Hasan', "We're at our limit, too.")
('Commander Geraint', "We're at our limit, too.")
('Arioch', "Party's over, huh? Then I'm outta here.")
('Arioch', "You guys can still go after someone else's cards.<br/>I'm not an official team, so you're not out of<br/>the game.")
('Arioch', 'All right. The next one on the list...')
('Elaine', '...is you, Arioch.')
('Arioch', "And what's a beautiful babe like you doin' here?<br/>How'd you manage to find me?")
('Elaine', 'I just analyzed your habits: the frequency of your<br/>strikes, the manner in which you pick your targets,<br/>and the distance you travel when teleporting.')
('Elaine', "With all that information at my disposal, predicting<br/>your movements was child's play.")
('Arioch', "Hot damn, that's impressive. Oh, and speakin' of hot<br/>stuff, look at you! They don't call you Beauty's Blade<br/>for nothing.")
('Arioch', "You've got guts to spare, too. Comin' after me is a<br/>ballsy play—not to mention a stupid one.")
('Elaine', "I do not make my decisions lightly. I've been lying in<br/>wait for you for some time.")
('Arioch', "Heh. Of all the gutsy women I've met, you take the<br/>cake—even if that actress is one tough cookie, too.")
('Arioch', "You were talking with Melchior about somethin'<br/>yesterday, yeah? That why you're here?")
('Elaine', 'I take it you were spying on us with the<br/>surveillance system?')
('Elaine', 'Ideally, I would like to defeat you here...')
('Elaine', "...but that isn't my primary objective.")
('Arioch', "Got'cha. Well, you can take me on if you want.<br/>There's no rule against it.")
('Arioch', 'Bear in mind, though...')
('Arioch', "...I'm not gonna go easy on ya just 'cause you're<br/>a chick.")
('Arioch', 'Try not to die on me too quickly, yeah?')
('Elaine', 'Same to you.')
('Shizuna', 'Oh, my.')
('Feri', 'I sense a large group on the other side of this door.<br/>And...I think my brother is with them.')
('Feri', 'Wait! I sense a large group on the other side of<br/>this door.')
('Feri', 'And...I think my brother is with them.')
('Risette', "...One of Marduk's top units lies beyond that door.<br/>They aren't even attempting to mask their presence.")
('Risette', 'I believe they are waiting for us.')
('Feri', "Kasim's definitely there, then.")
('Risette', 'If that is the case, then I would strongly advise against<br/>fighting them.')
('Aaron', "Oh, HELL no. We didn't come this far just to turn<br/>tail at the eleventh hour. I get they're your company<br/>and all, but—")
('Risette', "That's not what I mean.")
('Risette', 'Objectively speaking, our odds of defeating Kasim<br/>Al-Fayed are low. Dangerously so, even.')
('Van', "He's the strongest warrior alive—and maybe even<br/>who ever lived. People don't call him the Khamsin<br/>for nothin'.")
('Van', "If we take him on, we'll get slaughtered. Plain<br/>and simple.")
('Quatre', 'I-I would rather not, then.')
('Zin the Immovable', 'He might be stronger than most martial arts masters.')
('Cao', "I have heard rumors of his exceptional strength, but<br/>I've never fought him myself.")
('Shizuna', "Sounds like a challenge. Let's go for it.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "Heehee. I'm especially interested in him now since<br/>that rumor seems to have proved true.")
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Oh, the one about where he ended up? Heh. Yeah.')
('Van', "Since we have you guys with us, I wouldn't say our<br/>odds of beating them are zero.")
('Van', "But even if we somehow came out on top, we'd be<br/>dead on our feet afterwards.")
('Bergard', 'We cannot afford that risk, then. We still have to face<br/>the Almata boss.')
('Agnès', "But that won't be possible unless we get his cards.<br/>What a conundrum.")
('Van', "What's your job again, Judith?")
('Judith', "Huh? That was random. I'm an actress, which you<br/>should, uh, already know.")
('Van', 'No, not that. I mean your side gig.')
('Aaron', 'You know, the one where you dress up like a<br/>scantily-clad cat burglar.')
('Judith', "Oh, shut up! It's not THAT revealing!")
('Van', 'Sweet Aidios. Have you never looked at yourself in<br/>the mirror?')
('Judith', '...Do you want to get smacked again?')
('Quatre', "...Getting back on topic, I think I understand where<br/>you're going with this.")
('Judith', "Well, someone clue me in because I don't. What does<br/>my job have to do with this?")
('Van', "I've got a plan, and you're gonna be a part of it.")
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', 'I have been waiting for you all.')
('Feri', 'Kasim.')
('Risette', 'It is good to see you again, Mr. Al-Fayed.')
('Van', "Guess we both made it to the last day. Can't say<br/>I'm surprised.")
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', 'I can, though. To be frank, I did not expect you to<br/>have come as far as you have.')
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', "Though I'm afraid it's the end of the road for you.")
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', 'All units, prepare for battle. Assume formation C5.')
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', 'Our target is Team Arkride Solutions.')
('Van', "Guess we're gettin' right into it, then.")
('Van', "(Guh! This guy's insane! I can't keep this up<br/>for long!)")
('Van', "(But I ain't givin' up—not while I have a breath<br/>in me!)")
('Van', "To be honest, I'm a little surprised to see Marduk<br/>going all in on this.")
('Van', "They're really bettin' the ranch by sending you here.")
('Van', "After Almata showed their hand, I'd have thought<br/>you guys would play it safe—or at least hold your<br/>best playing cards closer to the chest.")
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', 'I am not at liberty to discuss corporate decisions.')
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', 'I complete the assignments I am given.<br/>Nothing more.')
('Van', "And I'll bet this one came straight from the<br/>president's office. I know you guys are<br/>pretty tight-knit.")
('Van', "I'm real curious about that. When did Marduk get<br/>into bed with 'em?")
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', 'That information is classified as well.')
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', "You sure like to run your mouth, don't you, Arkride?<br/>Almost as if you are trying to stall.")
('Van', 'Ugh!')
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', "I'm afraid your little tricks will not work on me!")
('Van', 'Gah... Now!')
('Judith', 'Haaaaah!')
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', '...Pathetic!')
('Judith', "H-He blocked my attack? But that was his blind spot,<br/>I'm sure!")
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', 'As I said, I am wise to such tricks—and I was well<br/>aware that you were with them, Grimcat.')
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', 'That is why I was suspicious when you were not<br/>among them. I anticipated foul play.')
('Judith', 'Darn. You saw through our elaborate ruse. Guess this<br/>plan was a dud...')
('Judith', '...Psych!')
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', 'Futile—')
('Feri', 'Took the bait. Hook, line, and sinker!')
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', 'Ferida?! Then Grimcat was the decoy?!')
('Van', "Ha! Fell for it! We're done here, gang. Time to bail!")
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', 'If you think we will let you get—')
('Zin the Immovable', "You wanna chase after 'em? Then you'll just have to<br/>get through us.")
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', 'Sylphid and the Immovable...')
('Fie', "We won't let you get in their way.")
('Rixia', 'Not an option.')
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', 'Yin and the White Orchid Dragon...')
('Cao', "I'm not sure how I will fare against you, but I suppose<br/>we shall find out soon enough.")
('Kurogane', 'You shall not pass.')
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', 'Ikaruga...')
('Shizuna', "We might have the same client right now, but I<br/>juuust can't pass up this opportunity to go toe-to-toe<br/>with you.")
('Shizuna', 'So what do you say? Wanna go at it for a while?')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "You've danced with them for quite a while.<br/>How about you switch partners with us?")
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', 'Ouroboros...')
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Remember that stunt you pulled a year and a<br/>half ago? I sure do. The professor totally lost his shit<br/>over it.')
('Walter the Direwolf', 'I got a good laugh outta that one. By the way, he told<br/>me to say hi if I ever ran into you. And he ordered me<br/>to give you a good thrashing, too.')
('Van', 'Whew... Glad we pulled that one off.')
('Agnès', "My heart won't stop pounding... I hope those two will<br/>manage fine without us.")
('Bergard', "They can handle themselves. I'm certain they will find<br/>an opening to escape eventually.")
('Aaron', "You were the real MVP out there, small fry. It was a<br/>treat seeing the 'world's strongest warrior' look like he<br/>just got caught shitting the bed.")
('Judith', 'For real, though. You did really well.')
('Feri', 'Heehee. It was a piece of cake!')
('Feri', "Kasim always keeps his keys and other important stuff<br/>in the same place. It's a habit of his.")
('Quatre', 'Old habits die hard, I suppose.')
('Agnès', 'And we are more than happy to take advantage of it.')
('Van', 'Yep. Good work, Feri.')
('Van', 'Okay, time to get moving. Sucks that we have to<br/>leave those two behind, but we gotta press on.')
('Feri', 'Right!')
('Elaine', 'Stop right there.')
('Van', 'Elaine...')
('Agnès', 'Wh-What?!')
('Feri', "There you are! Where've you been all this time?<br/>Fie and Zin are worried sick!")
('Judith', 'W-Wait. What are you doing here?')
('Quatre', '...I see now. Looks like the mystery of the twentieth<br/>team has been solved.')
('Aaron', "There's no way.")
('Judith', "We're looking for someone who knew we paired up<br/>with another team, right?")
('Risette', 'Ms. Bright would fit that description, but she is<br/>currently on the surface.')
('Risette', 'Which leaves only one other possible candidate.')
('Agnès', "And that's you, isn't it, Elaine?")
('Elaine', 'You found me out. Well done.')
('Elaine', 'Now, then. I will ask that you hand over your cards—<br/>or I shall take them by force.')
('Agnès', '...?!')
('Feri', 'Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on a second!')
('Quatre', "Wh-Why? I don't think we have to fight—")
('Elaine', 'I beg to differ. You have no choice but to face me.')
('Elaine', 'After all, I have a number of keycards in<br/>my possession.')
('Aaron', "Guess there's no way around it, then.")
('Bergard', 'So it seems. She is laying all her cards on the table—<br/>literally and figuratively.')
('Elaine', "That's right. I am prepared to stake everything on this<br/>battle—even my title and my rank, if I must.")
('Van', "Stay back, you guys. I'm gonna handle this<br/>one myself.")
('Van', "I'm gonna bet all my cards on this. If you beat me,<br/>they're yours.")
('Agnès', 'What?!')
('Elaine', '...Have you lost your mind?')
('Elaine', "If you believe a simple handyman like you can best a<br/>bracer of my caliber, then you've truly gone off the<br/>deep end.")
('Van', "You can quit blowin' your own horn 'cause it's falling<br/>on deaf ears. It's obvious you're totally spent.")
('Van', "What in Aidios' name left you in that sorry state?<br/>You look like you're about to drop to the floor<br/>any second.")
('Elaine', '...')
('Feri', 'Now that you mention it, her battle aura looks<br/>pretty weak.')
('Aaron', "She must've been hiding her exhaustion with<br/>controlled breathing.")
('Agnès', 'But why go to all that effort...?')
('Van', "Doubt you need me to tell you this, but by<br/>challenging all of us in your condition, you're handing<br/>victory to us on a silver platter.")
('Van', "Now, normally I'd never pass up a free meal, but<br/>beating you like that would leave a bad taste in<br/>my mouth.")
('Van', "If you really wanna challenge us that bad, you're just<br/>gonna have to settle for fightin' me and me alone.")
('Elaine', 'You really are a glutton for punishment...')
('Elaine', "You're going to regret this, Van!")
('Van', 'Hah. Better to try and fail than be a quitter.')
('Elaine', 'You are just so...frustrating sometimes!')
('Van', 'Took the words right outta my mouth,<br/>sweetheart!')
('Elaine', 'I...lost?')
('Van', "Phew. Didn't think you had that much gas left in<br/>the tank.")
('Van', "I'm amazed I eked out a win there.")
('Elaine', 'Here. These are rightfully yours.')
('System', 'Received five keycards.')
('Van', "...How'd you get your hands on five of these things?")
('Elaine', 'Well, I started with one, and I took the rest<br/>from Arioch.')
('Judith', 'Wait, WHAT?! Y-You got them from him?!')
('Risette', 'The fact that you survived is nothing short of<br/>a miracle.')
('Elaine', "I didn't exactly beat him, per se. I just took these off<br/>his person and made a hasty retreat.")
('Elaine', "Either way, I've now fulfilled my purpose in<br/>this game.")
('Van', "Huh? What're you—")
('System', "Team Beauty's Blade has been eliminated.")
('System', 'Team Arkride Solutions has acquired twenty<br/>keycards. They are now permitted to advance to<br/>the depths of the lower zone.')
('Feri', 'We did it!')
('Aaron', 'Hah! Almost time for Almata to come<br/>crashing down.')
('Quatre', "We're still good on time, too.")
('Elaine', "Congratulations. I'll now leave the rest to you.")
('Van', 'Elaine...')
('Van', 'Whoa! Easy there!')
('Elaine', "...I'm all right. I think my fatigue finally caught up<br/>to me.")
('Elaine', "I didn't expect you'd wear me down so much—let<br/>alone beat me.")
('Van', "Yeah, well, I thought it'd be a quick and dirty victory<br/>for me, but you really made me bust my ass for it.")
('Elaine', "I'm going back to the surface now. If you have the<br/>energy to make silly little comments like that, I'm<br/>sure you will do just fine.")
('Feri', 'Elaine...')
('Judith', 'She really went out of her way to help us.')
('Agnès', 'We ought to give her a proper thank you later.<br/>(But why does she look so out of sorts...?)')
('Van', '...Anyway, we got all twenty keycards now.')
('Quatre', 'Then what are we waiting for?')
('Bergard', "Once we have defeated this zone's boss, the path to<br/>the palace will open before us.")
('Aaron', "The other two haven't caught up with us, but I think<br/>we've gotta go on without 'em.")
('Van', "Yeah. Don't got much of a choice here.")
('Van', "And we also don't have all the time in the world, so<br/>let's move.")
('Melchior', 'Welcome back, my lovely partner in crime! ♪')
('Elaine', '...I have upheld my end of the deal.')
('Melchior', 'Indeed you did! Your fight against Arioch was a<br/>spectacle to behold. And your one-on-one duel just<br/>now was an unexpected—yet welcome—bonus.')
('Melchior', 'I was on the edge of my seat the whole way through.')
('Melchior', "And now I've honored my end. You may do with it as<br/>you please.")
('Melchior', "So long as you don't break any rules, of course. ❤")
('Elaine', 'Good. Now I can finally...')
('System', 'Keycards confirmed. The door has been unlocked.')
('Olympia', 'I am impressed you made it this far.')
('Olympia', 'I had calculated your odds of an early elimination<br/>before the game began. They were quite high.')
('Feri', 'Yeah, well, no one asked you.')
('Olympia', "Though whether I face you or another team makes<br/>little difference to me. The chances of winning<br/>Almata's game are low all around.")
('Aaron', "Okay, timeout. You really gotta put the brakes on the<br/>whole 'cold, calculating villainess' bit.")
('Aaron', "Why don't you try being a little more warm and<br/>cuddly for a change? It'd make you way hotter.")
('Olympia', '...Hotter? I am afraid I do not—nor care to—<br/>comprehend the meaning behind your words.')
('Aaron', "Ugh. You're no fun.")
('Van', 'Speaking of Almata, are you an actual member of<br/>their group?')
('Van', "The way you talk about 'em makes it sound like<br/>you're on the outside.")
('Olympia', 'I am not a real member, no. My affiliation is with the<br/>Gardens, and I am simply acting in accordance with<br/>the contract between us.')
('Agnès', "Sounds like your position is different<br/>from Melchior's.")
('Van', "Guess that makes sense. What I don't get, though, is<br/>why the Gardens are going above and beyond for<br/>their client here.")
('Van', "Are y'all lookin' to go down with Almata's ship?")
('Olympia', 'My purpose here is simply to carry out the orders I<br/>am given. Nothing more.')
('Olympia', 'Melchior, on the other hand, is investing far too<br/>much time and energy into this job, and Arioch is<br/>only concerned with his own amusement.')
('Olympia', 'Regardless, I do not care for what happens to Almata.')
('Olympia', 'Nor can I muster a modicum of pity for the 280,000<br/>people who may very well die today.')
('Agnès', "That's so...cruel. How can you say such a thing?")
('Risette', 'It is almost as though she is an emotionless doll.')
('Olympia', '...Hmm? Are you not the same, though? I would<br/>argue that you fit that description far better than I do.')
('Olympia', 'Your body is artificial. It was built without the<br/>inconveniences that come with flesh and blood.')
('Olympia', 'That is why I almost envy you. I wish I was blessed<br/>with a vessel as ideal as yours.')
('Risette', '...')
('Quatre', "You're...jealous?")
('Risette', 'I am satisfied—no, I am grateful for the body<br/>I possess.')
('Risette', 'However, I advise that you learn to appreciate yours<br/>as well. Do not take it for granted.')
('Risette', 'My body is, like you said, artificial—as are my<br/>sensors, which were designed to merely replicate the<br/>five senses of the human body.')
('Risette', 'Those senses—the ones that all humans are born<br/>with—are precious. They are what make<br/>people whole.')
('Risette', "Trust me when I say you don't want to lose them.<br/>And if you do, you can never get them back.")
('Feri', 'Risette...')
('Judith', '...')
('Olympia', '...I fail to comprehend your logic.')
('Olympia', 'Human beings are just biological machines.<br/>Our consciousness is akin to a system that is operated<br/>by our brains.')
('Olympia', 'We are all the same at our core. That includes you,<br/>me, and Ishtanti.')
('Aaron', 'We might as well be arguing with a brick wall.')
('Bergard', 'How pitiful. I cannot help but wonder how she came<br/>to be this way—and where that doll of hers<br/>came from.')
('Olympia', 'It is time to cut this trivial conversation short.')
('Olympia', 'Let us do battle. I, Olympia—overseer of the Garden<br/>of Aurum—shall serve as your opponent.')
('Van', "Time to turn up the heat, you guys, 'cause this<br/>stone-cold lady needs a little defrosting.")
('Van', "We're gonna get you all hot under the collar.<br/>Get ready to feel the bitter sting of defeat!")
('Olympia', "This...can't be happening.")
('Olympia', 'I am incapable of losing...and so is Ishtanti. So<br/>why...?')
('Olympia', 'Aaah... AAAAAH!')
('Van', '...?!')
('Quatre', "Something's not right here!")
('Olympia', 'Aaaaaah!')
('Olympia', '...')
('Aaron', "Okay, first she starts screaming like a raving lunatic,<br/>and now she's gone mute?")
('Feri', "Wh-What's going on here?")
('Olympia', 'Ah... So this is...who I am.')
('Olympia', 'No... NO! I know nothing of this!')
('Olympia', "It's all a lie! This isn't me! This CAN'T be me!")
('Olympia', "It hurts... It hurts so much! I can't take it anymore!<br/>Make it stop!")
('Olympia', 'I want to punch, I want to kick, I want to run, I want<br/>to fly, I want to crush, I want to touch, I want<br/>to scream!')
('Olympia', "But I don't want to move—or talk or think or listen!<br/>I don't want to do any of that! I don't want this at all!")
('Olympia', 'AAAAAAAHH!')
('Judith', "Sh-She's not making any sense at all.")
('Risette', "No... Sh-She couldn't have...!")
('Van', "She's gotten back all the emotions she was missing—<br/>and they're all hitting her like a whirlwind.")
('Agnès', 'That would explain her breakdown. But why now?')
('Bergard', 'My guess is that doll-shaped artifact has something to<br/>do with it.')
('Bergard', "It's not that she never had emotions.")
('Bergard', 'They were just being absorbed by the doll.')
('Bergard', 'After sustaining enough damage, its ability to contain<br/>her emotions was compromised.')
('Bergard', "And now they're all flooding back into her at once.")
('Olympia', "Huh? Emotions? You're saying that I had them<br/>all along? Really?")
('Olympia', 'So what am I feeling now? Is it...frustration?<br/>And sadness? All because I lost...? Wait. I...lost?<br/>But defeat means...')
('Olympia', '...death. Such is the fate for those who lose.<br/>Losers are not permitted to live. Which means I am<br/>not permitted to live. So I must die... No! NO!')
('Olympia', "I'm scared!")
('Olympia', "No, no, no! I'm scared! I'm scared! I'm scared! I don't<br/>want to die! I don't want to die! I don't want to die!")
('Olympia', "But I've done so many horrible things...and I've killed<br/>so many people. How can I possibly live with myself?!")
('Olympia', '*whimper* Aaaaaaaaahh!')
('Aaron', "She never had to come to grips with all that guilt<br/>before—and now that guilt's gonna crush her from<br/>the inside out!")
('Agnès', 'No... We have to do something!')
('Olympia', "I didn't ask for this... I can't handle this pain! It's...<br/>It's too much to bear...")
('Olympia', 'I...want to disappear.')
('Van', '...!')
('Olympia', 'My angel... Please grant my final wish... Take<br/>my life.')
('Risette', 'Oh, no!')
('Van', 'Haaaaah!')
('Agnès', 'Van! Risette!')
('Olympia', '...?! But why...?')
('Van', "You thought we'd sit tight while you tried to throw<br/>your life down the drain? Well, think again!")
('Van', "I know the pain hurts like hell—but you'll<br/>just have to live with it!")
('Risette', "You only just got your heart back, so now your life<br/>can truly begin. Embrace the truths about yourself,<br/>don't run away from them!")
('Olympia', '...!')
('Quatre', "I don't believe it's very happy with us right now.")
('Risette', 'I doubt it will cease its assault until we destroy it—or<br/>until it destroys us.')
('Risette', "It is determined to keep its master and daughter from<br/>living a normal life. And I can't accept that.")
('Judith', "You said it! She just can't let her darling baby bird<br/>leave the nest.")
('Feri', 'What a terrible mother!')
('Van', "I say it's high time we terminate its parental rights.<br/>Let's pulverize this hunk of junk!")
('Van', '(...No!)')
('Olympia', 'I have my own guardian angel.')
('Olympia', 'The people of my village revere my angel as a divine<br/>messenger in a small temple.')
('Olympia', 'Though for some reason, only I can hear its voice.')
('Olympia', 'With the passing of the seasons, the children around<br/>me disappeared without a trace—one after another.')
('Olympia', 'Then, on one fateful day, my turn came.')
('Olympia', 'My mom and dad tried to fight for me. They stood<br/>against the other adults in the village—all to<br/>protect me.')
('Olympia', "But they didn't stand a chance. Both were murdered.")
('Olympia', "'I can't go on... This pain is just...too much!'")
('Olympia', 'In that moment, I turned to the angel and made one<br/>simple wish.')
('Olympia', "'I don't want to feel anything anymore. Take it<br/>all away.'")
('Olympia', 'The angel heard my plea and responded to<br/>my request. It then began moving however I wanted<br/>it to.')
('Olympia', 'This sent the adults into a panicked frenzy.<br/>They desperately tried to separate us.')
('Olympia', 'So I killed them. And I felt nothing at all.')
('Olympia', 'I left the village and wandered outside alone. After a<br/>while, I stumbled into some rough-looking men.')
('Olympia', 'They tried to steal from me—and make me do things<br/>I had no desire to do.')
('Olympia', 'So I killed them, too. And I felt nothing at all.')
(40000, 'What an astonishing display of power! Never have I<br/>seen anyone synchronize so well with an artifact.')
(40000, 'I am the Emperor. Come with me, dear child—the<br/>Gardens shall welcome you with open arms.')
('Olympia', 'He was the overseer of the Garden of Swords.<br/>Several years after we first met, he died at the hands<br/>of two traitors he was pursuing.')
('Olympia', 'And again, I felt nothing. But I still remember<br/>something he once told me.')
(40000, "You are very much like an infant... No—you are like<br/>one who has never left her mother's womb.")
(40000, 'Your life will never truly begin until you can once<br/>again feel the emotions you now lack.')
(40000, 'And that day will never come as long as that angel is<br/>by your side.')
('Olympia', 'Ohh...')
('Olympia', 'Ishtanti... My angel...')
('Olympia', "You can't just leave me all alone... Please!<br/>Don't abandon me!")
('Olympia', "Come back! Or take me with you! I don't want to feel<br/>any of this!")
('Van', "Sorry, but your angel buddy's gone for good.<br/>Nothing's gonna shelter you from the real world now.")
('Van', "Which means you gotta reach out and get a feel for<br/>it yourself. You're a human now just like the rest<br/>of us. So it's time to start livin' a little.")
('Olympia', "But I...I can't do that...")
('Risette', 'You absolutely can. Take me for instance. I once lost<br/>everything as well, yet I managed to pull through.')
('Risette', 'You have your eyes, ears, and limbs, and you can use<br/>them to connect with and feel the world around you.')
('Risette', 'They can also help you remember what it feels like to<br/>be alive.')
('Risette', 'Your life is now yours to live.')
('Olympia', 'Alive...')
('Olympia', "That's right. I'm...alive.")
('Olympia', "I'm still hurting so much...")
('Olympia', "But I suppose that's a sign that I'm alive.")
('Feri', "She's unconscious...")
('Aaron', 'Man, she was more of a pain in the ass to deal with<br/>than before.')
('Agnès', 'Still, I think our words were beginning to reach her.')
('Van', "Yeah. Dunno if she'll ever be able to atone for all<br/>she's done...")
('Van', '...but at least now she can finally start living<br/>for real.')
('Quatre', "I hope you're right about that.")
('Olympia', "Wonderful. Now I'll never have to feel anything<br/>ever again...")
('Olympia', 'Thank you so much, Ishtanti...')
('Ishtanti', '...')
('Risette', "I hope she can finally rest in peace—even if she will<br/>not be at the Goddess' side.")
('Quatre', 'Risette...')
('Van', "(Damn it! Why the hell did I just stand there?<br/>I could've done something!)")
('Agnès', '(Van...)')
('Bergard', '(It is as I feared, then...)')
('Van', 'The lower zone boss Olympia has been defeated.<br/>Zone clear. Round three complete.')
('Dantès', 'And the winner of our game is Team<br/>Arkride Solutions. Congratulations.')
('Van', 'Dantès!')
('Bergard', "So our ever-elusive host makes his second appearance<br/>at the last minute. Didn't want to leave the final<br/>felicitations to your subordinates, eh?")
('Dantès', 'Indeed. It would be quite remiss of me to not<br/>congratulate the winners in person—so to speak.')
('Dantès', 'This game turned out to be quite the spectacle thanks<br/>to you. First, you exploited that loophole to<br/>recruit allies...')
('Dantès', '...then you defeated fearsome foe after fearsome foe<br/>using your quick wits and ample strategies. You kept<br/>me thoroughly entertained throughout.')
('Dantès', "The rest of the teams also did well to liven up the<br/>proceedings—with special mention going to<br/>Beauty's Blade.")
('Dantès', 'Oh, right. As I recall, Melchior did a brief<br/>question-and-answer session on the first day.')
('Dantès', 'Perhaps I should do the same. To commemorate your<br/>achievement, I shall answer one question of<br/>your choosing. Anything goes.')
('Van', "Heh. Wow, what an honor. I'll gladly take you up on<br/>your generous offer.")
('Van', "Here's my question: are you ready to get your face<br/>caved in, Gerard Dantès?")
('Dantès', 'Hahaha! I respect your daring spirit, boy.')
('Dantès', 'To answer your question, yes, I will be fully ready<br/>for you. I would suggest you get plenty of rest before<br/>our fight.')
('Dantès', 'The final round will begin at 3PM in Vashtar<br/>Palace—as previously noted.')
('Dantès', 'Follow the path directly ahead of you, and you will<br/>find an elevator that will take you to the center of<br/>the palace.')
('Dantès', "I shall await your arrival with eager anticipation.<br/>Find me in the throne room, and we shall commence<br/>this carnival's explosive finale.")
('System', 'Afterwards, their allies—who had been keeping<br/>Marduk occupied—finally caught up with them.')
('System', "They returned to the surface, carrying Olympia's<br/>remains with them.")
('System', 'After taking a short rest, they began preparing for the<br/>final round.')
('System', "But they were then left with a pressing conundrum:<br/>'Who should take custody of Olympia?'")
('Van', "(She might be unconscious right now, but she's still a<br/>real threat. Someone needs to keep a watchful eye on<br/>her till this is over.)")
('Van', "(And that someone can't be us. Can't afford to split<br/>my team. I should hand her over to a group with<br/>more manpower...but who?)")
('Van', "(Guess I'll let the guild handle it this time.)")
('Van', "(Guess I'll let Heiyue handle it this time.)")
('Van', '...Mind if we leave her with you guys?')
('Fie', "Sure thing. We'll take her into our custody.")
('Zin the Immovable', "We're kinda short on manpower at the moment, but<br/>I'm sure we can count on the CID for a bit<br/>of support.")
('Van', 'Cool.')
('Van', "I think handin' her over to the guild is our best bet,<br/>even if they're short-staffed.")
('Van', "I'll give Elaine a call.")
('Agnès', "Don't forget that Renne's there, too. She can help out<br/>if need be.")
('Cao', 'What a shame. And here I was, ready to pounce at<br/>the opportunity to interrogate her. Might<br/>you reconsider?')
('Van', "Yeah, no. If we left her in your hands, there's no<br/>tellin' what'd happen to her.")
('Rixia', "It's thanks to their efforts that we won at all. I don't<br/>think you have room to object here.")
('Cao', '*sigh* Indeed. Truly a pity.')
('Van', '...Mind if we leave her with you guys?')
('Cao', 'Well, this is a surprise.')
('Van', "Normally I'd have given her over to the guild, but we<br/>know they're a bit short-staffed right now.")
('Van', "Probably would be hard to work with the local cops,<br/>too, so I think this is the best option we've got.")
('Van', "First things first, though. Promise me you'll hand her<br/>over to the capital police when this is all over, or I'll<br/>find someone else.")
('Cao', 'Very well. I will do my best to adhere to that promise.')
('Cao', 'Depending on what we learn from her, however, it<br/>may not be easy to convince the powers that be to<br/>release her from our custody.')
('Aaron', 'Those damn elders...')
('Rixia', 'But I will do everything within my power to ensure<br/>she is brought to the authorities when we are done.<br/>You have my word.')
('Judith', "That's reassuring to hear, at least.")
('Fie', "...So you don't trust us with her, then.")
('Van', "What? No. I'm doing this 'cause I know you guys are<br/>stretched thin.")
('Van', "Probably would be hard to work with the local cops,<br/>too, so I think this is the best option we've got.")
('Fie', '*sigh* The truth hurts.')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Hate to admit it, but we do have a lot on our plate as<br/>it is.')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Could you do us a solid and arrange for them to hand<br/>her over to the capital police when all of this is over?')
('Van', "That's the plan.")
('Van', "I think handin' her over to the guild is our best bet,<br/>even if they're short-staffed.")
('Van', "I'll give Elaine a call.")
('Agnès', "Don't forget that Renne's there, too. She can help out<br/>if need be.")
('Aaron', "You, uh, sure that's a good idea?")
('Van', "I'm not keen on the idea, either, but the guild's<br/>stretched thin right now.")
('Van', "Probably would be hard to work with the local cops,<br/>too, so I think this is the best option we've got.")
('Van', "I'm plannin' to ask them to hand her over to the<br/>capital police when this is all over, though.")
('Agnès', "It's hard to feel at ease when Heiyue is involved...but<br/>there aren't many other viable alternatives.")
('Judith', "At least Ri—I mean, Yin is with them. She'll stop<br/>them from going too far. Of that I'm certain.")
('Shizuna', '*sigh* And after going through all the trouble of<br/>beating her up...')
('Shizuna', "I'd love to take custody of her, but I'll let this one go.<br/>You did risk your life to spare her, so it's only fair.")
('Kurogane', 'We cannot seize custody by force. Doing so would be<br/>violating the samurai code of honor.')
('Van', "Sweet. Thanks for bein' so chill about it.<br/>(Ah. So their client must be...)")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "So you're sparing the wolf who has bared her teeth at<br/>you and your flock? How foolish.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'Perhaps we ought to save you from yourselves.<br/>I hereby offer to send her to sleep with the fishes.')
('Agnès', '...')
('Van', 'Offer rejected. Keep your filthy paws to yourselves,<br/>both of you.')
('Walter the Direwolf', "Why, though? She's lost the will to go on, so she's as<br/>good as dead, if you ask me.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "You've gone soft, Arkride. Hope that doesn't come<br/>back to bite you one day.")
('Van', 'Yeah, yeah. Whatever.')
('System', "Van's team delivered Olympia into the guild's custody<br/>and returned to the surface.")
('System', "Van's team delivered Olympia into Heiyue's custody<br/>and returned to the surface.")
('System', 'After taking a short rest, they began preparing for the<br/>final round.')
(500, 'November 22nd, 3:00PM')
('System', 'Keycard confirmed.')
('System', 'Team Arkride Solutions can now enter the final zone.')
('Van', "You're a man of many talents but few words,<br/>aren'tcha, Kasim?")
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', "I'm not much of a talker, I'm afraid. I prefer to leave<br/>that role to our PR department.")
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', "I'm the one...who actually gets the job done!")
('System', 'A fearsome foe is prowling around.')
('System', 'Found <br/>.')
('System', 'Found <br/>.')
('System', 'Quest Lower Zone Extermination completed!')
('System', 'Received')
('System', 'The door is tightly locked.')
('Bergard', 'This way leads to the elevator that will take us into<br/>the palace.')
('Van', "Yeah, but the final round doesn't start until 3PM.")
('Judith', "Let's take some more time to get ready, then.")
