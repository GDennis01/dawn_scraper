('Maxim', "I'll tell you her name once we get the photo.")
('Maxim', "Sorry, but that's the best way for me to make sure you<br/>guys are good in my book.")
('Van', "Don't worry about it. That street might just go<br/>both ways.")
('Maxim', 'Huh...?')
('Quatre', 'If we get our hands on that photo, we might be able<br/>to use the net to really narrow things down.')
('Quatre', "I'm sure Risette would know the specifics more<br/>than me.")
('Risette', 'Right. We should be able to search for the woman in<br/>question using city data and license information.')
('Risette', 'There are a plethora of legal avenues we can take to<br/>identify her if we look hard enough.')
('Maxim', 'Really, now? How the times have changed.')
('Van', "Just so you know, we're not gonna cross any lines that<br/>aren't meant to be crossed.")
('Van', "And even if we do locate her, there's a chance we<br/>might not tell you.")
('Maxim', 'What?! Why not?!')
('Agnès', "Well, this is just an example, but it's possible she<br/>might have gotten married.")
('Agnès', 'In that situation, telling you her contact info might<br/>be...umm...')
('Van', "It'll come down to their situation and my judgment.<br/>And regardless of how things go, I'll be<br/>collecting payment.")
('Maxim', "Th-That's ridiculous! ...No, I suppose that makes<br/>perfect sense.")
('Maxim', "I-I see... So she might've gotten married...")
('Aaron', "What? You really thought she'd still be single?")
('Feri', "If she's as wonderful as you say, I'm sure she must<br/>have a lot of admirers.")
('Maxim', "Urgh... Yeah, you're right. If anything, it'd make<br/>MORE sense for her to be married.")
('Maxim', "Don't tell me I'm too late...?")
('Van', "We're just talkin' possibilities.")
('Maxim', "Well, if that turns out to be the case, then I swear I'll<br/>give up then and there.")
('Maxim', 'And I will, of course, pay for your services.<br/>So please—help me.')
('Van', "All right. Then let's put together a plan.")
('System', 'After that, Van split off from the group after doing<br/>the rounds.')
('System', 'He went for a cruise in his truck around the other<br/>districts, but...')
('Shizuna', 'Wow. She sure is a comfy ride.')
('Shizuna', 'I spotted her back in Longlai and Oración and really<br/>wanted to see how cozy she was.')
('Shizuna', "First up is Trion Tower, right? I'm also just itching to<br/>check out the Grand Circuit!")
('Van', 'Now LOOK here!')
('Shizuna', "Yeah? What's up, Van?")
('Van', "Let's get this straight: I am technically still on the job.")
('Van', "It's not my responsibility to give you a ride.<br/>You're not even one of my employees...")
('Shizuna', "Come on, now! I thought we were better friends<br/>than that! Don't be so cruel.")
('Shizuna', "We worked together back in Oración, didn't we?<br/>And I even stalled Marduk for you.")
('Shizuna', "Sure, we weren't exactly playing for the same team in<br/>Oración, but I did help a little, no?")
('Shizuna', "And you're not so big a fan of owing people, riiight?")
('Van', 'Ugh...')
('Van', 'I plan on driving around Trion Tower in the 3rd<br/>District, Centre Marché in the 9th District, and the<br/>Grand Circuit in the 12th District.')
('Van', "And I'll do a quick drive through the 10th and<br/>11th districts.")
('Van', "But I doubt anything's gonna happen in any of those<br/>places, so don't go complainin' about being bored,<br/>got it?")
('Shizuna', 'Yes, sir! Sounds swell!')
('Shizuna', "I'm telling you, you have no idea how annoying<br/>Kurogane can be sometimes. Nice that we can kick<br/>back without the ol' ball and chain, huh?")
('Van', "(There's no 'we' in this!)")
('Van', '...')
('Bergard', 'What an incredible spiritual aura...')
('Risette', 'I believe the wide-scale Pandemonium has reached<br/>its climax.')
('Judith', 'O-Okay, so...is it just me, or is there nobody around?')
('Feri', "Y-You're right! Even the frozen ones are gone!")
('Agnès', "It's extremely unlikely that there was nobody around<br/>for the festival.")
('Quatre', "Which means this might have something to do with<br/>what they're up to.")
('Aaron', "Leave the guesswork for later. We're closing in.")
('Van', 'Yeah. Almost at the Revolution Plaza.')
('Van', "So how're things lookin' for the school festival?<br/>All good?")
('Agnès', 'Mm-hmm! All good. We managed to put together a<br/>basic plan.')
('Agnès', "We'll leave preparations and putting together a<br/>proper budget for around the start of the new year.")
('Agnès', "I'm not just going to lean on Renne for it all, either.<br/>I'm going to give it my all.")
('Agnès', 'Oh, but I still plan to drop by the office at least once<br/>a week!')
('Agnès', "If no one's around to keep you in check, Aidios<br/>knows how questionable your diet could get.")
('Van', "Not like it'd be any different from before.<br/>Forget me—focus on your studies and the festival.")
('Van', "At least we know we don't ever have to worry about<br/>Almata coming back.")
('Van', "We've still got our fair share of unanswered<br/>questions—the Grendel, the Geneses...")
('Van', "Not much we can do but wait and see what happens.<br/>I'll probably just handle some light gigs in<br/>the meantime.")
('Agnès', 'B-But...')
('Van', 'Hey. No worries.')
('Agnès', 'Ah...')
('Van', 'Okay, sure, that thing is still inside me, and I have no<br/>clue when it might resurface.')
('Van', 'And when that time comes, I might make the same<br/>choice all over again.')
('Agnès', '...')
('Van', "But I know all too well that I've got a group of hardasses<br/>here who'd rather go through hell than leave me be.")
('Van', "So I'll think long and hard on it next time. No lie.<br/>Heh—I swear.")
('Agnès', "Heehee. Sounds awful suspicious to me. Though I<br/>might believe you if I'm allowed to help you twice a<br/>month at minimum!")
('Van', "I deserved that... Well, guess that's the best I can<br/>hope for.")
('Agnès', '...')
('Van', "Hmm? What's up?")
('Agnès', 'N-Nothing much...')
('Agnès', '(This is my first time alone in the car with Van...)')
('Agnès', "(Mmgh... Now I'm getting nervous! I've got to<br/>stay composed.)")
('Van', "Well, uhh...that's good, I guess.")
('Agnès', 'The street lights are so pretty...')
('Agnès', 'I see this place all the time, but it somehow looks so<br/>different from inside a car.')
('Van', "Right? That's part of the charm of a city at night.<br/>Especially when there're barely any cars on<br/>the expressway. It rules.")
('Van', "But coastin' through nature during the daytime ain't<br/>so bad, either.")
('Agnès', 'Heehee. My dad said something like that a long time<br/>ago, actually.')
('Van', "Huh. Really? What's your old man's verdict on cars?")
('Agnès', "Well, he doesn't love them quite as much as you do,<br/>but he used to really like going on drives.")
('Agnès', "...He's always been so busy with work, he couldn't<br/>find much time to be at home.")
('Agnès', 'But back then, once he was off, he would take me and<br/>my mother to all kinds of places.')
('Agnès', "I treasure those memories. They're irreplaceable<br/>to me.")
('Van', "Sounds like he's a real family man.")
('Van', 'Unlike a certain Z1 racer obsessed with the night life.')
('Agnès', "Ahaha... Well, Maxim regrets his actions, so I don't<br/>want to be too hard on him.")
('Agnès', '...Besides, my mother was very careful to make sure I<br/>never felt lonely.')
('Agnès', 'She would visit bookstores all across the city with me,<br/>looking for books that I would like...')
('Agnès', "...and we'd try new recipes together to surprise him<br/>when he came home late.")
('Agnès', 'I really thought those peaceful days would<br/>continue forever...')
('Agnès', '...but when she passed away, it felt like<br/>everything changed.')
('Van', 'People, places, who we are... It all changes as time<br/>goes by.')
('Van', 'But even then, you find yourself concerned with who<br/>your old man is and where he stands, huh?')
('Agnès', "Of course I do... I just don't know what he's<br/>thinking anymore.")
('Agnès', "And I don't know what I can do for him as<br/>his daughter.")
('Agnès', 'He just... He feels so far away right now.')
('Van', "I get that it's not my place to comment on someone<br/>else's family problems...")
('Van', '...but no matter how far away he might feel to you<br/>now, you still love him, right?')
('Van', 'So latch on to that feeling and face him head on.')
('Van', "The nice thing about family is that you can afford to<br/>push boundaries if you wanna figure out what's goin'<br/>on in their head.")
('Agnès', "So it's...fine to be a little selfish, then?")
('Van', "More than fine. That you're here with me as a<br/>part-timer means you're already bein' a little selfish—<br/>and I mean that in the best way.")
('Van', "So just keep doing what you're doing and pushin' and<br/>pushin', and next thing you know, you'll have your old<br/>man by the collar.")
('Agnès', "Ahaha... I think I'll skip the violence, if that's all right<br/>with you.")
('Agnès', "But...thank you. I'm feeling a little more brave about<br/>this whole thing.")
('Agnès', "Even if I don't know what the right answer is, I can't<br/>afford to wallow in negativity.")
('Agnès', 'A-And, umm, sorry for talking about my<br/>family nonstop.')
('Agnès', 'Actually, what about—err, never mind.')
('Van', "Haha. You don't gotta walk on eggshells around me.")
('Van', "It's just...I don't have any stories that'd make for a<br/>fun time.")
('Agnès', 'I see...')
('Van', "And look at that. We've hit Auber. Make sure you<br/>don't forget anything.")
('Agnès', "Oh, wow! Time really flew by, didn't it?")
('Van', 'And the drive was totally fine. Guess there was<br/>nothing to worry about.')
('Risette', 'The weight on the handling and the smooth motion<br/>of the shift lever are both perfect.')
('Risette', 'Am I right in assuming you customized both?')
('Van', "You noticed? Yeah—can't skimp on quality where the<br/>driver's concerned.")
('Van', "It's still not perfect, though, so best look forward to<br/>some sweet upgrades.")
('Risette', 'Heehee. Then I will.')
('Risette', 'Depending on your customizations, it might prove as<br/>useful food for thought while developing future<br/>armored vehicles at our company.')
('Van', "I'd rather not hear about my baby being used to<br/>develop scary shit like that...")
('Van', 'Tch. Traffic at a time like this? I took the shortest<br/>route, too...')
('Risette', 'It would appear that construction in the area is<br/>the cause.')
('Quatre', 'Not to mention the accident on the expressway.<br/>Real bad timing, there.')
('Shaheena', 'Th-This is awful...')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', '...')
('Van', "It's too early to give up.")
('Van', 'Are you guys prepared to make it no matter what?')
('Shaheena', 'Y-Yeah! Even though we really messed up!')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "We'll do anything to perform our dance for<br/>the capital!")
('Van', "Then hold on tight. I'm gonna use a back street.")
('Van', 'Is this the meeting spot?')
('Graham', "Yeah... Just beyond here is the highway we're using.")
('Graham', "But we're supposed to meet face to face right<br/>here first.")
('Junifer', "Looks like they've arrived.")
('Hermès', "Would you look at that? That's a hell of a ride.")
('Van', "Right? A lot of mira went into customizin' her.")
('Van', "This ain't gonna be an easy race.")
('Lucio', 'Hello and good evening, street racers.')
('Lucio', "I'm impressed you didn't just turn tail and run.")
('Graham', 'So you really showed up, High Bloods.')
('Lucio', "Hmm? I don't recognize those two.")
('Junifer', "Well, thanks to your biker, our cars're in the shop.")
('Junifer', "So I figured I'd call in some help.")
('Damian', 'Heh. Look at these small fry. At least TRY and make<br/>this fun for us, all right?')
('Downey', 'What?! I dare you to say that again!')
('Hyades', "Downey's all kinds of fired up now!")
('Lucio', "Now, I think it's time we reintroduced ourselves.")
('Lucio', "We're the High Bloods—a team composed exclusively<br/>of those who are elites even among the elite.")
('Van', 'Heh. Pleasure.')
('Van', 'You know, I completely forgot until you said the<br/>name, but I heard about the High Bloods a few<br/>years back.')
('Van', "Heard they were nothin' but a bunch of pampered<br/>rich kids—kinda like you.")
('Lucio', 'Ahh... You must be referring to our predecessors.')
('Lucio', 'They apparently disbanded after doing a tour<br/>of Crossbell.')
('Lucio', 'Now their name is ours.')
('Hermès', 'Huh. Is there some specific reason behind inheriting<br/>their name?')
('Lucio', "Indeed, there is. While we don't approve of the way<br/>they loved drinking, women, and gambling...")
('Lucio', '...as former nobility, we identify with how they valued<br/>their chosen bloodlines that gave them power<br/>and wealth.')
('Lucio', 'It is only fitting that we consider ourselves the true<br/>High Bloods.')
('Van', "Former nobility, eh? Been a while since I've heard<br/>anyone call themselves that.")
('Hermès', "Yeah. You don't hear that kind of thing around<br/>here much. Maybe it's because they're from Oración?")
('Van', 'Mm-hmm. Up until the noble institution was<br/>abolished during the Calvardian Revolution,<br/>Oración was the royal capital.')
('Van', "Shame that even after decades have gone by, there are<br/>still old fossils that can't throw away their<br/>elitist bullshit.")
('Tebo', 'H-How dare you?!')
('Roger', "Lucio's family line was a great noble house that had<br/>the trust of even the royal family!")
('Lucio', "It's fine. It doesn't bother me. Commoners could<br/>never hope to understand our noble thoughts.")
('Lucio', "What I cannot forgive, however, is that you people<br/>don't know your place. You insist on getting in<br/>our way.")
('Lucio', "You're nothing but an eyesore to us on our drives—<br/>and that's why we're going to make you leave the<br/>capital's streets!")
('Graham', 'You got a lotta nerve!')
('Graham', "It's a riot that you think causing trouble for folks with<br/>your reckless driving is a way to have fun.")
('Graham', 'As street racers, how could we hand these streets to<br/>you when you lack basic manners or compassion?!')
('Damian', "Heh. Just what're you getting yourself all worked up<br/>over, commoner?")
('Damian', "Just look at you and your half-assed custom ride<br/>'cause you got no mira to spend.")
('Damian', "You got no right to talk when you can't even bring<br/>out the true worth of your rides!")
('Van', 'Well, damn... You got a big mouth on you for such a<br/>little brat.')
('Hermès', "If you know so much about the 'true worth of our<br/>rides,' then why don't you teach me?")
('Junifer', "Hmph. Don't think we're just gonna take this<br/>sitting down!")
('Junifer', "It's time we settle the score. Right here, right now!")
('Graham', 'Yeah! Get ready, High Bloods!')
('Graham', "Drivers as reckless as you have got no right to call<br/>themselves street racers—so we're making this your<br/>last drive!")
('Lucio', 'It would appear we have four vehicles each, so how<br/>about we race one on one?')
('Lucio', "When you are ready, we'll leave for the expressway.<br/>Don't disappoint us.")
('System', 'And so with their street racer pride on the line, the<br/>curtain to their fierce battle rose...')
('System', 'After confirming the rules of each race one more<br/>time, each participant went right to work preparing<br/>their vehicles.')
('Junifer', "Okay, let's decide who's going to race who.")
('Hermès', 'Think I could go up against the biker on their team?')
('Graham', 'Sure thing. Just ride safe, okay?')
('Hermès', 'Heehee. But of course.')
('Van', "So who's gonna face Lucio?")
('Graham', 'Could you leave him to me?')
('Graham', "It's my job as leader to get revenge for Downey.<br/>I have to!")
('Junifer', 'Graham...')
('Van', "This race is about you guys. Whatever it is you're<br/>thinking, I'm down.")
('Van', "That being the case...you said it yourself. If you go as<br/>is, you're going to lose.")
('Graham', '...!')
('Van', "I'm not even talkin' about your driving<br/>technique, either. If we're going by specs, it's gonna<br/>be real tough for you.")
('Van', 'But—and I hate to say this—my truck could handle<br/>his ride.')
('Van', "Hell, I can promise you I won't lose.")
('Graham', 'Van...')
('Graham', 'All right. Then Van will be racing Lucio instead.')
('Graham', "We're already borrowing your skills. We might as<br/>well be in it to win it.")
('Van', "You got that right. I'll cut that spoiled brat down<br/>to size.")
('Junifer', "Then I guess that means we'll handle Lucio's<br/>two flunkies.")
('Junifer', 'If I remember right, they both came here in<br/>ETWS sedans.')
('Graham', "By the way, I've seen that Roger guy up close and<br/>personal before.")
('Graham', "I think I've got a decent idea of how he operates.")
('Junifer', 'Yeah! I knew I could count on you!')
('Junifer', "Then I'll take on the other guy, Tebo.")
('Van', "Great. Sounds like we're all squared away.")
('Van', "Once we wrap up our fine tuning, let's hit the road.")
('Downey', "We're rooting for you guys! Go kick some ass!")
('Hyades', "And please, don't get hurt!")
('Graham', 'Thanks, you guys.')
('Graham', "I promise we're gonna beat those High Bloods!")
('Junifer', "And that's that.")
('Junifer', 'This race goes to us!')
('Hyades', 'Th-They did it! You guys are amazing!')
('Downey', 'Yeah! You even surprised us! Seriously, way to go<br/>above and beyond!')
('Graham', 'Haha... Sometimes things just work out, you know?')
('Graham', 'But we really have Hermès and Van to thank for all<br/>of this.')
('Hermès', 'It was the least I could do after you came to me<br/>for help.')
('Van', "It was a close shave, but hey—I got to show off<br/>a little. So it's all good.")
('Junifer', "So, High Bloods...you're going to keep your<br/>promise, right?")
('Lucio', 'Curses... How could this have happened?!')
('Lucio', 'Our machines were tuned to PERFECTION!<br/>We were in peak racing condition!')
('Roger', "I'm sorry, Lucio... If only I'd gone faster...")
('Tebo', "I managed to win this time, but to be honest, I don't<br/>know how it'd turn out if we did a round two...")
('Damian', "Never thought I'd run into a biker as wild as her!")
('Damian', "Here I was plannin' to run circles around her, but she<br/>ended up running circles around me instead...<br/>Damn, man!")
('Lucio', 'You guys...')
('Lucio', 'Fine. As promised, we will come nowhere near the<br/>capital from this day forward.')
('Lucio', 'We will also cover the repair costs for your<br/>two vehicles... Is this to your satisfaction, commoners?')
('Graham', "I've got issues with your tone, but yeah. That works.")
('Downey', "Well, hey! That's pretty generous, actually.<br/>Maybe you're not as bad as I thought.")
('Hyades', "Bro, is that all it takes to win you over? They're the<br/>reason our cars are all busted up!")
('Lucio', "Well, now that all is said and done, it's time we<br/>returned to Oración.")
('Lucio', 'However, do not misunderstand. In no way have we<br/>recognized that our style of driving is worse<br/>than yours.')
('Lucio', 'When next we meet, you shall be met with<br/>overwhelming defeat!')
('Lucio', 'And may you never forget it.')
('Damian', "Yeah! Just you wait and see! Next time, I'm gonna<br/>blow your socks off!")
('Downey', 'Huh? Just what is all THAT supposed to mean?')
('Hyades', "I guess...they won't mess around here for a while, but<br/>they'll be back for revenge at some point?")
('Junifer', 'Wha...? Why do THEY get to decide that?<br/>What was the point of this whole deal, then?')
('Junifer', "Well, that's that. The competition ends in a tie.")
('Lucio', 'Hmph. Not what I was hoping for.')
('Lucio', 'Not when we High Bloods are far more talented than<br/>a rabble of commoners.')
('Hermès', 'It was the least I could do after you came to me<br/>for help.')
('Van', "Sorry, guys. Wish I could've done better.")
('Van', "It was a close shave, but hey—I got to show off<br/>a little. So it's all good.")
('Hermès', "Sorry. If only I'd caught up when I had the chance...")
('Graham', "It's not on you, so don't worry. Without you two, this<br/>wouldn't have even been a competition.")
('Junifer', "I hate to say it, yeah, but I couldn't have seen this<br/>going any other way.")
('Hyades', 'But then...what does that mean now?')
('Graham', '...')
('Damian', "Never thought I'd run into a biker as wild as her!")
('Damian', "Here I was plannin' to run circles around her, but<br/>she ended up running circles around me instead...<br/>Damn, man!")
('Damian', "*sigh* I'm kinda pissed off we didn't destroy them.")
('Tebo', "I managed to win this time, but to be honest, I don't<br/>know how it'd turn out if we did a round two...")
('Roger', 'I never even thought a person could drive like that.')
('Lucio', 'After a race so fierce, I suppose it would be a little<br/>uncouth not to acknowledge your skills to<br/>some degree.')
('Lucio', 'When next we meet, however you shall be met with<br/>overwhelming defeat!')
('Lucio', 'And may you never forget it.')
('Damian', "Yeah! Just you wait and see! Next time, I'm gonna<br/>blow your socks off!")
('Downey', 'Uh... What the hell is THEIR deal?')
('Hyades', "I guess...they won't mess around here for a while, but<br/>they'll be back for revenge at some point?")
('Junifer', 'Wha...? Why do THEY get to decide that?')
('Junifer', 'Aaand the High Bloods win.')
('Lucio', 'Hahaha! I knew it! Us chosen elite are far more<br/>talented than the plebeian masses!')
('Damian', 'Heh. That was more fun than I expected. Not bad for<br/>a bunch of commoners.')
('Van', "Sorry, guys. Wish I could've done better.")
('Hermès', "Sorry. If only I'd caught up when I had the chance...")
('Graham', "It's not on you, so don't worry. Without you two, this<br/>wouldn't have even been a competition.")
('Junifer', "I hate to say it, yeah, but I couldn't have seen this<br/>going any other way.")
('Hyades', 'But does this mean we have to leave the city...?')
('Graham', '...')
('Damian', "*sigh* I'm kinda pissed off we didn't destroy them.")
('Tebo', "I managed to win this time, but to be honest, I don't<br/>know how it'd turn out if we did a round two...")
('Roger', 'I never even thought a person could drive like that.')
('Lucio', 'Y-You guys...')
('Lucio', 'With our skill, we High Bloods should have wiped<br/>the floor with you commoners.')
('Lucio', 'Taking the actual race into account, our victory was,<br/>in some sense...not up to our usual standard.')
('Van', "Hah... That's admirable for you to admit in a<br/>backwards sorta way.")
('Lucio', 'Well, we have our pride as street racers, as you know.')
('Lucio', 'Still, close or not, a win is a win. That is a fact.')
('Downey', 'Which means...')
('Hyades', "We've got no choice. We went toe to toe with them<br/>and lost.")
('Graham', "Yeah... Unfortunately, we couldn't stop you guys.")
('Graham', "But even if we have to leave the city, that doesn't<br/>mean we acknowledge your style.")
('Graham', "If you still plan on driving recklessly around here,<br/>then we'll find a way to chase you out of town.")
('Lucio', 'Heh. Sore losers, I see.')
('Lucio', 'However, it will be some time before we return to<br/>the capital.')
('Junifer', 'Er, what do you mean?')
('Lucio', 'That we shall return when we become able to crush<br/>you all properly.')
('Lucio', "This isn't the end.")
('Damian', "Better be prepared, 'cause things aren't gonna go the<br/>same way next time!")
('Downey', "...What's with those guys?")
('Hyades', "In other words, we don't have to leave the capital?")
('Hermès', 'Heh. If only they were more honest with themselves.')
('Van', "*sigh* I'm glad things worked themselves out in the<br/>end, I guess.")
('Graham', "Well, it wouldn't have gone half as well if you and<br/>Hermès weren't here.")
('Graham', "There's no way this is the end of it, but for now,<br/>we've at least chased the High Bloods off.")
('Graham', 'Thanks for the help, you two.')
('Van', "It's no biggie. I enjoyed myself, so it was worth it.")
('Hermès', "Likewise. I'm happy my orbal bike skills<br/>proved useful.")
('System', "And so the battle against the High Bloods came to an<br/>end, with everyone singing praises for one<br/>another's efforts.")
('System', 'On the way back, Hermès parted ways with the<br/>group, and Graham and his people returned to the<br/>repair shop.')
('System', 'Quest Race in the Capital completed!')
('System', 'Earned')
('System', 'Received')
('Isla', '...')
('Agnès', "It's easy to just say that everything is fine.")
('Agnès', 'A little too easy, really.')
('Agnès', "So instead, even if it's only a little, I'd like it if you<br/>shared some of your worries with us.")
('Isla', 'Thank you... That means a lot to me.')
('Judith', "You don't have to force a smile, but sometimes, it's an<br/>important step to convincing yourself that things<br/>really will be fine.")
('Judith', 'That you can do it. That you can overcome the trials<br/>before you.')
('Isla', "You know, I swear I've heard your voice<br/>somewhere before...")
('Judith', "...! Really, now? Th-Though everyone out there's got<br/>a voice twin, I'm sure!")
('Van', '...Looks like this fun little chat is over for now.')
('Van', 'The first checkpoint.')
('Judith', "I didn't think they'd be watching the entrance to<br/>the expressway.")
('Judith', 'How do we get past them?')
('Van', "(No. There's a high chance we get surrounded.<br/>We should avoid taking risks.)")
('Van', 'Now, then, shall we?')
(40302, 'Where are you headed?')
('Van', "We're delivering supplies to the folks in the city<br/>continuing their peace activities.")
('Van', 'See? Even have ID. You can check out our cargo, too.')
(40302, "...It checks out. And there's no problem with your<br/>cargo, either.")
(40302, "That being said, those three women don't look like<br/>delivery personnel to me.")
('Judith', '...')
('Van', "Look, I get what you're sayin', but basing things off of<br/>gender or how someone holds themselves is a little<br/>old fashioned.")
('Van', "The four of us wanna be helpful to people in a<br/>trying time. There's no lie in that.")
('Van', "If you want, you can confirm it with our contractor...<br/>Not that I'm at liberty to say who that is.")
(40302, 'Ah... My apologies.')
(40302, 'Keep up the good work. Go on ahead.')
('Van', 'Thanks—and you, too.')
('Van', 'Oho. All together already, huh?')
('Maxim', "We've been waiting for you. I see the delivery girl is<br/>with you, too, eh?")
('Maxim', "The weather and wind direction are sublime...<br/>Perfect for a race. So let's settle the score once and<br/>for all!")
('Hermès', 'Heh. What a fascinating group of people.')
('Hermès', 'This should be good fun. Thanks for hitting me up.')
('Lucio', "And who's this pitiful-looking old fellow? He doesn't<br/>seem like he would make for much competition.")
('Jack', 'Well, SORRY for being pitiful and old.')
('Jack', 'I might not be as good as Van, but I still know a<br/>thing or two about cars.')
('Jack', "And the little lady's gonna chew me out if I report<br/>back that I lost, so I'll just have to give this my<br/>best shot.")
('Van', 'Thanks for coming, you three.')
('Aaron', 'Heh. Nice group we got here.')
('Graham', "My name is Graham, and I'm the one who proposed<br/>this little race. This here's my buddy, Junifer.")
('Graham', 'Lucio and Damian here are part of a team called the<br/>High Bloods.')
('Junifer', 'Thanks for coming together today!')
('Junifer', "I've put a lot of thought into how to make this the<br/>best race possible, so hope you get hyped for it!")
('Lucio', 'I am Lucio, the leader of the High Bloods. I came<br/>here all the way from Oración.')
('Lucio', 'Consider it an honor that you get to compete with<br/>those of us from chosen lineages.')
('Damian', 'Huh...? Wait, is it just me, or have I seen that<br/>dude before?')
('Maxim', "Erm... Ahem! I'm sure I must just have one of<br/>those faces.")
('Maxim', 'You can, uh... You can call me Max.')
('Jack', '(Wait a damn second! You never told me a pro racer<br/>would be participating?)')
('Jack', "(And not just ANY pro racer! We're talking Maxim<br/>freakin' Lugan! What did you do to get<br/>him involved?!)")
('Van', "(Let's just say we have an unexpected connection.)")
('Junifer', "(Ahaha... You're something else, Van.)")
('Graham', "('Max,' eh? That's not even subtle, but probably better<br/>to keep my mouth shut.)")
('Van', "We're supposed to have one more person, but, well...")
('Van', "...maybe we're better off without. Time to get started.")
('Van', 'Gah... I know the sound of that engine...')
('Walter the Direwolf', "Heheh. 'Sup, Arkride? Didn't mean to keep<br/>you waiting.")
('Van', "Oh, not to worry. You could've kept me<br/>waiting FOREVER.")
('Van', 'Seriously, nobody asked you to be here, so why ARE<br/>you here?')
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Because I heard about some good shit going<br/>down, obviously.')
('Walter the Direwolf', "I'm kinda hurt you'd throw a fun event like this<br/>without me!")
('Damian', 'Wow. This guy seems tough.')
('Jack', "This group's getting more ridiculous by the minute...")
('Aaron', 'Haha! This should be a bigger deal with all these<br/>monsters we got together last minute. Talk about<br/>a lineup!')
('Graham', "Umm... So can I assume you'll be participating<br/>as well?")
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Yeah. You brats better make it worth my while!')
('Junifer', "Ahem... Anyway, let's get down to the rules!")
('Junifer', "We're going to be pulling out into the expressway for<br/>some high-speed, unrestricted races.")
('Junifer', 'The prize for the winner is the experience of getting<br/>to drive like a damn psycho. The loser gets a<br/>special punishment.')
('Junifer', "Now we'll be splitting you all into two teams!")
('Graham', 'Not really sure how to go about splitting us<br/>up, really...')
('Graham', '...but I DO know we want to compete against the<br/>High Bloods.')
('Agnès', 'Hmm... What if we split the rest of the participants<br/>up as assistants?')
('Agnès', 'Everyone else can join either of the existing teams.')
('Feri', 'Oh! What if the other participants assist the two<br/>teams, then?')
('Feri', 'Some can join the street racer team, and some can<br/>join the High Bloods!')
('Aaron', 'I got an idea, then. What if we spread the rest of the<br/>participants across both teams?')
('Aaron', 'They can join either the street racer team or the High<br/>Bloods as temps.')
('Risette', 'In that case, what if we were to have the other<br/>participants assist both sides?')
('Risette', "They can provide their skills to either your team or<br/>the High Bloods'.")
('Quatre', 'I know. What if the others joined each team<br/>as helpers?')
('Quatre', 'They can join either the street racer team or the High<br/>Bloods as temps.')
('Judith', 'Well, then, what if the rest of the participants are<br/>split up between the two teams?')
('Judith', 'They can be temporary helpers for each team.')
('Bergard', 'Hmm... In that case, what if the other participants<br/>assisted the two teams?')
('Bergard', 'We could have them join either the street racers or<br/>the High Bloods.')
('Van', "Yeah—sounds good to me. Keeps us from havin' to<br/>come up with fancy names for the teams, too.")
('Lucio', 'True enough.')
('Lucio', 'Then in terms of numbers, three should join the<br/>High Bloods.')
('Lucio', "Five versus five—which means we'll be doing five<br/>one-on-one races.")
('Damian', 'So who will be joining the High Bloods?')
('Maxim', 'Hmm... Well, what side do you plan on joining?')
('Van', "I'm contracted with the street racers, so I'll be<br/>joining them.")
('Aaron', "Then it's the same for me. Not that I would've<br/>minded racing Van.")
('Graham', 'Ha! Good to have you both on the team.')
('Maxim', "Then I'll be joining the High Bloods.")
('Maxim', "Sorry, but I've been meaning to settle the score<br/>between us.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "I don't care either way. Lots of interesting folks here.")
('Hermès', 'Likewise.')
('Jack', 'Same here.')
('Junifer', 'Sounds to me like this should be decided at random!')
('Van', 'Oho. Ready for anything, huh?')
('System', 'Using the lottery system Junifer brought with her,<br/>each individual then pulled to see what team they<br/>would be on.')
('Graham', 'That settles it, then.')
('Graham', "So our street racer team's got Van, Aaron, Hermès...")
('Graham', '...and then me and Junifer.')
('Lucio', 'As for we High Bloods...')
('Damian', 'Is it just me, or are we loaded with sketchy old farts?')
('Jack', "Keep workin' that jaw if you don't enjoy living, kiddo.")
('Junifer', "You know, if there's someone in particular you'd<br/>prefer racing with, we don't mind.")
('Junifer', "As for the order of the races, I'll be deciding those<br/>at random.")
('Junifer', 'First up is Aaron versus Damian. Second is Graham<br/>versus Jack.')
('Junifer', 'Next will be Hermès versus Walter.')
('Junifer', "Then it's the fourth race with me versus Lucio.<br/>This one I HAD to make happen.")
('Junifer', "I'm just so over being on the losing end of things!")
('Lucio', "Hmph. Fine. Come at me, then, young lady. I'll leave<br/>you in the dust!")
('Junifer', "Ha! That's my line!")
('Junifer', 'Graham, you know what to do.')
('Graham', 'You got it. I was just thinking that this would<br/>be perfect.')
('Lucio', '...?')
('Junifer', 'Ahem! Anyway, that makes the final race between<br/>Van and Max!')
('Junifer', 'Good luck to the both of you!')
('Maxim', "Time to show you what it means to be a pro.<br/>Still, let's make this a good one.")
('Van', "Oh, it'll be good, all right. I've modded my truck<br/>quite a bit since our last race, so you'll see what she's<br/>about soon.")
('Van', "You'll be in for one hell of a surprise.")
('Agnès', "I'll wait here for you to come back safely, then.")
('Agnès', 'Take care—all of you!')
('Van', 'You got it. Catch you later!')
('Feri', "Then I'll wait right here for all of you!")
('Feri', 'Best of luck to both teams!')
('Van', 'You got it. Catch you later!')
('Risette', "In that case, I'll wait here for your return.")
('Risette', 'Good luck to both teams.')
('Van', 'You got it. Catch you later!')
('Quatre', "I'll wait here, then.")
('Quatre', "Honestly, I'm a little worried about you guys ignoring<br/>the speed limit...")
('Quatre', '...but no point in worrying about that now. Good luck<br/>out there.')
('Van', 'You got it. Catch you later!')
('Judith', "I guess I'll wait here, then.")
('Judith', "Honestly, I'm kind of worried about you ignoring the<br/>speed limit...")
('Judith', '...but no point in crying over spilled milk, as they say!<br/>Go kick some butt out there!')
('Van', 'You got it. Catch you later!')
('Bergard', 'Then I will wait here for your return.')
('Bergard', 'May both teams give it their best out there.')
('Van', 'Right. Catch you later!')
('System', 'And so the fierce battle between bike and car lovers<br/>alike began, their pride fiercely on the line.')
('System', "It wasn't long before they were on the expressway,<br/>with the first racers lining up to begin a race for<br/>the ages.")
('Agnès', "I'm glad things turned out so well! Looks like you had<br/>some great races.")
('Feri', 'Good job, guys! Looks like you had fun.')
('Risette', 'Well done. From what I can see, you had some<br/>wonderful races.')
('Quatre', "Glad you're all back. Seems like you guys had a<br/>good time.")
('Judith', 'Hey, guys. Looks like you had some good races, huh?')
('Bergard', 'Well done, all of you.')
('Bergard', 'It looks to me like you had yourselves a few<br/>good races.')
('Graham', 'Whew... Yeah. It was pretty crazy, but there were<br/>some real nail-biters.')
('Junifer', "Tell me about it! That was the craziest race I've had<br/>since becoming a street racer!")
('Junifer', 'Both teams did amazing, but a winner is a winner.')
('Junifer', 'And this time, the winners are the street racers!')
('Junifer', 'Heh! Good work, guys!')
('Graham', "It's too bad I lost, but I was still blown away by the<br/>driving I saw out there.")
('Aaron', 'What can I say? It feels good to win.')
('Aaron', "I might've lost my own race, but winning overall sure<br/>does feel good.")
('Van', "Yeah. It's a rush to just give it everything you got.")
('Hermès', "I honestly didn't expect this to be as satisfying as<br/>it was.")
('Hermès', "It almost feels like I've gotten even better thanks<br/>to this.")
('Lucio', 'Urgh... We lost? The High Bloods?!')
('Damian', 'Damn it! How could this have happened?!')
('Damian', "We couldn't ask for a better race, and you're telling<br/>me it's already over?!")
('Lucio', 'Ugh...')
('Lucio', "...But I suppose I'd have to agree.")
('Jack', 'So long as you gave it your all, then it is what it is.')
('Jack', "Losing would normally piss me off a little, but I<br/>don't know. I feel weirdly cool about it.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "I don't give a shit about the team—I just ain't happy<br/>about losin' MY race.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Hope you're ready, rider chick. You, too, Arkride.")
('Hermès', 'Heh. I welcome the challenge.')
('Van', "Careful, Hermès. This ass doesn't lay off once he's<br/>locked on.")
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Yeah? Well, right back at you.')
('Hermès', "Phew... I gave it all I had, but it wasn't enough.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Eh, I don't give a shit about the team race.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "You're next, Arkride. Better prepare yourself.")
('Van', "I'd be lyin' if I said my interest wasn't piqued, but I'm<br/>sure as hell not gonna race you.")
('Maxim', 'You pulled out all the stops for that one, huh?')
('Maxim', 'If you ever went pro, you might even make for a<br/>decent rival.')
('Maxim', '*sigh* I won my race, but we still lost as a team...')
('Maxim', "Still, you were incredible out there! Things could've<br/>gone either way at the drop of a hat.")
('Maxim', 'If you ever went pro, you might even make for a<br/>decent rival.')
('Van', 'Well, thanks.')
('Van', "Your handling is just as incredible as I've heard.")
('Junifer', 'And the winners are: the High Bloods!')
('Lucio', 'We won? I know I should be thrilled, but somehow...')
('Damian', "What? Individual races aside, we won the team race,<br/>so what's the problem?")
('Damian', "I don't know about you, but I've never been so<br/>desperate to win during a race before.")
('Damian', 'The rest of the team also showed some serious skill!<br/>Like, this is what you call REAL racing!')
('Lucio', 'Hmph. True enough. Those were indeed some<br/>incredible races.')
('Jack', "I sure as hell didn't expect things to get so heated.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Can't say I'm pleased I lost my race.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Hope you're ready, rider chick. You, too, Arkride.")
('Hermès', 'Heh. I welcome the challenge.')
('Van', "Careful, Hermès. This ass doesn't lay off once he's<br/>locked on.")
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Yeah? Well, right back at you.')
('Hermès', "Phew... I gave it all I had, but it wasn't enough.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "You're next, Arkride. Better prepare yourself.")
('Van', "I'd be lyin' if I said my interest wasn't piqued, but I'm<br/>sure as hell not gonna race you.")
('Maxim', 'You pulled out all the stops for that one, huh?')
('Maxim', 'If you ever went pro, you might even make for a<br/>decent rival.')
('Maxim', 'Whew! Felt pretty good about that one. That was<br/>one of my better times.')
('Maxim', "Still, you were incredible out there. Things could've<br/>gone either way at the drop of a hat.")
('Maxim', 'If you ever went pro, you might even make for a<br/>decent rival.')
('Van', 'Well, thanks.')
('Van', "Your handling is just as incredible as I've heard.")
('Aaron', "I'm not happy with the results, but I am pretty<br/>satisfied I got to put gramps' bike through its paces.")
('Graham', 'Yeah. I lost, too, but I still had a ton of fun.')
('Junifer', "Mm-hmm! Almost feels like I've grown a bit from<br/>the experience, you know?")
('Junifer', "Now, then...it's time for your punishment!")
('Junifer', "I'm gonna get things ready, so give me just a sec!")
('Maxim', 'Is this...tea? It smells kind of like medicine...')
('Van', "Is this...tea? It's got that medicinal kind of smell to it.")
('Junifer', "Yup! It's a medicinal tea sold in Langport.")
('Junifer', "It's supposed to be super bitter, but don't worry—it's<br/>not bad for you.")
('Junifer', "Man, I didn't think I'd end up having to drink<br/>this stuff...")
('Lucio', 'No point in delaying the inevitable. Time to accept<br/>our fate and drink up.')
('Damian', 'Augh! I just know this is gonna taste awful!')
('Graham', "I guess I'll suck it up and give it a try.")
('Van', '...')
('System', 'All members of the losing team steeled their resolve<br/>and drank the tea.')
('Lucio', 'BLEEECH!')
('Lucio', "Is this really good for you? I can't believe humans<br/>were meant to drink this swill!")
('Damian', 'And it stinks, too! Smells like weeds!')
('Damian', "Ugh... I think I'm gonna blow chunks...")
('Maxim', "I've tried some gross things for my health before, but<br/>this here takes the cake...")
('Jack', "Y'know...the more you drink, the better it tastes?")
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Heh. You brats are too young to savor this<br/>kinda flavor.')
('Van', "Oh, c'mon! You're boring me to tears. At least give us<br/>SOME kinda reaction.")
('Aaron', "Oh, I bet we'd get a great reaction if you gave it a sip.")
('Van', "Like hell I'm tryin' this crap.")
('Graham', "Urgh... I-It's so bitter...")
('Junifer', 'Blegh! This is terrible! Why did I buy this stuff<br/>again...?')
('Hermès', 'Funny. I kind of like it. Feels nice and healthy to me.')
('Aaron', "I've had drinks like it, but can't say I'm the<br/>biggest fan.")
('Aaron', "...Wait. You've got a sweet tooth, right? Then what<br/>about this stuff?")
('Van', 'Guh...')
('Aaron', 'Huh?')
('Van', 'BLEEEGH! THIS IS BITTER AS SHIT!')
('Van', 'H-How are you guys okay?!')
('Van', "Ugh... Does anyone got any water?! I can't get the<br/>taste outta my mouth...")
('Hermès', '...This sounds bad.')
('Aaron', 'Not a fan, eh?')
('Maxim', 'An excellent match rendered moot.')
('Walter the Direwolf', "Hahaha! That's what you get, brat.")
('Van', "Quit laughin' it up and GET ME SOME WATER!")
('System', "And so the race surrounding the street racers' pride<br/>came to an end.")
('System', 'Both parties reflected deeply on the intense battles<br/>that took place on the road before returning to where<br/>they belonged.')
('System', 'Quest The Autobahn Showdown completed!')
('System', 'Earned')
('System', 'Received')
