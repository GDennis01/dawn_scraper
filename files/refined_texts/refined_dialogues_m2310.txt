('Elaine', "Given how dilapidated this place has become, it's<br/>hard to imagine it as a once-bustling mining hub.")
('Elaine', "I see it's mostly composed of concrete. How old is<br/>this facility?")
('Van', "'Bout eighty years old, I think.")
('Van', 'Far as I understand it, this place was like a town—<br/>families and all.')
('Aaron', '...')
('Agnès', "Are you sure you're all right?")
('Feri', "If you're hurting, we may be able to help...")
('Aaron', "Don't sweat it. The doc's salve will hold me over till<br/>we're done here.")
('Aaron', "If anything, I'm more raring to go than ever.")
('Van', 'If you say so.')
(40301, 'EEEEEK!')
('Elaine', 'A scream!')
('Agnès', 'Could it have been one of those women that were<br/>with Maxim?!')
('Feri', 'It came from deeper in...')
('Van', 'Wait!')
('Aaron', "The hell's wrong with them?")
('Feri', "I can't sense the breath of life from them at all!")
('Agnès', "Th-Then it's just like...")
('Elaine', 'The phenomenon Alvis described!')
('Aaron', "Hold up! When'd this turn into a horror flick?!")
('Van', 'Fight first! Talk later!')
('Agnès', '...')
('Feri', 'Dear Arusha...')
('Aaron', "If this is a joke, I'm not laughing...")
('Elaine', 'This matches what I was told of the incident in Creil.')
('Elaine', 'Jaegers who were supposed to have died two weeks<br/>prior reappeared and, when defeated,<br/>vanished completely.')
('Elaine', "How much do you really know about what's going<br/>on here?")
('Van', "All I can say is that this has got Almata's stench all<br/>over it.")
('Van', "And judgin' by what they had cooking last time,<br/>they're clearly up to some messed up shit here, too.")
('Elaine', "...All right. We'll leave it at that for now.")
('Elaine', "We still need to confirm the safety of those who<br/>wandered into here. Let's get moving.")
(40301, 'S-Somebody! Help!')
('Aaron', "They're surrounded!")
('Agnès', "We're too late!")
('Van', 'Elaine!')
('Elaine', 'Right!')
('Feri', 'Whoa...')
('Aaron', '*whistle* Leave some for me!')
('Aaron', 'Scoot back to safety, ladies.')
(40302, 'Okay!')
('Elaine', "Well done. Let's finish this!")
('Van', 'Yeah!')
(40301, "W-We can't possibly thank you enough. You saved<br/>our lives.")
(40302, "I never thought that one day I'd be saved by the<br/>famous Beauty's Blade—or by Aaron, for that matter!")
('Aaron', "All in a day's work.")
('Van', "Where's the champ at? He was with you, yeah?")
(40301, 'Well...we made the mistake of telling him about<br/>this place.')
(40301, 'As soon as we were done, he wanted to come explore<br/>it with us.')
(40302, 'B-But then all those...monsters showed up.')
(40302, 'Maxim lured them away so we could escape.')
('Feri', 'Huh.')
('Agnès', 'He did?')
(40302, 'Please save him! He should be further inside.')
('Elaine', 'Of course. Bracers have a sworn duty to uphold the<br/>safety of the citizenry.')
('Van', "We ain't so noble, but we'll help out so long as he<br/>pays us back for the service.")
('Agnès', 'Not this again...')
('Aaron', "You two stay close to me. I won't let those monsters<br/>harm a hair on your heads.")
(40301, 'R-Right!')
(40302, "We won't fall behind!")
('Elaine', '(Look at him go.)')
('Feri', '(The power of attraction in action...)')
('Van', '(Bah. Smug little punk.)')
('Agnès', "(Come on, this isn't the time for this. Let's<br/>get going!)")
('Agnès', "I hope she'll be all right on her own...")
('Van', "Don't worry. She ain't an A-rank for nothin'.")
('Aaron', "Well, well. Someone's being unusually trusting.")
('Feri', 'I will believe in her strength.')
('Feri', 'Not again!')
('Van', 'They can make it show up inside, too, huh?')
('Agnès', 'Oh...')
('Aaron', "All right, the bracer's gone, so it's about time you<br/>spill it.")
('Aaron', 'Why does your bag always light up when the<br/>fog appears?')
('Aaron', "So you're saying the reason why that fog showed up<br/>and those thugs turned undead...")
('Aaron', "...is all because Almata's got a device like that one?")
('Van', "That's our best guess, anyway.")
('Agnès', 'It looks like they obtained it from a trading stall at<br/>the port.')
('Aaron', 'Hmm. Judging by what Pao and Ouran said, this fog<br/>showed up forty years ago, too.')
('Aaron', 'Would that mean...? Hmm.')
('Van', "No use standin' around here. The answers are waitin'<br/>up ahead.")
('Feri', 'And those two Almata leaders as well!')
('Aaron', "Right. Let's find that 'Genesis' thing and finish this!")
('Viola', "That Melchior doesn't care at all about helping us,<br/>does he?")
('Viola', "I'll never understand what the boss sees in him.")
('Alexandre', "If he can survive a battle with Beauty's Blade, that is<br/>evidence enough.")
('Alexandre', "Regardless, these four arriving ahead of schedule<br/>shouldn't disrupt our plans.")
('Aaron', 'That right? Sounds like you have more planned than<br/>just a scuffle with Heiyue.')
('Agnès', 'And what do you intend to do with that device?')
('Viola', "Wouldn't you like to know?")
('Viola', "We're not about to give up that info without a<br/>fight, though.")
('Alexandre', "We can use this chance to gauge the strength of the<br/>Eastern Quarter's resident fighter and that<br/>corporation's arm.")
('Alexandre', 'Perhaps you will even be enough to warm us up<br/>before our bout with Heiyue.')
('Aaron', "Come too close to the fire and you're gonna<br/>get burned.")
('Feri', "What did he mean by 'arm'?")
('Van', "Someone did their research. He's talkin' about this.")
('Alexandre', 'Several years ago, people were recruited to test that<br/>weapon: the stun caliber.')
('Alexandre', 'However, despite its potential, it was deemed too<br/>difficult to use for the average warrior to wield.')
('Alexandre', 'I never expected to meet one in actual combat.')
('Van', "Speakin' of weapons, that's a gnarly pair of gauntlets<br/>you got there.")
('Van', 'North Ambrian make if I had to guess.')
('Alexandre', 'Hmph.')
('Viola', 'Good grief. You men and your obsessions<br/>with weapons. The important part is if it can kill<br/>someone or not.')
('Viola', 'I do love how my needlegun takes down<br/>targets, though.')
('Viola', 'Poking a big, strong man full of holes is just the best!')
('Viola', 'Still, tearing a doll like blondie to shreds has its<br/>charms, too.')
('Agnès', '...')
('Feri', 'That kind of talk has no place on an<br/>honorable battlefield.')
('Van', 'Keep your defensive shards handy. Should be able<br/>to repel her needles some.')
('Aaron', "I'm so done listening to these crazy people run<br/>their mouths.")
('Aaron', "I've got a thousand reasons to smash your faces in:<br/>revenge, keeping this city safe...")
('Agnès', '...?!')
('Van', '...')
('Aaron', "...but more than anything, I've got a score to settle<br/>with myself.")
('Aaron', "It'd be better if I could do this alone, but I'll do<br/>whatever it takes to see this through!")
('Viola', "Hahaha! Fine! Let's get to the good part early!")
('Alexandre', 'Bring all of your anger and resentment to bear<br/>against us!')
('System', 'Received the Carabia holo core.')
('Aaron', 'RAAAAAH!')
('Viola', 'Whoa!')
('Alexandre', 'Ngh!')
('Aaron', 'You. Will. PAY!')
('Agnès', 'A-Aaron...')
('Feri', 'All that anger...')
('Van', "Don't lose control of yourself.")
('Van', 'You might be giving them exactly what they want.')
('Aaron', 'What?!')
('Van', "Earlier she said fighting us was 'the good part.'")
('Van', "If their goal really is wipin' out Heiyue, that's a pretty<br/>weird thing to say, ain't it?")
('Aaron', '...')
('Viola', '*sigh* Me and my big mouth.')
('Viola', "Let's get everyone on the same page.")
('Viola', 'First off, we have to talk about a bit of history—a<br/>fairy tale, if you will.')
('Agnès', 'Wh-What?')
('Aaron', '...')
('Viola', "It's a tragic legend passed down in Langport's<br/>Eastern Quarter.")
('Viola', 'In times of great turmoil, a mythic being will appear.<br/>Sometimes it takes only a few decades—and others,<br/>as long as a century.')
('Viola', 'The being of unparalleled strength and charisma<br/>always subjugates the Eastern people—<br/>including Heiyue.')
('Alexandre', 'He is a warrior, a liberator, and a dictator.')
('Alexandre', 'And most of all...a demon.')
('Alexandre', 'Stricken with fear, the people all began to refer to<br/>him as...')
('Alexandre', "...the 'Tyrant.'")
('Aaron', '...!')
('Agnès', 'I recognize that name...')
('Feri', 'The old woman at the church mentioned it.')
('Van', "Some part of this city's history that the elders want<br/>kept quiet, huh?")
('Van', 'The last one had to have appeared a long time<br/>ago, right?')
('Viola', 'Indeed.')
('Viola', "It's been about forty years since the last<br/>Tyrant appeared.")
('Viola', 'They say compared to his predecessors, this one was a<br/>cut above.')
('Viola', "He took control of that era's Heiyue and Yin and<br/>used them to rule Langport following the chaos of the<br/>Orbal Revolution.")
('Viola', 'Under him, Easterners gained a greater foothold in<br/>the Republic.')
('Viola', 'In some ways, he reminds me of our boss.')
('Alexandre', 'However, his rule did not last.')
('Alexandre', "The Tyrant's rule was predicated on reason<br/>as much as it was fear.")
('Alexandre', 'His strict, rational decision-making did improve the<br/>lives of his subjects, but it also ignored the distress of<br/>those adversely affected.')
('Alexandre', "Over time, the accumulated distress evolved into a<br/>full-blown panic. Yet Calvard's government did<br/>not intervene.")
('Viola', 'So the elders of Heiyue chose to rebel.')
('Viola', 'To defeat the demon they so revered, they enlisted<br/>the help of Yin and outsiders—pride be damned.')
('Viola', 'After a bloody battle, they managed to seal the<br/>Tyrant away.')
('Viola', 'He drew his last breaths in solitude here at Heilong<br/>Cheng Zhai.')
('Agnès', 'Th-That all really happened?')
('Van', 'So that whole story about sealing up the mines was<br/>just to keep people out, huh?')
('Aaron', 'No way... But that would mean...')
('Feri', 'Aaron?')
('Van', 'Get a grip, man!')
('Alexandre', 'It appears our intel was accurate.')
('Alexandre', 'Aaron Wei, you are the new Tyrant.')
('Feri', 'What?!')
('Agnès', "It can't be...")
('Aaron', "Don't mess with me!")
('Aaron', 'I was born and raised in Langport by my mom!')
('Aaron', "She may have died and left me an orphan, but I've<br/>lived a great life here!")
('Aaron', "I won't let you make that all out as the work of some<br/>old wives' tale!")
('Viola', 'Heheh. Come on, now.')
('Viola', "Tell me that you didn't feel it the moment you set<br/>foot in here.")
('Aaron', '...!')
('Viola', 'This facility, its floors and walls, even this throne...<br/>None of it feels familiar?')
('Aaron', 'Ugh...')
('Aaron', "Wh-Why...? No! That...isn't me...")
('Feri', "He's broken out into a sweat!")
('Agnès', 'Are you okay?!')
('Van', "So that's been your game all along.")
('Alexandre', 'Correct.')
('Viola', "All that's left is the last push!")
('Agnès', '...!')
('Feri', 'The third Genesis!')
('Viola', 'Sorry, kids. This is for him!')
('Aaron', '...?!')
('Alexandre', 'That object was sealed here along with the<br/>previous Tyrant.')
('Alexandre', "At long last, it has returned to its master's grasp.")
('Van', 'Oh, shit...')
('Agnès', 'Aaron!')
('Van', 'Throw it away! Now!')
('Aaron', 'AAAAAAARGH!')
('Feri', "Wh-What's happening?!")
('Van', "His memories are comin' back!")
('Agnès', 'Aaron...?')
('Alexandre', 'That name no longer suffices.')
('Alexandre', 'Before you stands a greater being: the demon known<br/>only as the Tyrant.')
(61255, 'RAAAAAAGH!')
('Agnès', 'Ngh!')
('Feri', '...!')
('Viola', "Hahaha! Get a load of this guy! He's even better than<br/>I was hoping for!")
('Alexandre', 'The first phase is now complete.')
('Alexandre', 'Next, he will destroy Langport and the Eastern<br/>Quarter of his own accord.')
('Feri', 'No way...')
('Van', "So that's what this is all about.")
('Viola', "It's time for Heiyue and the Tyrant to duke it out just<br/>like they did forty years ago!")
('Viola', 'But this time he has that Genesis thing with him,<br/>meaning he can turn his kills into undead servants!')
('Viola', "Heiyue may be powerful, but they'll never<br/>withstand THAT!")
('Alexandre', 'The guild, police, and navy will surely join the fray<br/>as well.')
('Alexandre', "Making use of the confusion, we will have a chance to<br/>slip in and eliminate Heiyue's elders.")
('Agnès', "That's horrible...")
('Van', "Tch. Nothing's too low for these guys.")
(61255, 'GRR...')
('Viola', "Whoa! Someone's raring to go!")
('Alexandre', "I see. Despite transforming, he's retained his<br/>resentment toward us.")
('Alexandre', 'Some small part of his previous self remains<br/>within him.')
('Viola', 'Perfect. His two souls fighting for control will make<br/>him even stronger.')
('Viola', 'This town will truly become the Dazzling City once it<br/>goes up in flames!')
('Alexandre', 'This is your last chance to leave.')
('Viola', "Hurry and scamper away, and maybe you'll live to<br/>fight another day!")
('Van', "So, what'll it be?")
('Feri', 'I will stand and fight!')
('Agnès', "I'm worried about the Genesis, but right now Aaron's<br/>more important!")
('Van', "Had a feelin' that's what you'd say.")
('Van', 'Agnès! Go contact Elaine and Heiyue! Me and Feri<br/>will buy you time—')
('Van', '...?!')
('Agnès', 'Ahh!')
('Feri', 'Agnès!')
('Van', "No, you don't!")
('Van', 'Hyaaa!')
('Van', '...?!')
('Van', 'Gah!')
('Agnès', 'Van!')
('Feri', 'Look! The Genesis!')
('Van', "Damn. Kid's got some moves...")
('Mare', 'Do you like getting beat up or something?')
('Van', "Ugh... Like hell I'd do this for fun!")
('Feri', "She's back!")
('Agnès', 'Mare!')
('Mare', "Oh, geez. You're up against a real dangerous one<br/>this time. What's the plan?")
('Van', "You even need to ask? Let's do this, Mare-Bear!")
('Mare', "All right! Doin'—WHAT did you just call me?!")
('Agnès', 'Please wait, Mare! Let me fight alongside him!')
('Mare', 'Are you really interrupting me? I need to do my<br/>bit first!')
('Mare', "Shard swell! The Grendel's all yours!")
('Feri', "It's just like in Creil!")
('Agnès', 'I can feel myself resonating with Van through<br/>the Genesis...')
(61255, 'RAAAAAAH!')
('Van/Grendel', 'HRAAAAAH!')
('Agnès', '...!')
('Feri', 'We did it!')
('Van', '*pant* *pant* Looks like we...got him...')
('Agnès', 'Thank you, Van.')
('Feri', 'Everything should be okay now, right?')
('Van', 'Yeah. We just need to—')
(40501, 'RAAAAAAH!')
('Van', "Bah. Looks like that thing hauntin' him isn't gonna<br/>give up so easy.")
('Agnès', 'Oh, no...')
('Feri', 'But we already used our strongest weapon!')
('Aaron', "Sometimes it feels like the world's fading away<br/>around me.")
('Aaron', "I'll see my bros or Ashen—hell, even the city lights—<br/>and my vision just kinda...hazes over.")
('Aaron', 'It makes me sick.')
('Aaron', "Screw all of that! I've got to protect this place!")
('Aaron', "I've got to prove to myself that I belong here! That all<br/>my doubts are bullshit.")
('Aaron', 'Mom loved this town so much. And so did<br/>my friends...')
('Aaron', 'So please! Help me kick those bastards out of our<br/>town and make things right!')
('Van', 'Aaron Wei! Listen up!')
('Agnès', 'Van?')
('Feri', "Back up! He can't hear you anymore!")
('Van', "If you're still in there somewhere, open your<br/>damn eyes!")
(40501, 'I... I AM...')
(40501, 'THE TYRANT... RULER OF LANGPORT...')
('Feri', "I-It's working?!")
('Agnès', 'Aaron must have heard his words.')
('Van', "You ain't some Tyrant! You're Aaron Wei!")
('Van', "Langport's prodigy! The Little Conqueror!<br/>The Eastern Quarter's favorite troublemaker!")
('Van', 'Where do you get off being a cocky runt all the<br/>damn time and then just forgetting everything?!')
(40501, 'I MUST FIGHT... MUST GUIDE...<br/>MUST RULE...')
(40501, 'THAT IS MY EVERYTHING—MY DESTINY.')
('Van', '...')
('Van', 'SHUT THE HELL UP!')
('Van', "Don't give me that destiny garbage!")
('Van', "It's your life! Don't let some old-ass demon tell you<br/>how to live it!")
('Van', 'What happened to the guy who loves Langport with<br/>all his heart?!')
('Van', 'You told me you were gonna keep it safe. Safe for<br/>everyone who loves it like you do!')
('Van', "Did you forget?! You're just gonna let some monster<br/>waltz in and trash it?!")
(40501, '...')
('Agnès', "Aaron! There are so many people who care about<br/>you—you mustn't forget that!")
('Agnès', "Not only Ashen, Halle, Jack, and the members of<br/>Heiyue—it's everyone living in the Eastern Quarter!")
('Agnès', "They're all waiting for you to come back home!")
('Feri', "It's not really my place to speak for them...")
('Feri', '...but I know your friends would be calling you<br/>back, too!')
('Feri', "So, please, don't give up!")
('Van', 'Letting destiny and that bastard sweep you along is<br/>the easy way out.')
('Van', "You're just running away! What happened to proving<br/>that you belong here?!")
('Van', "I guess you just don't have what it takes. Do ya?!")
(40501, '...')
(40501, '...YOU...')
(40501, 'YOU THINK...THIS WILL STOP ME?')
(40501, 'WHO THE HELL...DO YOU THINK...I AM?')
(40501, 'ARGH... I AM...')
(40501, '...AARON WEI!')
(40501, 'AAAAAARGH!')
('Aaron', '...')
('Agnès', 'He...did it.')
('Feri', 'The evil spirit has vanished.')
('Van', 'Heh. Nice work, kid.')
('Van', "Teach that thing who's runnin' the show.")
('Agnès', 'Oh, thank goodness...')
('Feri', 'I could sense two souls within him.')
('Feri', 'He must have defeated the demon.')
('Aaron', '*cough* *cough*')
('Feri', 'Aaron!')
('Agnès', 'Are you all right?!')
('Aaron', 'Yeah... I think so...')
('Aaron', 'What happened to the Tyrant?')
('Van', 'Got his ass beat. Now you can go back to being<br/>a brat.')
('Van', 'But a brat that managed to save this town.')
('Aaron', 'Haha... I did, huh?')
('Aaron', '...')
('Agnès', "It's finally over...")
('Feri', "Without the Tyrant's help, Almata doesn't stand a<br/>chance of beating Heiyue.")
('Feri', 'They should be pulling out of the city soon.')
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', 'You all fought admirably.')
('Aaron', 'Lǎo Yéye...?!')
('Feri', 'Wh-What are you doing here?')
('Agnès', 'Oh! He must have brought reinforcements.')
('Van', '...')
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', 'Indeed. We only just arrived.')
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', 'I had to be sure we had a sufficient force in the event<br/>that you might fail.')
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', 'However, I see my fears were unfounded.')
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', 'Rest assured, you will be suitably compensated for<br/>what you have done this day.')
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', 'Now then, a boat is waiting down below to return you<br/>to the city. Allow us to handle the remaining<br/>business here.')
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', 'As for you, Aaron, come with me. Your wounds are<br/>deep, and we have much to discuss.')
('Aaron', 'Hah. And for a second there I was happy to see<br/>you, too.')
('Aaron', "Fine, fine. Let's get this over with.")
('Agnès', "(Heehee. All's well that ends well, I suppose.)")
('Feri', "(Yeah. I'm glad they get to talk like this.)")
('Van', 'Hold up.')
('Aaron', '...?')
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', 'Is something the matter, spriggan?')
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', 'If it concerns your compensation, my son will handle<br/>that matter in my stead.')
('Van', "Good to know, but actually, it's somethin' else.")
('Van', "Say, you were in cahoots with Almata, weren't you?")
('Aaron', 'What?!')
('Feri', 'H-Huh?!')
('Agnès', 'Wait, then...')
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', '...')
('Van', 'I have no doubt that you truly are enemies<br/>deep down.')
('Van', "Had a battle broken out, I'm sure you woulda gone all<br/>out on 'em.")
('Van', "That said, I think you guys ended up findin'<br/>something you agree on.")
('Van', "Somethin' that only you and the other elders would<br/>know about.")
('Feri', 'You mean...?')
('Aaron', "No way... You've gotta be shittin' me.")
('Agnès', "I'm reminded of a certain phrase you used: 'Let<br/>external woes reveal internal wounds.'")
('Van', "Obvious one is the external woe bein' Almata.")
('Van', '...But that makes the internal wound the Tyrant here.')
('Aaron', '...!')
('Van', "I've got plenty of circumstantial evidence for<br/>my theory.")
('Van', "First, there's the story of how a certain device got into<br/>the hands of a street merchant and eventually Almata.")
('Van', 'Shortly after someone gave it to the merchant, it<br/>happened to be stolen by a bunch of thugs.')
('Van', "Timing's awfully convenient, ain't it?")
('Van', "And don't forget only Heiyue knew that device was<br/>sealed away here.")
('Feri', 'Why not just hand it over directly?')
('Agnès', 'Plausible deniability. They can pass the whole affair<br/>off as a mistake if they get caught.')
('Aaron', '...')
('Van', "Second, there's those Almata guys knowin' way too<br/>much about the Tyrant and what went down here.")
('Van', "Only the old folks around here even know it<br/>happened, but if you ask 'em about it, they clam up<br/>real quick.")
('Van', "So how did a bunch of young outsiders hear about<br/>a local taboo? Must've had a source.")
('Feri', 'Oh...')
('Aaron', 'Lǎo Yéye...?')
('Van', "Third, there's the old man's attitude toward<br/>Aaron here.")
('Van', 'Sounds like you all used to get along real well, his<br/>mom included.')
('Van', "Don't know what it is about the kid, but people really<br/>take a shine to him—'specially old folks like you.")
('Van', "So why'd you suddenly turn cold on him?<br/>There's gotta be a reason.")
('Aaron', "He's full of it...right?")
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', 'All three of his assertions are correct.')
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', "Despite Cao's recommendation, I did not expect you<br/>to be quite this perceptive, spriggan.")
('Aaron', 'Why would you do that?!')
('Aaron', 'You were so kind to us!')
('Aaron', 'Mom loved you like family!')
('Aaron', 'What changed? When did you start seeing me<br/>so differently?!')
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', 'The signs began to appear in recent years.')
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', 'The last Tyrant was a charismatic young man, just<br/>like you.')
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', 'With each passing year, you came to resemble him<br/>more and more.')
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', 'I had no choice but to discover the truth—no matter<br/>the cost.')
('Aaron', 'Hold on... Did you know my friends and the town<br/>were going to be in danger this whole time...?')
('Aaron', 'Answer me!')
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', 'We did not intend for a tragedy to take place, but we<br/>understood the risks well.')
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', 'I deeply regret that innocent people lost their lives.')
('Aaron', 'They... They died for THIS?!')
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', 'Such was the will of Heiyue. If you dislike the system<br/>that reached this conclusion, then use your right to<br/>change it.')
('Aaron', '...What?')
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', 'Chaos and trials unknown lie ahead, that much<br/>is certain.')
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', 'But if you are there to guide us, Heiyue will<br/>undoubtedly overcome them all.')
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', 'We need you to be the great, unfeeling Tyrant.')
('Van', "So you're just lookin' for someone to take the burden<br/>of leadership away.")
('Van', "But that someone's not even the man himself.")
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', 'Correct. That is what is best for Heiyue.')
('Feri', 'The xiongshou!')
('Agnès', 'H-Have they been here this whole time?')
('Van', 'Bah...')
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', 'Take him away.')
('Rixia', 'Enough.')
('Agnès', '...?')
('Feri', "Who's that...?!")
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', "Yin. If you're here, that means...")
('Fan', 'Please stop this, Father.')
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', "I see you've disobeyed my orders and returned<br/>early, Cao.")
('Cao', 'This is purely by coincidence, I assure you.')
('Cao', 'Negotiations went so smoothly, I was afforded the<br/>chance to come lend you my aid.')
('Ashen', "Yéye, please stop! Hasn't Aaron suffered enough?!")
('Aaron', 'Ashen...')
('Agnès', "Elaine, you're all right!")
('Elaine', "Yes, and I'm glad to see you all in one piece.")
('Elaine', 'Melchior got away, but thankfully Maxim and his<br/>companions are safe now.')
('Van', "Got'cha.")
('Elaine', 'I think I have a rough understanding of the<br/>situation here.')
('Elaine', "I have no intention of meddling in Heiyue's internal<br/>affairs—however, I must see to the safety of<br/>this civilian.")
('Elaine', 'The guild will not stand idly by and allow you to<br/>detain this young man.')
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', 'Ah... I see.')
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', "With Beauty's Blade and Yin on your side, I dare say<br/>our advantage has dissolved.")
('Rixia', "I believe we're still on even footing.")
('Elder Gien (Hawaiian Shirt)', 'So Mond crafted a worthy successor after all.<br/>Perhaps you will even surpass him given time.')
('Rixia', 'You flatter me.')
('Elaine', "(She's become stronger in the last year and a half.)")
('Fan', "Father, I was aware of the Tyrant situation, but I'm<br/>shocked that the elders stooped to working with<br/>our enemies.")
