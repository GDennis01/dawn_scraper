('System', 'The second race was between Graham and Jack.')
('System', 'Graham decided to trade cars with Junifer for<br/>the race.')
('System', 'As such, it was a battle between sedans from Red Star<br/>and Leno.')
('System', 'The specs between the two vehicles were nearly the<br/>same, and both drivers were at similar skill levels.')
('System', 'At first, they were neck and neck, but Jack gradually<br/>widened the gap between them—driving almost as if<br/>he could predict the future.')
('System', 'By the time Jack crossed the finish line, he was<br/>significantly in the lead.')
('System', 'After that, it was time for the third race to begin.')
('Walter the Direwolf', "Hell yeah. Now it's my time to shine! You better not<br/>make this too easy for me, woman!")
('Hermès', "Wouldn't dream of it.")
('Hermès', "I can tell you're no ordinary racer, so I trust that you<br/>know how to put a bike through its paces.")
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Hah! You got that right!')
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Outta the way!')
('Hermès', 'Sorry! Coming through!')
('Van', "I'm gettin' a headache just looking at that guy.")
('Aaron', "Can't relate. I'm keeping my eyes peeled in case he<br/>gets sick of the traffic and starts smashing cars.")
('Junifer', "Oh, please. There's no way he's strong enough to do<br/>that...right?")
('Van', 'That was a kickass race.')
('Aaron', 'No kidding. Watching that makes me wanna get<br/>behind the wheel and go riding again.')
('Van', "You're up, Junifer. Get on out there and show 'em<br/>who's boss.")
('Junifer', 'Will do!')
('System', 'Next up was a fateful confrontation between Junifer<br/>and Lucio.')
('System', "Junifer borrowed Graham's Ingert sports car for<br/>the race.")
('System', 'Meanwhile, Lucio drove a top-of-the-line ETWS<br/>sports car.')
('System', 'Its higher top speed gave Lucio the advantage.')
('System', "However, Junifer, who knew her vehicle's quirks like<br/>the back of her hand, was hot on his tail the whole<br/>way through.")
('System', "In the end, Lucio's nerves got the better of him, and<br/>he fumbled a corner at the last stretch of the race—<br/>giving Junifer a well-deserved victory.")
('System', 'Thus, it was time for the fifth and final race<br/>to begin...')
('Maxim', "If you think I'm gonna go easy on you just because I<br/>owe you one, think again! Now's my chance to give<br/>you a taste of my revenge!")
('Van', "Maxim may be a complete buffoon, but he's still a<br/>racing champion.")
('Van', "If I don't pull out all the stops, I'm gonna lose.")
('Maxim', 'Now, then. Let the rematch of the century...begin!')
('Van', "Why's he lettin' me get ahead? Does he want to see<br/>what my girl can do?")
('Van', "Well, I'll gladly show him! Time to bust out my<br/>secret weapon!")
('Maxim', 'Gotta admit. The way he handles that pickup truck<br/>is impressive.')
('Maxim', "I'll bet five thousand mira he'll use that<br/>turbocharger next.")
('Maxim', "But I'm going to stop that plan in its tracks!")
('Van', 'Damn it!')
('Maxim', "I know what your car's capable of now. The element<br/>of surprise isn't on your side anymore!")
('Van', "Guess I'll just have to make a risky play!")
('Van', 'Haaaaaah!')
('Maxim', "Grr...! Don't think you've won!")
('Van', "Don't underestimate me, champ!")
('Maxim', "Haha. I'm impressed you managed to shake me off.<br/>However, it won't be enough to beat me!")
('Junifer', 'He did it! Van won!')
('Jack', "Haha. He might be on the other team, but even I feel<br/>like standin' up and clappin' for him.")
('Graham', "Van's insane! Who knew he was such a skilled driver?!")
('Junifer', 'Looks like Max clinched it.')
('Jack', 'Van did his best, but beating a Z1 champion was a<br/>tall order.')
('Graham', "I'll give him an A+ for effort, though!")
('Maxim', 'I-Is he insane?!')
('Van', "Off-roading's pretty damn fun. You should give it<br/>a try!")
('Van', "Oh, but I guess your fancy sports car ain't gonna be<br/>able to handle it. Too bad!")
('Van', 'Time to blast to the finish line!')
