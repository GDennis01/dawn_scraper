('Alexandre', 'Welcome, players.')
('Alexandre', 'I am Alexandre, the boss of round two.')
('Alexandre', 'Melchior already laid out the rules for advancing, so I<br/>have nothing more to add on that point.')
('Alexandre', 'I will note that only five teams were eliminated<br/>yesterday, which was well below our expectations.')
('Alexandre', 'You will have four hours to complete this zone.<br/>Our hope is that only half of you will make<br/>it through.')
('Alexandre', 'In this round, you will need six keycards to advance.<br/>May the best team emerge victorious.')
('Agnès', "We have three from yesterday, so we just need to get<br/>three more. It's essentially the same deal as before.")
('Risette', 'Our competition will be much fiercer, however.<br/>We may be fighting a more uphill battle to<br/>acquire them.')
('Aaron', 'Cool with me. I like a good challenge.')
('Bergard', "I would prefer to exercise caution. We can't afford to<br/>fight everyone, so we should pick our battles wisely.")
('Feri', 'The more our opponents fight and eliminate each<br/>other, the better.')
('Risette', 'The fighting has already begun, it seems.')
('Van', "Probably won't be long till we run into another group,<br/>so be ready to fight at a moment's notice.")
('Agnès', 'Right!')
('Feri', "Holy crap. There's a fierce battle going on in there.")
('Quatre', 'I can sense spiritual reactions, too.')
('Van', 'Seems like one group is significantly larger than<br/>the other.')
('Bergard', 'I know that sound... It can only belong to one type<br/>of sword!')
('Dominion Celis', 'Haaaaah!')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'Celis!')
('Dominion Celis', "Tch. Did someone chop your balls off or somethin'?<br/>Knock it off with those chickenshit strategies and<br/>fight me like a man.")
('Ashladd', 'We will continue to use any and all tactics at our<br/>disposal until our path to victory is secure.')
('Ashladd', "Taking advantage of your foe's weaknesses is key, and<br/>we know you're a raging bull who can only<br/>understand the language of brute force.")
('Dominion Celis', "That's it. You've just landed the top spot on my<br/>shit list!")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'Calm yourself, Celis. They only taunt you because<br/>deep down, they know the truth of the matter:')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'No matter how many monks they bring or plans they<br/>devise, defeating us is a statistical impossibility.')
('Ashladd', '...')
(40451, "Hmph. We'll see about that.")
(40452, "Sir, I believe now's the time fo—")
('Dominion Celis', "Oh, I know that much, Leon, and that's exactly why<br/>I'm so confused.")
('Dominion Celis', "You're part of the Iscariot unit, ain'tcha? Then why<br/>didn't you tell the Congregation for Divine Worship<br/>about what you're doin' here?")
('Dominion Celis', 'Just what the hell are you thinking?')
('Ashladd', "We have no obligation to inform you of our reason<br/>for being here. And for the record, we know not of<br/>this 'Iscariot' of which you speak.")
('Ashladd', 'We are merely humble travelers whose curiosity led<br/>us to this place. Is that explanation satisfactory?')
('Dominion Celis', "Hell no! I'm not buying that for a second!")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', '*sigh* Our commander requested that we avoid<br/>quarreling with you wherever possible...')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'But if a fight is what you want, who are we to say no?')
('Ashladd', "I would rather not, but I'm afraid I see no<br/>other choice.")
('Ashladd', 'It is a pity. I would much prefer the Holy City not<br/>lose two of its precious Dominions.')
('Dominion Celis', "Don't get ahead of yourself. You don't got a<br/>snowball's chance in HELL of beating us.")
(40451, '...!')
(40452, "It's their Stigmas...")
('Ashladd', 'Careful. The signs of the fourth and the eleventh are<br/>capable of immolating and freezing all in their path.')
('Ashladd', 'We have no choice but to pull out our secret weapon.')
('Dominion Celis', 'Huh? What is that?')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'It looks to be a multiplex spiritual mark, which is<br/>made manifest using their Xiphas.')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'I presume that is the fruit of your research into our<br/>own blessings. But how will it measure up to the real<br/>thing, I wonder?')
('Ashladd', 'We will know shortly. Now is as good a time as any<br/>to test it out.')
('Bergard', 'All of you—stay your weapons!')
('Dominion Celis', 'Huh...?!')
('Ashladd', '...!')
('Van', "Master! What're you doin'?!")
('Aaron', "That's one way to make an entrance.")
('Dominion Celis', 'Welp. He found us.')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'Father Bark—I mean...Master Bergard.')
(40451, 'Is it...really him?')
(40452, 'Then the rumors were true...')
('Ashladd', '...')
('Bergard', '*sigh* I am no longer associated with the church, so<br/>my words will not hold sway in this matter...')
('Bergard', '...but I still have a few thoughts to share as an<br/>outsider looking in.')
('Bergard', 'All of you represent either the Dominions or the<br/>monks, both of whom worship the same Goddess.')
('Bergard', "One would expect the church's elites to join hands<br/>and serve as a united front—confronting the present<br/>crisis as a collective unit.")
('Bergard', 'Yet all I see is schoolkids bickering on a playground.<br/>Is this how members of the church<br/>conduct themselves?')
('Dominion Celis', "Damn it. I don't got a comeback for that one.")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'Nor have I... I trust you have no qualms with putting<br/>our differences aside?')
('Ashladd', 'We had no desire to fight to begin with, but we have<br/>even less of a desire to work with the likes of you.')
('Dominion Celis', 'You wanna run that by me again, asshole?')
('Ashladd', 'However, we recognize the folly of fighting to our<br/>mutual destruction.')
('Ashladd', "We shall take our leave. May we meet again when<br/>this 'game' of theirs has reached its end.")
('Ashladd', "I, too, had heard talk of your survival. It's good to see<br/>you are alive and well, Master.")
('Bergard', 'Heh. Nice to see you, too.')
('Dominion Celis', "We'd only learned he was still alive the other day...")
('Dominion Celis', "...but it sounds like they've known for a while now.")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'Indeed. And I have a good idea as to who their source<br/>is as well.')
('Van', "Glad I wasn't the only one outta the loop.")
('Van', "So, uh, could we pass on a fight this time? Not up to<br/>fightin' a Stigma user right now—let alone two<br/>of 'em.")
('Dominion Celis', "Yeah, that's cool. I kinda don't wanna go up against<br/>Master Bergard anyway.")
('Dominion Celis', "Though you aren't gettin' off so easy next time. If you<br/>find us in the final round, prepare for hell on earth.")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "A pity. I would very much like to give you 'hell on<br/>earth' this very moment.")
('Van', '...Excuse me?')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'Still, that can wait for after this is over.')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'I sincerely doubt I could beat you while you have the<br/>guild by your side, so we shall bow out for now.')
('Zin the Immovable', "I'm good with not fighting you guys, too.")
('Fie', 'Same here. I met one of the guys in your group<br/>during that whole thing with the tower last year.<br/>He was a big help.')
('Dominion Celis', 'Is that right? Huh.')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "You were leading another unit at the time, so it's no<br/>surprise you weren't aware of that.")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'I sincerely doubt I could beat you while you have<br/>Heiyue by your side, so we shall bow out for now.')
('Rixia', "I would rather avoid a scuffle as well. A friend of<br/>Wazy's is a friend of mine.")
('Cao', 'You can be mine as well. Perhaps we should take this<br/>chance to become a little better acquainted.')
('Aaron', '*sigh* You really doing this crap now?')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'I doubt I could beat you while you have the strongest<br/>jaegers in the East by your side.')
('Dominion Celis', "It's a damn shame. Would've loved to spar with ya.")
('Shizuna', 'Same! But my companions here do oh-so love playing<br/>it safe.')
('Kurogane', 'And they are wise to do so.')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'Though it is a rare opportunity to find the two of you<br/>in one place...')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "We'll spare you this time, though, but only because<br/>Master Bergard is with you.")
('Dominion Celis', "Today's your lucky day. We're letting you off easy this<br/>time, old man.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Cool. I wasn't in the mood to kill a couple of<br/>snot-nosed kids anyway.")
('Dominion Celis', "...Never mind. We're throwin' hands, jackass.")
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Come at me anytime, girlie.')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "It's always so lovely to see people getting along<br/>so well.")
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Like hell we are!')
('Judith', "Phew. Well, that could've ended a lot worse.")
('Agnès', 'We can count on the church to act more sensibly than<br/>many of the other participants, I think.')
('Quatre', "Yeah. They are more likely to put the civilians' safety<br/>before their pride—not unlike the guild.")
('Bergard', "Yes, I suppose that's true.")
('Bergard', "But remember, Iscariot's goal is to exact swift<br/>punishment to Almata for their mounting sins.")
('Bergard', 'We may very well find ourselves on the opposing end<br/>of their blades later on.')
('Risette', 'I am inclined to agree with his assessment.')
('Aaron', "If it comes to that, we'll take them down. They'll have<br/>to grin and bear it 'cause we're after Almata's<br/>throats, too.")
('Van', "If we wanna beat 'em, we need those keycards, and<br/>we haven't got any yet today. Time to hustle, team.")
('Feri', 'Yes, sir!')
(500, 'Meanwhile...')
('Ashladd', "I'll admit, we underestimated you and your men,<br/>Kasim Al-Fayed.")
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', "I understand the battle with the knights wore you<br/>down, but even I can see the wind hasn't been<br/>knocked out of you entirely.")
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', 'I suggest you push a little harder. Otherwise, you may<br/>not live to regret it.')
('Ashladd', 'You are not our primary target. We have an ace in the<br/>hole, and we would be fools to show you our<br/>full hand.')
('Ashladd', 'You seem to be under the impression that we are the<br/>ones who are cornered.')
('Ashladd', 'Allow me to dispel that illusion right here and now.')
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', '...?!')
(40454, "Another of Iscariot's units is on our six!")
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', 'So, you split your team in half from the start. A<br/>clever deception.')
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', 'You clashed with the knights as one unit to mask<br/>your true numbers from the other teams... Or perhaps<br/>you intended to mislead us specifically?')
('Ashladd', 'Up to this point, we only showed our right hand.<br/>We kept our left firmly in the dark so we could pull it<br/>out at the opportune time.')
('Ashladd', 'There are many formidable foes here—Heiyue,<br/>Ikaruga, and the society included. But you are<br/>without question the greatest threat of them all.')
('Ashladd', 'That was why we led you here, using ourselves as bait.<br/>And now the tables have turned.')
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', 'I commend your strategy, but you are once again<br/>underestimating us. You should have taken your own<br/>words to heart.')
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', 'Men, switch from formation A6 to A4! Maintain fire<br/>on the targets while doing so!')
(40452, 'Sir!')
('Ashladd', 'Your men are well trained, but I cannot fathom the<br/>meaning of that formation.')
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', 'Objective changed from encirclement to suppression.')
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', 'The buster lance limiter has been disabled.')
('Ashladd', 'What is he up to...?')
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', 'Men, stay out of the line of fire!')
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', 'I will end this in one fell stroke.')
('System', 'Team Iscariot A has been eliminated.<br/>Team Iscariot B has been eliminated.')
('Bergard', 'Ashladd and his men have fallen?')
('Judith', 'For real? But they seemed so strong...')
('Aaron', 'Since when did they have two teams? And they both<br/>lost at once? How?!')
('Risette', 'It is possible their battle with the two Dominions left<br/>them in a rather precarious state.')
('Risette', '(If both units were eliminated at the same time, then<br/>it may be his handiwork...)')
('Alexandre', 'Today, seven teams have been taken out of the game,<br/>leaving seven—no, eight remaining.')
('Alexandre', "It won't be long now before one of you has enough<br/>keycards to advance.")
('Alexandre', 'Muster up your courage and come face me in the<br/>depths—if you dare.')
('Quatre', "One moment. The numbers he gave don't add up.")
('Quatre', 'Twelve teams have been eliminated—seven today and<br/>five yesterday—and there are eight remaining.')
('Quatre', 'That would mean there are twenty teams, and that<br/>does not match the number they gave at the start.')
('Feri', "Right... They said there were nineteen, didn't they?")
('Agnès', 'Which begs the question: where did the other one<br/>come from?')
('Van', 'He had to correct himself on that earlier.')
('Van', "Either he can't do basic math, or a new team has<br/>entered the scene. The latter's more likely to me.")
('Judith', "That's not fair. They can't just add teams after the<br/>game's already begun!")
('Van', "I don't think they're 'adding' anything, actually.")
('Van', 'There were supposed to be twenty teams from the<br/>start, remember?')
('Van', 'Each underground entrance had one keycard<br/>allocated to it...')
('Van', '...and every team got a card that was registered in<br/>their name, which they could use to open their<br/>assigned entrance.')
('Van', 'But one of those entrances went unused. And<br/>that was...')
('Zin the Immovable', '...the one we were meant to use!')
('Van', "Yeah. Everyone was workin' under the assumption<br/>that the guild was using that entrance.")
('Rixia', '...the one we were going to use!')
('Van', "Yeah. Everyone was workin' under the assumption<br/>that Heiyue was using that entrance.")
('Shizuna', '...the one we were going to use, right?')
('Van', "Yeah. Everyone was workin' under the assumption<br/>that Ikaruga was using that entrance.")
('Walter the Direwolf', '...ours. So someone stole it, eh? Bold move.')
('Van', "Yeah. Everyone was workin' under the assumption<br/>that the society was using that entrance.")
('Van', 'Of course, you guys had already snagged its keycard at<br/>the time.')
('Van', 'Though it probably became invalid once you joined<br/>our team.')
('Van', "My theory's that the surveillance system issued<br/>another once that happened.")
('Quatre', "Oh. I didn't even think of that.")
('Agnès', 'The surveillance system favors fairness above all else.')
('Agnès', 'So it logically follows that if someone obtained that<br/>newly issued replacement keycard...')
('Aaron', "...they'd've been registered as the twentieth team.")
('Feri', 'So now we have another team to worry about...')
('Bergard', "If it was a violation of the rules, we would've been<br/>informed of it this morning, which tells me this must<br/>be a loophole.")
('Bergard', "I haven't a clue as to their aim, but I can't help but be<br/>impressed by their ingenuity.")
('Risette', 'If we take all of these facts into account, there are<br/>only a few possible candidates.')
('Risette', 'It must be someone we met in the game that knew<br/>about us joining forces with another team.')
('Quatre', "Yet another mystery to add to the pile. That's the last<br/>thing we need right now.")
('Van', '...')
('Agnès', "(Wait... It couldn't be...)")
('Van', "Well, there's no point stressin' over it. If they're<br/>starting out today, they're gonna be short on cards.")
('Van', "We've already got the six we need, so we just need to<br/>book it to the end of the zone.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'True enough.')
('Aaron', 'Time to put that soldier boy outta commission.')
('Judith', "Let's do this thing, you guys.")
('Feri', "We better hurry. The time limit's creeping up on us,<br/>so let's get moving!")
('System', 'Keycards confirmed. The door has been unlocked.')
('Alexandre', "So, Team Arkride Solutions is the first to arrive<br/>once again. I certainly didn't anticipate that.")
('Feri', '...!')
('Quatre', "You're one of the people responsible for the incident<br/>in Basel...")
('Aaron', 'About time we settled the score, you son of a bitch.')
('Alexandre', 'I never imagined fate would bring us together<br/>once more.')
('Alexandre', "It's almost as if our destinies were meant to<br/>be entwined.")
('Van', "Probably wasting my breath askin' this, but you<br/>mind surrendering? It'd save us a lot of trouble.")
('Alexandre', 'Never.')
('Alexandre', 'I have yearned to find a place where I can die—and<br/>now that I have, I do not intend to submit so readily.')
('Risette', 'He has taken the drug enhancement!')
('Aaron', 'How can you not feel a lick of shame using that crap?')
('Feri', "Don't you have any pride? I thought you were<br/>a soldier!")
('Alexandre', "I've long since abandoned that path, and I have no<br/>need to cling to a soldier's code of honor.")
('Alexandre', 'I left that all behind the moment I murdered my own<br/>father and betrayed the man I swore to serve.')
('Agnès', 'What?')
('Judith', 'You...did what now?')
('Alexandre', 'My lord was among the vilest of men.')
('Alexandre', 'He cared not for anyone but himself. When his own<br/>country turned to salt and collapsed, he turned his<br/>back on his people and fled.')
('Alexandre', 'My family—his royal guardsmen—followed suit.<br/>I was only five at the time. My father trained me in<br/>martial arts so that I could serve our master.')
('Alexandre', 'Though as my lord grew in age, so, too, did his greed.<br/>He longed to reclaim his home...')
('Alexandre', '...and his moment arrived when a leader of the<br/>Northern Jaegers, who ran the country in his absence,<br/>fell in battle.')
('Alexandre', 'He seized the moment to begin his conquest—<br/>moving to occupy the city of Haliask. He ordered us<br/>to assist.')
('Alexandre', 'His lofty ambitions had no hope of coming to<br/>fruition, though. We quickly found<br/>ourselves surrounded.')
('Alexandre', 'As we scoured for any means of escape, our lord gave<br/>my father and I another order—forge an opening by<br/>slaying our poverty-stricken countrymen.')
('Alexandre', 'That was one order I could not carry out. I may not<br/>have lived in the city for long, but they were still<br/>my people.')
('Alexandre', 'My father sensed my hesitation and branded me<br/>a traitor. Then, he challenged me to a duel to the<br/>death—even though he did not wish to do so.')
('Alexandre', 'I fought like my life depended on it, weaving between<br/>strikes from his iron fists and trading blow for blow.')
('Alexandre', "In the end, I was the victor. As my fist pierced his<br/>chest, his final words were 'be a prisoner no more.'")
('Alexandre', 'Then...I fled. I abandoned my master and became a<br/>soulless wanderer. I lost everything—my people, my<br/>home...and the place where I was meant to die.')
('Alexandre', 'Then five years ago, I met my new master here<br/>in Calvard.')
('Bergard', 'I...see. So it all began with the Salt Pale crisis thirty<br/>years ago...')
('Van', "You were there when that all went down, weren't<br/>you, Master?")
('Agnès', 'The people of North Ambria are finally beginning<br/>life anew, but they had to endure so much to<br/>get there.')
('Judith', "It's such a sad story.")
('Fie', "That must've happened shortly after Sara's dad<br/>passed on.")
('Feri', 'Your former master sounds like the scum of the earth.')
('Aaron', "That's putting it lightly. He was a real piece of shit,<br/>by the sounds of it...")
('Aaron', "...but you don't get to use him or that sob story as an<br/>excuse for what you've done. Not on my watch.")
('Alexandre', 'I know. My hands are stained with the blood of<br/>many innocents.')
('Alexandre', 'My path was set in stone from the moment I first<br/>encountered my master.')
('Alexandre', 'He is a man who lives to spread fear wherever<br/>he walks. He may as well be a reaper in<br/>human form...')
('Alexandre', '...and that is the perfect kind of master for a fiend<br/>who murdered his own father in cold blood.')
('Alexandre', 'He saw right through me. He knew I was looking for<br/>a place where I could die, and he promised to grant<br/>my wish.')
('Aaron', "Okay, I've heard enough. Time for me to finally<br/>avenge my bros...")
('Aaron', "...by opening your goddamn eyes to the truth!<br/>I'm gonna show you just how misguided you<br/>really are!")
('Alexandre', '...!')
('Alexandre', '...You have grown substantially since our<br/>first meeting. I can see it in your eyes.')
('Alexandre', 'Words no longer hold any meaning here, then.')
('Alexandre', 'Will this be my final resting place—or will it<br/>be yours? Let us find out.')
('Aaron', 'Bring it!')
('Zin the Immovable', "Our enemy is prepared to throw away his life, but I<br/>won't let that happen!")
('Rixia', 'Careful, everyone! Foes who have nothing to fear are<br/>the most dangerous enemies of all!')
('Shizuna', "This guy's basically an undead monster, right? Cool.<br/>Wanted to perform an exorcism.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'Our foe is jumping at the chance to throw<br/>everything away. I say we let him! ...After we wear<br/>him down, of course.')
('Van', "Deploying shards! This guy's a fast one, so be on<br/>your guard!")
('Aaron', "You're finished.")
('Alexandre', '*pant* So it seems.')
('Quatre', 'W-We did it!')
('Feri', 'Yes!')
('Alexandre', 'Now, strike me down.')
('Alexandre', 'That is the privilege—no, the duty of any victor<br/>in war. I will not live on in shame for a<br/>moment longer.')
('Alexandre', 'So...do it. This place...will be my tomb.')
('Van', "Sorry, but no. That's not how we roll.")
('Van', "You said earlier you aren't followin' your code of<br/>honor anymore, so we won't, either. We aren't even<br/>soldiers to begin with.")
('Feri', "The Warriors of Kruga don't believe in senseless<br/>murder, and that's exactly what this would be.")
('Aaron', 'There you have it.')
('Aaron', "I get that you have a death wish and all, but we aren't<br/>exactly the wish-granting type. You're outta<br/>luck, bud.")
('Alexandre', 'Ugh...')
('Alexandre', 'So...I have failed to meet death yet again...')
('Aaron', "Damn right you have. You aren't getting off the hook<br/>that easily—not after all you've done.")
('Aaron', "You're gonna carry the weight of your sins for the rest<br/>of your life. I'll make damn sure of that.")
('Van', "What he said. And once you're done living out your<br/>life with that weight on your back...")
('Van', "...maybe the whole 'be a prisoner no more' bit from<br/>your dad will finally sink in.")
('Alexandre', '...!')
('Alexandre', 'Heh. You people are quite strange.')
('Alexandre', 'Had I met someone like you after I left my home, my<br/>life would have taken a different course. Perhaps a<br/>better one, even.')
('Alexandre', "Nevertheless...it's too late to turn back the clock.")
('Aaron', '...?!')
('Van', 'You fool!')
('Van', 'Raaaagh!')
('Alexandre', 'Gah!')
('Van', 'Damn it...')
('Aaron', 'You...used me?')
('Alexandre', "*pant* Sorry. But there's...no going back for me now.")
('Alexandre', 'Finally... I can go to the place...I belong...')
('Judith', '...')
('Feri', '...')
('Aaron', '...')
('Quatre', '...')
('Agnès', 'Van...')
('Risette', '...')
('Van', "Don't worry about me. This isn't like what happened<br/>with Aida, and it's not like it's my first time, either.")
('Van', "In a spriggan's line of work, sometimes the situation<br/>calls for it—and I'll be damned if I let anyone else<br/>here take on that burden.")
('Aaron', 'Screw that.')
('Aaron', "This one's on me. I underestimated just how deep his<br/>despair ran, and I let my guard down.")
('Aaron', "So don't give me that 'I'm the only one who'll carry<br/>this burden' shit.")
('Van', '...')
('Feri', "He tried to force Van's hand—just so he would<br/>kill him.")
('Agnès', "I won't let you bear this alone.")
('Quatre', "I won't, either. It's too heavy a load for one person.")
('Bergard', '...')
('Aaron', "This one's on me. I underestimated just how deep his<br/>despair ran, and I let my guard down.")
('Feri', "He tried to force Van's hand—just so he would<br/>kill him.")
('Risette', 'I can only hope he has found peace at last.')
('Bergard', "We'll have to carry this sin with us. Just as with Viola.")
('Van', 'Yeah. I know.')
('Agnès', 'Van...')
('Quatre', "Remember, we promised to share your burden.<br/>You aren't alone.")
('Alexandre', 'Nguh!')
('Zin the Immovable', "Sorry, but that option isn't open to you. Not while<br/>we're here.")
('Fie', "Can't let Van do something he'd regret, either.")
('Van', 'Thanks for stepping in, you two.')
('Aaron', "Damn it. I can't believe I let my guard down. I do<br/>NOT like being used as bait.")
('Alexandre', '...!')
('Alexandre', 'Ugh...')
('Zin the Immovable', "Sorry, but that option isn't open to you. Not while<br/>we're here.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Whew... You guys all right?')
('Van', 'Yeah. Thanks for stepping in.')
('Aaron', "Damn it. I can't believe I let my guard down. I do<br/>NOT like being used as bait.")
('Alexandre', 'Grr...!')
('Rixia', 'What power...!')
('Judith', 'Rixia!')
('Cao', 'That is enough.')
('Alexandre', '...')
('Aaron', "Damn it. I can't believe I let my guard down. I do<br/>NOT like being used as bait.")
('Judith', 'Phew. That was a close one. Thanks, Ri—I<br/>mean, Yin.')
('Van', 'Yeah. Thanks to the both of you.')
('Rixia', "Of course. I'm just glad I was able to make it in time.")
('Cao', 'Heh. Aaron is practically family—and family always<br/>looks after one another.')
('Alexandre', '...?!')
('Kurogane', 'Rougetsu-style...Shadow Bind.')
('Shizuna', 'Nap time. Nighty-night!')
('Alexandre', '...')
('Aaron', "Damn it. I can't believe I let my guard down. I do<br/>NOT like being used as bait.")
('Van', 'Thanks. I seriously owe you one.')
('Shizuna', "Nah, it's no biggie. Just helping out a<br/>fellow teammate.")
('Alexandre', 'Gah!')
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Close, but no cigar. Too bad I was here to spoil<br/>your fun.')
('Aaron', "Damn it. I can't believe I let my guard down. I do<br/>NOT like being used as bait.")
('Van', "You went out on a limb to help us? What's the world<br/>coming to?")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'Oh? Do you truly believe Walter was helping you out<br/>of the goodness of his heart? How cute.')
('Walter the Direwolf', "I was just takin' the chance to put you and the kiddo<br/>in my debt.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Never know when it might come in handy, y'know?")
('Van', 'Bah. Figures.')
('Feri', "He tried to force Van's hand—just so he would<br/>kill him.")
('Bergard', "He wanted to die a soldier's death—no matter<br/>the cost. He is a warrior to the core.")
('Agnès', "So it seems. Though I'm really glad we stopped it<br/>from happening.")
('Van', 'The middle zone boss Alexandre has been defeated.<br/>Zone clear. Round two complete.')
('Melchior', "You've done it again!")
('Melchior', 'You made short work of that round. A splendid job<br/>all around, players!')
('Melchior', "Thanks to you, this game's going rather smoothly.<br/>Keep up the good work!")
('Van', 'Shut up, you bastard.')
('Judith', 'Ugh. Just hearing that grating voice makes me want<br/>to puke.')
('Melchior', "Ahaha! Aww, stop it. You're making me blush. ❤")
('Melchior', 'Tomorrow will be the last day of the game.<br/>The climax is nearly upon us!')
('Melchior', "The third and final round will begin at 7AM. Try not<br/>to sleep in. You wouldn't want to miss it for<br/>the world.")
('Melchior', 'Who will win? Who will lose? Will one of the eight<br/>teams make it to the boss in time—or will you go the<br/>way of the Creil villagers?')
('Melchior', "Well, we'll find out soon. Au revoir!")
('Risette', 'Tomorrow will no doubt be taxing on all of us.')
('Bergard', 'We will have to traverse both the lower floors and the<br/>remnants of the palace—the latter of which is where<br/>their leader lies in wait.')
('Quatre', "It's a lot for sure, but I think we can manage.")
('Feri', "We've come this far! Nothing can stop us now!")
('System', 'With Alexandre defeated, their journey through the<br/>middle zone was now at an end.')
('System', 'They returned to the surface, carrying his remains<br/>with them.')
('System', "But they were then left with a pressing conundrum:<br/>'Who should take custody of him?'")
('Van', "(He might be unconscious right now, but he's still an<br/>Almata exec. Someone needs to keep a watchful eye<br/>on him till this is over.)")
('Van', "(And that someone can't be us. Can't afford to split<br/>my team. I should hand him over to a group with<br/>more manpower...but who?)")
('Van', "(Guess I'll let the guild handle it this time.)")
('Van', "(Guess I'll let Heiyue handle it this time.)")
('Van', '...Mind if we leave him with you guys?')
('Fie', "Sure thing. We'll take him into our custody.")
('Zin the Immovable', "We're kinda short on manpower at the moment, but<br/>I'm sure we can count on the CID for a bit<br/>of support.")
('Van', 'Cool.')
('Van', "I think handin' him over to the guild is our best bet,<br/>even if they're short-staffed.")
('Van', "I'll give Elaine a call.")
('Agnès', "Don't forget that Renne's there, too. She can help out<br/>if need be.")
('Cao', 'What a shame. And here I was, ready to pounce at<br/>the opportunity to interrogate him. Might<br/>you reconsider?')
('Van', "Yeah, no. If we left him in your hands, there's no<br/>tellin' what'd happen to him.")
('Rixia', "It's thanks to their efforts that we won at all. I don't<br/>think you have room to object here.")
('Cao', '*sigh* Indeed. Truly a pity.')
('Van', '...Mind if we leave him with you guys?')
('Cao', 'Well, this is a surprise.')
('Van', "Normally I'd have given him over to the guild, but we<br/>know they're a bit short-staffed right now.")
('Van', "Probably would be hard to work with the local cops,<br/>too, so I think this is the best option we've got.")
('Van', "First things first, though. Promise me you'll hand him<br/>over to the capital police when this is all over, or I'll<br/>find someone else.")
('Cao', 'Very well. I will do my best to adhere to that promise.')
('Cao', 'Depending on what we learn from him, however, it<br/>may not be easy to convince the powers that be to<br/>release him from our custody.')
('Aaron', 'Those damn elders...')
('Rixia', 'But I will do everything within my power to ensure<br/>he is brought to the authorities when we are done.<br/>You have my word.')
('Judith', "That's reassuring to hear, at least.")
('Fie', "...So you don't trust us with him, then.")
('Van', "What? No. I'm doing this 'cause I know you guys are<br/>stretched thin.")
('Van', "Probably would be hard to work with the local cops,<br/>too, so I think this is the best option we've got.")
('Fie', '*sigh* The truth hurts.')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Hate to admit it, but we do have a lot on our plate as<br/>it is.')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Could you do us a solid and arrange for them to hand<br/>him over to the capital police when all of this is over?')
('Van', "That's the plan.")
('Van', "I think handin' him over to the guild is our best bet,<br/>even if they're short-staffed.")
('Van', "I'll give Elaine a call.")
('Agnès', "Don't forget that Renne's there, too. She can help out<br/>if need be.")
('Aaron', "You, uh, sure that's a good idea?")
('Van', "I'm not keen on the idea, either, but the guild's<br/>stretched thin right now.")
('Van', "Probably would be hard to work with the local cops,<br/>too, so I think this is the best option we've got.")
('Van', "I'm plannin' to ask them to hand him over to the<br/>capital police when this is all over, though.")
('Agnès', "It's hard to feel at ease when Heiyue is involved...but<br/>there aren't many other viable alternatives.")
('Judith', "At least Ri—I mean, Yin is with them. She'll stop<br/>them from going too far. Of that I'm certain.")
('Shizuna', '*sigh* And after going through all the trouble of<br/>beating him up...')
('Shizuna', "I'd love to take custody of him, but I'll let this one go.")
('Kurogane', 'We cannot seize custody by force. Doing so would be<br/>violating the samurai code of honor.')
('Van', "Sweet. Thanks for bein' so chill about it.<br/>(Ah. So their client must be...)")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "So you're sparing the wolf who has bared his teeth at<br/>you and your flock? How foolish.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'Perhaps we ought to save you from yourselves.<br/>I hereby offer to send him to sleep with the fishes.')
('Agnès', '...')
('Van', 'Offer rejected. Keep your filthy paws to yourselves,<br/>both of you.')
('Walter the Direwolf', "Why, though? He's lost the will to go on, so he's as<br/>good as dead, if you ask me.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "You've gone soft, Arkride. Hope that doesn't come<br/>back to bite you one day.")
('Van', 'Yeah, yeah. Whatever.')
(500, 'Not long after...')
(40451, 'That concludes our report.')
(40451, "As for Alexandre, he was delivered into the<br/>guild's custody.")
(40451, "As for Alexandre, he appears to have been delivered<br/>into Heiyue's custody.")
('Ashladd', "That's one less problem to contend with.")
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', 'I am afraid we cannot compromise on our mission.<br/>You should focus on your primary task as well.')
('Ashladd', 'That outcome does not change any of our<br/>plans, however. How fare the arrangements for the<br/>other target?')
(40451, 'They are complete, sir.')
(40452, 'We have given our report to the captain and<br/>secured permission to execute the target.')
(40453, 'Are you certain you will not require our aid, sir?')
('Ashladd', 'I would prefer to operate independently while on<br/>the surface. You can gather intelligence in<br/>the meantime.')
('Ashladd', 'Let the preparations for the heretic hunt begin.')
(40451, 'Yes, sir!')
(500, 'November 22nd, 1208, 7:00AM')
('System', 'Keycard confirmed.')
('System', 'Team Arkride Solutions can now enter the<br/>lower zone.')
('System', 'A fearsome foe is prowling around.')
('System', 'Found <br/>.')
('System', 'Found <br/>.')
('System', 'Quest Middle Zone Extermination completed!')
('System', 'Received')
('System', 'The door is tightly locked.')
('Agnès', "The second round doesn't start until tomorrow<br/>morning, right?")
('Van', "Yeah. So let's get our prep work done today.")
