(40301, 'S-Stay away! STAY AWAY!')
('Risette', 'Oh, my.')
('Bergard', 'This is not good! That man is being attacked!')
('Feri', "Let's help him!")
(40301, 'Am I...going to die here...?')
('Van', 'Not if I can help it!')
(40301, 'Who are you people?!')
('Judith', "We'll talk later. Stay back!")
(40301, 'O-Okay!')
('Risette', 'Commencing counteroffensive!')
('Agnès', 'Are you hurt at all?')
(40301, "No, I'm okay...")
(40301, "Wait. No, I'm not! Please, help me!")
('Feri', 'Huh? But all the enemies are dead.')
('Quatre', "Hold on a moment. Weren't there two tourists we<br/>needed to save?")
(40301, "My girlfriend's in danger! She's deeper in!")
(40301, "Are you guys bracers? No, that doesn't matter!<br/>Whoever you are...just please save her!")
('Aaron', "Don't tell me you abandoned her to save your<br/>own hide.")
(40301, 'Of course not! I was trying to save her!')
(40301, 'We were just wandering around and minding our<br/>own business, and those things came from out of<br/>nowhere and attacked us!')
(40301, 'They had us cornered, so I used myself as bait to lure<br/>them away from her!')
('Judith', "Wow. You've got some serious backbone.")
('Van', "All right. You head on back up to the surface and<br/>wait for us. We'll rescue your girl.")
(40301, 'Y-You mean it?')
('Bergard', "Of course. We'll take care of her.")
(40301, "Th-Then I'll leave it to you! You're my only hope, so<br/>please rescue her!")
('Agnès', "Now, let's go find her. I wouldn't be surprised if she<br/>was at the end.")
('Risette', 'Bear in mind that the layout is identical to the other<br/>entrances, so both the left and right paths will take<br/>the same amount of time to traverse.')
('Van', "I'm not sensing any monsters nearby, so we should be<br/>able to make a sprint for it.")
('Quatre', 'There she is!')
('Aaron', 'Looks like these guys just did the saving for us.')
('Aaron', "They must be one of the teams in the game—and I'm<br/>guessing this is their turf.")
('Feri', "Careful. These guys are jaegers for sure. I've never<br/>seen them here in the Republic before, but I doubt<br/>they're good news.")
('Van', "Got it. So if they aren't Nidhoggr, they must be...")
('Van', 'Hey. You guys are the Scorpions of Zahat, right?')
(40451, "I take it you're one of the other participating teams?")
('Van', 'Yeah. Arkride Solutions.')
(40452, "Wait... That's the name of the team that thrashed the<br/>head honcho of round one!")
(40451, 'We may have been eliminated, but this is still our<br/>base of operations.')
(40451, 'What business do you have here?')
('Van', "Nothing with you, but we do have business with the<br/>woman that's sprawled out on the floor.")
('Quatre', "Don't tell me she's—")
('Risette', 'No, she is simply unconscious.')
(40451, 'And what do you want with her?')
('Van', "We're here to get her out of here. Mind handin'<br/>her over?")
(40451, "I should've figured that's what you wanted.")
(40451, 'Unfortunately, our answer is no.')
('Agnès', 'B-But why?!')
(40451, 'Because she saw our faces.')
('Quatre', 'What?')
(40451, 'We cannot allow civilians to bear witness to that.')
(40451, "That's why we have no choice but to make<br/>her disappear.")
('Bergard', "So you're merely covering your tracks.")
('Agnès', 'But why go that far...?')
('Feri', "You're planning to kill her just because she saw<br/>your faces? That's messed up—and we're NOT gonna<br/>let that happen!")
(40451, "Hmm? You look like you're a jaeger—and quite a<br/>young one, at that.")
(40451, 'In that case, let me educate you on something you<br/>should already understand:')
(40451, "Every corps has their own rules that they must<br/>abide by. That's what it means to be a jaeger.")
(40451, 'If you cannot come to terms with that, then in my<br/>eyes, you are nothing more than an immature<br/>little girl.')
('Feri', 'Ngh...!')
('Van', 'Shut the hell up, assholes.')
('Van', "She might be a jaeger, but right now, she's an<br/>assistant at my office.")
('Van', "And I'm not gonna let you diss one of my employees<br/>like that.")
('Feri', 'Van...')
('Van', "We're gonna play this thing by my rules. Here's how<br/>this is gonna go down...")
('Van', 'Lemme level with you. Killing her is just about the<br/>dumbest thing you could do in this situation.')
(40451, "Oh? And why's that?")
('Van', "It's possible that taking this girl's life could wind up<br/>leading to a rule violation.")
('Van', "I don't know about you, but some of us aren't ready to<br/>be called home to be with the Goddess.")
(40451, 'Last I checked, the rules do not forbid the act of<br/>killing civilians—just leaking information to them.')
('Van', 'True, but consider this:')
('Van', 'What if someone reports that girl as missing?')
('Van', 'It might arouse the curiosity of a journalist in search<br/>of a story or a police officer with a burning sense<br/>of justice.')
('Van', "They could end up blowin' this whole thing wide<br/>open—and also blow us up in the process.")
('Van', "I'd say it's best to play it safe and let her go.")
(40451, "I think you're reaching.")
('Van', "Oh, and there's another thing you ought to<br/>worry about.")
('Van', "If you harm a hair on that girl's head, you're gonna<br/>have a giant target painted on your backs.")
('Van', "In case you didn't know, the Bracer Guild's in the<br/>business of protecting civilians.")
('Van', "And we might just have to tip 'em off if you don't<br/>hand her over to us.")
(40451, 'Are you threatening us?!')
('Van', 'Course not.')
('Van', "But we are guild subcontractors, so we're obligated to<br/>report to 'em if something happens to her.")
('Van', "It's like you said earlier. You've got your rules you<br/>have to follow, and we've got ours, too.")
('Aaron', '(Heh. Way to throw their words back in their<br/>stupid faces.)')
('Judith', "(Look at him—whipping out the subcontractor bit<br/>only when it's convenient.)")
('Van', "If you ask me, you guys are puttin' your head in the<br/>lion's mouth.")
(40451, '...')
('Van', "I'm a nice guy, though, so I promise I won't snitch on<br/>you—if you give her over to us unharmed.")
('Van', "I can just report that she was found by a bunch of<br/>meatheads who were playin' airsoft. They'd probably<br/>buy that.")
('Van', "And I doubt she'd blab 'cause this place is supposed<br/>to be off limits.")
('Van', "Plan's foolproof—and everyone wins. We get the girl,<br/>and you get outta this unscathed.")
(40451, 'Very well.')
(40451, "I don't see any reason to turn down your offer.")
('Van', "Great. Sounds like we've got a deal.")
('Van', "Now, then. We'll just take her with us and be on<br/>our way.")
('Van', "We're gonna fight it out.")
(40303, "...You're challenging us?")
('Van', 'Yeah. If we win, you hand her over to us.')
('Van', "If you win, we'll back down.")
('Van', "And of course, we won't say a word about this<br/>to anyone.")
(40303, "This doesn't benefit us in the slightest.")
('Van', "Sure it does. It'll help kill the time.")
('Van', "It's not like you have anything else better to<br/>do, anyway. After all, you DID get eliminated from<br/>the get-go.")
(40304, 'You bastard! How dare you mock us!')
('Judith', '(They took the bait.)')
('Agnès', '(He really knows how to rile people up...)')
(40304, "We just got unlucky! If you went up against Marduk<br/>right from the start, you would've lost, too!")
(40304, "We would've kicked your asses if we ran into<br/>you instead!")
('Van', "Them's fightin' words. Wanna prove it?")
(40303, '...Fine. Your funeral, punk.')
(40303, "We'll return home with your head on a pike!")
('Van', "Yeah, don't think so.")
('Aaron', 'Bring it on, losers!')
('Feri', 'Commencing battle with the Scorpions of Zahat!')
(40451, "Urgh... Maybe we...didn't really stand a chance in<br/>this game...")
(40451, "We should've brought more firepower!")
('Van', "I feel for you guys. Goin' up against Marduk right at<br/>the start must've been tough.")
('Van', "This ain't your home turf, either. You guys got the<br/>raw end of the deal.")
(40451, 'In any event, you won fair and square. The girl<br/>is yours.')
('Van', 'Cool.')
('Van', "We'll come up with a story to cover you guys.")
(40451, '...Thank you.')
