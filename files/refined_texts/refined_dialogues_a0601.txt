('System', "Still, you don't hear about monsters attacking buses<br/>very often lately.")
('System', "It's at times like this that I wish there was a bracer in<br/>the village...")
('System', 'That famous A-ranker came by some time ago. I was<br/>on duty at the time, but I was still blown away by<br/>her swordsmanship.')
('System', "Putting the bus accident aside, I'm just glad nobody<br/>was hurt.")
('System', "I'd better issue a report about those monsters, too.")
('System', "This village has a lovely peaceful atmosphere, so I'm<br/>glad that the monsters didn't cause any casualties.")
('System', 'Sorry, but I gotta focus on repairing this bus<br/>right now.')
('System', 'If you need anything, just talk to my apprentice in the<br/>workshop at the back.')
('System', 'She might not be fully qualified, but she can modify<br/>orbments no problem.')
('System', "Just give her the chance to hone her skills, won't you?")
('System', "If you're looking for my workshop, it's at the back of<br/>the church.")
('System', 'My apprentice should be there keeping an eye on the<br/>store, so talk to her if you need anything.')
('System', "Who would have thought we'd get attacked by<br/>monsters while the engine had broken down?<br/>There was something weird about them, too.<br/>Can't deny I was scared.")
('System', "It's fortunate that none of my passengers were hurt,<br/>but does this still count as putting them in danger...?")
('System', 'It was inevitable, right? I won’t be held responsible,<br/>will I?')
('System', "Still, I can't help but feel bad about the delay...")
('System', "I was petrified about the complaints I'd get, but it<br/>seems like the repair work is in good hands.<br/>That takes a little bit of the stress off.")
('System', "Who would have thought I'd get held up in an<br/>accident on my long-awaited trip to Remiferia?")
('System', 'Oh well. Doing some sightseeing in this village<br/>should lift my spirits.')
('System', "There's always something interesting discover, no<br/>matter where you go. That's why I can never give<br/>up traveling.")
('System', "If I hadn't gotten stuck in this village, I might not<br/>have discovered this hidden gem. iIf you look it at<br/>that way, I actually got lucky.")
('System', 'I travel practically every month anyway.')
('System', 'Last month, I went to Crossbell. Their theme park is<br/>worth a visit, let me tell you that.')
('System', 'Ah! N-no, this isn’t, I’m not...')
('System', 'N-no... nothing, never mind. D-don’t bother yourself<br/>with me... please?')
('Van', '(Huh? Was he looking at me?)')
('Agnès', '(He seems to be afraid... Is he an acquaintance<br/>of yours?')
('Van', '(Nope, no idea who he is.)')
('Van', '(Well, something’s up with him but we’ve got<br/>other priorities.)')
('Van', '(Let’s just leave him be for now.)')
('System', 'T-They’ve already come all the way out here....? No.<br/>No, it can’t be... but he’s clearly not your<br/>average person...')
('Van', "(You wouldn't be that scared if you had nothing<br/>to hide...)")
('Van', '(Best to keep an eye on him, I suppose.)')
('System', "As for myself, I'm a fisherman from the Republic's<br/>branch of the Fisherman's Guild.")
('System', 'I arrived here yesterday to assess the water quality and<br/>develop some new fishing spots, but...')
('System', "I came back from fishing to find there'd been some<br/>sort of incident.")
('System', "It's probably best to stay inside for now.")
('System', "I got a bike last year, and I have to admit, it's made<br/>my work in the outskirts so much easier.")
('System', "Riding it is fun in itself. It's almost as popular as<br/>fishing now.")
('System', 'I feel like our bikes even influence which fishing spots<br/>we choose nowadays.')
('System', "Hey, did you see that cute green-haired guy on<br/>the bus? You don't find cool people like that<br/>around here.")
('System', 'I bet you see cool people like that in the city all the<br/>time, don’t you? Ugh, now I’m even more desperate<br/>to save up and move away!')
('System', 'If he was on the bus, then maybe he stopped by<br/>the inn.')
('System', "Maybe he's talking to Ran. I'd better ask where he<br/>went later.")
('System', 'Welcome to the Creil Church... Oh, is<br/>something amiss?')
('Feri', 'No... Pardon me, are you of<br/>Central-Eastern heritage?')
('Feri', 'It’s a little surprising to see you working in a church<br/>around here.')
('System', 'Ah, tourists sometimes find it a bit surprising as well.')
('System', 'I might not look like it, but I was actually born and<br/>raised in this village.')
('System', 'After I’d finished my training and returned from the Holy City,<br/>I was approached to serve in some of the Central-Eastern temples, but...')
('System', 'I was already set on the idea of becoming a sister<br/>for the village I was born in.')
('Van', 'Wow, talk about being loyal to your roots.')
('Van', "Now that ya mention it, I remember hearin' that lot<br/>of old immigrant families made this place their home<br/>back in the day.")
('System', "That's right. Everyone in this village is like family.")
('System', 'As fellows in this village, other differences are fairly<br/>minor in comparison.')
('Feri', 'I see... So this village is like one big family, too.')
('Feri', "This place is pretty different from my home back in<br/>Kruga, but we sure have that in common. It's no<br/>wonder I feel such an affinity to this place.")
('System', "A lot of people advised me to go to a chapel or<br/>temple in a bigger town, but I've never regretted<br/>my decision.")
('System', "I get to watch over my father, my brother, and all the<br/>other villagers who've taken care of me from here.")
('System', "I work as a hunter around 'ere.")
('System', 'I’m just on my way back from a hunt... and I heard a<br/>bus was attacked by monsters or something?')
('System', "As a hunter, keeping monsters away is<br/>my responsibility. I'll have to search the area later.")
('System', "I might not have seen them with my own eyes, but<br/>from what I've heard, those monsters were acting<br/>pretty strange. That's cause for concern.")
('System', "Hopefully it's just my imagination, but I have a bad<br/>feeling about this... Even the beasts look sort<br/>of frightened.")
('System', 'Whine... Grrr...')
('System', 'As you can see, our pup sees himself as something of<br/>a guard dog as well.')
('System', 'Rrrrr... Woof!')
('System', 'We’re an Eastern family, but apparently one of my<br/>ancestors was a pretty well-respected<br/>Eastern-style blacksmith.')
('System', "It was that person's notes that inspired my daughter<br/>to go down the craftsman route. She's now training to<br/>become a technician over at the workshop.")
('System', "I'd hate to stop her from pursuing her dreams, but I<br/>don’t really think there’s any connection between the<br/>kinds of professionals who work in modern<br/>workshops and old blacksmiths, myself...")
('System', 'Incidentally, I’ve never been good at machines or<br/>smithing or any of that.')
('System', 'Well, people say I’m a pro when it comes to fixing<br/>farming machinery...but I think they give me too<br/>much credit.')
('System', 'Did you enjoy our village’s famous galettes?')
('System', 'It seems people are almost shockingly unaware<br/>galettes are made with Eastern buckwheat flour, but...')
('System', 'From what I hear, it was my family’s ancestors that<br/>brought buckwheat flour here.')
('System', 'My husband and I manage the buckwheat milling.')
('System', 'Honestly, all that stuff about my ancestors is just<br/>something stuck in my head. I just like my job<br/>because I’m proud to help with something the village<br/>is known for.')
('System', 'Oh, welcome to our village! We were just getting the<br/>fertilizer ready!')
('System', 'These days, all everybody talks about is galettes--but<br/>trust me, my pumpkins will put them to shame!')
('System', "I'm going to display my fantastic pumpkins in the<br/>harvest festival. They don't just look good, but they<br/>taste great too!")
('System', "Actually, my son and daughter are playing over by<br/>the river. Not that you'll notice much<br/>family resemblance!")
('System', "It's great that my son has so much energy, but my<br/>daughter is a little too shy for my liking!")
('System', "It'd put her old man's mind at ease if she were a little<br/>more ballsy.")
('System', 'Ah, hello. Are you travelers? You don’t seem to be<br/>people who were on the bus.')
('System', 'I can’t recommend any exciting points, but our village<br/>is a relaxing, peaceful place. I hope you’ll be able to<br/>take it easy while you’re here.')
('System', 'Oh, you should try some of the vegetables Martha<br/>sells herself! They’re all so good, they’re a secret little<br/>specialty of our village.')
('System', 'She carries the pumpkins we grow, too.')
('System', 'Galettes are, of course, what we’re known best for.<br/>Still, we’ve got plenty of crops here that are nothing<br/>but amazing.')
('System', 'My husband’s a slob, but even so, he can grow a<br/>pumpkin that’s far better than you’ll find in your<br/>average shop.')
('System', "Kent! I know you're pleased to have found a crab, but<br/>calm down a little, won't you?")
('System', "I don't want to slipping and hitting yourself against<br/>a rock... Ugh, just the thought of it sends a chill down<br/>my spine...")
('System', "I do envy my little brother's energy and curosity from<br/>time to time, but...")
('System', 'The other week, he got these really scary-looking<br/>people to play with him... That was a worrying<br/>reminder of how fearless he really is.')
('System', 'No way! There really was a freshwater crab here.')
('System', 'It was hiding in the exact spot the fisherman told me<br/>it would be!')
('System', 'I see killifish ALL the time, but it turns out that all<br/>these creatures were hiding under the rocks all along!')
('System', 'That fishing guy sure knows his stuff!')
('System', 'The other day, I got a whole bunch of jaegers to come<br/>and play with me!')
('System', 'I thought my dad was strong until I met them.<br/>They even picked me up so I could pretend I was an<br/>airplane flying through the sky!')
('System', 'Hey there, travelers. Curious about the windmill?')
('System', 'This thing’s my partner. We use it to thresh wheat.')
('System', 'I mean, fresh veggies and buckwheat galettes are<br/>good and all, but bread’s your mainstay, right?')
('System', 'In a sense, we fill the stomach of the whole<br/>Republic here.')
('System', 'Common farmers like us are proud to grow any crop,<br/>but wheat just has a different feel to it.')
('System', "A golden wheat field, glistening all over... It's so<br/>exciting to think that something so dynamic will one<br/>day be made into bread.")
('System', 'Besides... You can’t make a beer without the<br/>right grains!')
('System', 'Mister, you were talking about taking jobs from the<br/>people of the village. Are you a bracer?')
('System', 'Actually, I wanna be a bracer, too...')
('Van', 'Sorry to disappoint, but I’m no bracer.')
('Van', "And I'm not the kind of guy you'd want as a role<br/>model, either.")
('System', "Really? Well, now that you mention it, you don't give<br/>off that vibe.")
('System', 'Hmm, guess I jumped to conclusions.')
('System', 'Man though... Annie’s such a grownup.')
('System', 'The way she’s always watching out for that little brat<br/>of a brother she’s got, you know?')
('System', 'Folks say she seems kinda weak-willed, but I don’t<br/>think she could take such good care of him if she<br/>wasn’t strong where it counts.')
('System', '...I’ve gotta get stronger, too.')
('System', 'Welcome. Are you looking to buy something?')
('System', 'People love our vegetables even in the city, but I<br/>assure you, the veggies you’ll get here, freshly<br/>harvested with the scent of earth still on them, are<br/>the best.')
('System', 'I sell our produce direct from the farmers here, so<br/>your business would be welcome.')
('System', "By the way, vegetables aren't all I stock. I have a few<br/>little trinkets on sale, too.")
('System', 'I do handicrafts in my spare time, you see.<br/>These accessories were all made by yours truly.')
('System', 'Hmm... I wasn’t expecting to get to the point where I<br/>can’t read my own ledger.')
('System', 'I’ve grown old. Sad as it is to say.')
('System', 'I’m simply glad I have such a capable grandson...')
('System', "Come to think of it, haven't we met<br/>somewhere before?")
('System', "You haven't visited my shop before, by any chance,<br/>have you?")
('Van', 'Sorry, but this is actually my first visit.')
('System', 'Hmm, it does feel like we’ve met before, though...')
('System', 'It takes him such a long time to remember his<br/>customers nowadays. All I can do is apologize...')
('System', 'Sorry you had to see that.')
('System', 'My granddad’s been getting a lot worse since my<br/>parents died in a traffic accident.')
('System', "I wish I could keep a closer eye on him, but the<br/>deliveries are my responsibility now my parents<br/>aren't around...")
('System', 'Thanks for your business. Did you like the galettes?')
('System', "We serve different food in the evenings, but I assure<br/>you it's just as good. If you're staying the night, you<br/>should join us for dinner as well!")
('System', "I know there was some kind of accident, but there's<br/>no need to be overly nervous.")
('System', "My hospitality's going to make everyone glad they got<br/>held up!")
('System', 'Come to think of it, my daughter’s been baking our<br/>famous galettes almost more than I have lately.')
('System', 'She’s probably gonna be a better cook than I<br/>am, soon. I’m excited to see just how good she’ll get.')
('System', "Those sorts of people actually stop by our village<br/>pretty often. Even I've got used to them by now.")
('System', 'In fact, I got along well with that leader lady who was<br/>with those folks from the other day.')
('System', 'On that note, do you need any orbments modifying?<br/>We might be out in the sticks here, but we do have a<br/>proper workshop.')
('System', "My boss is repairing the bus right now, but I can<br/>vouch for my friend who's tending the store. You'll be<br/>in safe hands.")
('System', 'I’ve got some business regarding health suppliments<br/>over in Remiferia.')
('System', 'I was worried the delay might be a problem, but I was<br/>able to contact the people I had an appointment with<br/>via the inn’s phone, and they were<br/>very understanding.')
('System', "Now I'm under even more pressure to clinch the deal.")
('System', 'I get the impression that lots of the older villagers are<br/>involved in manual labor, since this is a<br/>farming village...')
('System', "Hmm, that supplement market could be promising.<br/>I should take a little look around so my time here<br/>doesn't go to waste.")
('Van', "I take it you're the trainee blacksmith. Lemme see<br/>what you've got on sale.")
('System', "Ooh, someone's been doing their research.")
('System', "You say ＂trainee,＂ but I'm actually self-taught.<br/>If you're okay with the stuff I've made to practice, you<br/>can take them off my hands for free...")
('Van', "Bah, that doesn't bother me. I'm happy to pay a<br/>proper price.")
('System', 'Items have been added to Goddard Workshop!')
('System', 'I was planning on fixing the bus myself, but I had to<br/>let my boss take care of it.')
('System', "Hmph. I guess they're still treating me like<br/>an amateur.")
('System', "I've already mastered modifications. Isn't it about<br/>time I moved onto the next stage?")
('System', "Oh, a customer? If there's anything you need, I'll<br/>gladly be of service.")
('System', 'There’s been more travelers from the city lately, so<br/>I’ve been spending more time helping them lately.')
('System', "We might be an old-fashioned rural village, but we've<br/>started distributing more and more of our vegetables<br/>and grains to urban areas.")
('System', 'Well, this village is full of good people, so feel free to<br/>take your time.')
('System', "I've heard about the bus accident.")
('System', "The city's becoming an indispensable market for us,<br/>but even so...")
('System', "This incident makes me worry about the people in<br/>our village who work in transport. I'd better have a<br/>chat with them, just to be on the safe side.")
('System', 'Welcome. Are you guys from the capital, too?')
('System', "As I'm sure you've noticed, this is a humble little<br/>village, but more people have been making the effort<br/>to visit us for sightseeing.")
('System', "Since we've started exporting more of our crops to the<br/>city, word's gotten around about how lovely our<br/>village is.")
('System', "My husband's been expanding our crop market to<br/>include urban areas, but..")
('System', "He's not once neglected our traditions or the<br/>thoughts of our people.")
('System', 'That balanced mentality must have been why he was<br/>put forward to become mayor.')
('System', 'Well now, you’re an unfamiliar face. Are you<br/>a traveler? Welcome to our church.')
('System', 'As I’m sure you’ve noticed, it’s a peaceful spot.<br/>It’s had its fare share of visitors as of late.')
('System', 'Not many people know this, but there are actually<br/>some ancient ruins nearby.')
('System', "It's a relic from some animistic faith. I suppose the<br/>people around here have always had a deep<br/>appreciation for nature, even in ancient times.")
('System', 'Actually, some time ago, they even dug up a big stone<br/>statue from the remains.')
('System', 'I was there when it was recovered, and I must say, it<br/>was a truly magnificent thing.')
('System', 'Oh, Van...')
('System', "Ahaha, what a coincidence! I wasn't expecting to run<br/>into an old childhood friend around here...")
('System', 'Hey there! Got your eye on anything?')
('System', "Teehee, Agnès! How long has it been since I've<br/>seen you?!")
('System', "...Oh my, a traveler? I do hope you're looking forward<br/>to this year's harvest festival! ♪")
('System', "Ugh, what a crowd... I hope they don't sell out...")
('System', "Our kid's really been looking forward to the bazaar.")
('System', 'Phew, we’re finally here... That was some journey.')
('System', "What was that? ＂That guy has really defined<br/>facial features＂?! ...That's none of your business!!")
('System', 'Hurry up, Mom!!')
('System', 'Coming! If you want to place an order, head to<br/>the counter!')
('System', "...Who's this old geezer?")
('System', "We're actually here on a family vacation. Haha, looks<br/>like they're both enjoying themselves.")
('System', "Heehee, it's busier than I thought! ♪ Let's leave our<br/>luggage behind and head straight out there!")
('System', '(Hmm... I wonder what the girls beside me are<br/>talking about...)')
('System', "(He's always been so persistent... What am I<br/>supposed to do?)")
('System', 'I want to propose to you!!')
('System', 'Mom and Dad come to pray every single day!')
('System', "They're super into it.")
('System', "Ugh, those kids... I won't be able to move an inch at<br/>this rate.")
('System', 'Oh well, what can you do?')
('System', 'My friends from the capital have come to visit!<br/>Time to bring out my best tour guide skills!')
('System', 'Do you want something to eat?')
('System', "Oh, you found me. I'm currently loaidng my<br/>face data. It'll be programmable eventually, so no<br/>need to worry.")
('System', 'W-Wait, you found me?! If you want to know more,<br/>just ask Feri.')
