('Feri', "I don't think anyone drives as good as you, Risette.")
('Feri', 'You know just how to make those little, subtle moves<br/>to work with the flow of traffic.')
('Van', 'Yeah. Never seen anyone drive so straight.')
('Risette', 'Heehee. Why, thank you very much.')
('Aaron', "Of COURSE you've got an international license.<br/>What did I expect?")
('Aaron', "I know I'm a perfect five on the driving scale, but I<br/>don't mind leaving the work to a solid three like you.<br/>Better you than the two over here.")
('Van', "Yeah, she's pretty damn... Wait, am I the two?!")
('Aaron', "That's right, chief. Better get your act together.")
('Aaron', "Don't you worry, though. You ever really wanna make<br/>her scream, I'm here.")
('Van', "You rat bastard... Don't think you can satisfy my girl<br/>with how rough you handle—")
('Risette', 'Mr. Wei, Mr. Arkride. A child is present.')
('Feri', '...?')
('Feri', '(I wonder what Agnès is up to...)')
('Renne', 'Your great-grandfather left that behind, yes?')
('Renne', 'It must be very precious to you if you even brought it<br/>for our visitation.')
('Agnès', 'It is, yes.')
('Agnès', "It's no exaggeration to say that I am who I am<br/>because of this.")
('Agnès', "Though recently, it's given me an awful lot to<br/>think about...")
('Renne', "Well, there's nothing wrong with that.")
('Renne', "It doesn't seem to me like you have any regrets<br/>about it, at least.")
('Agnès', "You're right. I don't.")
('Agnès', 'Someone told me that I make the calls on what I<br/>want to do with my life.')
('Agnès', "Maybe I haven't made all the right ones, but even<br/>still, my world has truly broadened, and I've gotten to<br/>know so many wonderful people.")
('Agnès', "I've come to know the nation of my birth from angles<br/>I never thought possible.")
('Agnès', "And thanks to that, I'm now beginning to see how I<br/>should face the man moving this country forward.")
('Renne', '...Not even trying to hide it, are you?')
('Renne', "Wasn't it supposed to be a secret to everyone but<br/>these two?")
('Agnès', 'Ahaha... True. It was.')
('Agnès', "But I don't know—I get the feeling it's fine if you<br/>know, too.")
('Agnès', "Ever since meeting you in April, you've been so kind<br/>to me.")
('Agnès', "You're the one who connected me to Van, so—")
('Agnès', "Oh, I see now... You pushed me to use the orbal net<br/>specifically so I'd find his office, didn't you?")
('Renne', 'Heehee. Bingo.')
('Renne', "If it matters, we hadn't seen each other since we first<br/>met for a request five years ago.")
('Renne', "He wasn't even aware that I had come to Calvard as a<br/>foreign exchange student.")
('Agnès', "It doesn't matter, of course...but then why did you<br/>take his arm like that...?")
('Renne', 'To see your reaction. ❤')
('Agnès', "I-I can't believe you...")
('Agnès', 'But really, I like hearing how you got to know him.')
('Agnès', 'He must have been so kind to you back then, huh?')
('Renne', 'How did you know?')
('Agnès', 'Well, because you introduced me to him.')
('Agnès', "You're always looking out for us, Renne.")
('Agnès', "So I know you would never steer any of us in the<br/>direction of someone you didn't truly trust.")
('Renne', 'Well...okay. You got me there.')
('Renne', 'He was very kind, yeah—the one who gave me the<br/>push to go from being Kitty to who I am today.')
('Renne', "He had just started out as a spriggan, and he wasn't<br/>the most sensitive or competent...")
('Renne', '...but he stayed with me, struggled with me, and<br/>showed me a path to the people I love most in<br/>this world.')
('Agnès', 'Wow. I had no idea...')
('Agnès', "Heehee. I guess Van's always been Van.")
('Agnès', 'So after you met him, you were able to reunite with<br/>your loved ones?')
('Renne', "That's right. And they're why I'm here now.")
('Renne', "They're the ones who encouraged me to study abroad,<br/>so it's thanks to them that I was able to meet all<br/>of you.")
('Renne', 'And through some twist of fate, I accepted the<br/>position of Student Council president and am now<br/>heading up this little trip.')
('Renne', 'You really never know where fate will take you.')
('Agnès', 'Tell me about it.')
('Renne', 'Does he still obsess over sweets, by the way?')
('Renne', 'I also remember him going on and on about cars...')
('Agnès', "Oh, boy... If anything, he's an even bigger fiend about<br/>them than he was before.")
('Agnès', 'At least, according to someone who knows him much<br/>better than I do, he is.')
('Renne', 'Ah, the resident A-rank. Seems like they have quite<br/>the sordid relationship.')
('Renne', 'Just what exactly IS going on between them?<br/>Heehee... I know you have GOT to be curious.')
('Agnès', 'N-Not at all... Though I, umm, might have a<br/>small idea...')
('Odette', "(Crap... It'd be weird if we woke up now. Plus I<br/>wanna hear more of what Renne has to say...)")
('Odette', '(Kinda seems like Agnès needs a little boost from us,<br/>so we better do what we can to be there for her!)')
('Albert', '(Hmph. I still refuse to acknowledge that guy and his<br/>operation as legitimate.)')
('Albert', "(...But since we're going to the same place, I'm happy<br/>to keep an eye on her as her friend.)")
('Van', 'Our next stop is...Basel, Province de Auge...the<br/>terminus of this express line.')
('Van', 'Please ensure you have all your belongings with<br/>you when disembarking the train.')
('Agnès', 'Oh...')
('Renne', 'Heehee. Finally.')
('Van', "We're gettin' close.")
('Aaron', 'Nice.')
('Risette', "That's the exit right there.")
('Van', "Well? She's a comfy ride, right?")
('Quatre', "Er... It is comfortable, yes, but I don't think now is<br/>the time to be discussing that.")
('Quatre', "Just hurry, please! We have to make sure that<br/>classified information doesn't fall into the<br/>wrong hands!")
('Van', 'Hmph. Yeah, yeah...')
('Feri', "Oh! I think that's the car!")
('Van', "Looks like she's about to stop.")
('Van', "I'm gonna pull over, too, so get ready.")
