('Risette', 'Are you on patrol tonight?')
('Van', "Yeah. Night's still young, after all.")
('Van', "You shoppin' around for a gift?")
('Risette', 'Heehee, I am.')
('Risette', "It's for one of my Marduk colleagues in Ored.")
('Risette', 'Her birthday is next month.')
('Van', 'A coworker from Marduk? She also a concierge?')
('Risette', "She is indeed. One of our very best, too.<br/>She's primarily in charge of operations in the<br/>free cities.")

('Van', 'Has quite an eye for details.')

('Risette', "She's aware of my circumstances. Despite the state<br/>I'm in, she's always incredibly patient and has stuck<br/>with me throughout my practical tests.")

('Sr. Officer Paul', "It's pretty sickening. Under the eyes of the law, every<br/>race in the republic is equal. Their nonsense<br/>propaganda's against the law on that alone.")

('Melise', "How about a book? Oooh, I could take something I<br/>don't usually read! It'll just add to the whole<br/>new experience!")
('Melise', "Yes! They're letting me come along to the next<br/>business trip!")
('Melise', "Not a lot of people wanted to go 'cause it has to do<br/>with our orbal products, and people think those are a<br/>real hassle.")

('Melise', 'B-But we should take it easy, yeah? I heard from your<br/>wife that you get really rowdy after a few drinks.')
(15293, 'Right, right. Guess bar hopping will have to be<br/>limited to only two bars tonight!')
('Melise', '(No! That does NOT make this better! Why do I<br/>even have to go out for drinks with you?! That was<br/>NOT in my contract!)')

('Clarissa', "Of course I'm worried about the emergency state, but<br/>I still need to go to the store.")

('Giordano', "By the by, there's checkpoints all over the city.<br/>'S takin' me forever to get anywhere.")
('Giordano', "No one's allowed in or outta the capital. 'S a<br/>deadlock, through and through.")
('Giordano', "This whole thing's gotten real messy. Take care<br/>of yourself. Will ya, brother?")
('Giordano', "Ain't no one can blame a brother for shedding tears<br/>in the name of another soul.")
('Giordano', "Heh, don't stress so much, brother! Sure, ya didn't get<br/>there on time, but ya haven't missed yer chance yet!")
('Giordano', "Giordano knows these streets like the back of<br/>'is hand! I'll make sure to take you there!")
('Giordano', "Oooh, baby. There's this nice place to grab a bite in<br/>front of the station. Blew some good ass cash in there.")
('Giordano', "'Cause of my job, I know a bunch of the good eateries<br/>in Edith.")
('Giordano', "But Shino's Bar? Ain't ever heard of it. I'll keep it<br/>in mind.")
('Giordano', "Heh, that's a good reason if I've ever heard one!<br/>No need to stress, Giordano's gonna make it happen<br/>in record time!")
('Giordano', "Edith Central Station, North Exit... Man, I wonder<br/>just how many people I've picked up in 'ere.")
('Giordano', 'Got an officer running late, this fam on vacation,<br/>this shady ass politician, some guy off to propose to<br/>his girl...')
('Giordano', "All in a day's work! 'Tis a taxi driver's life, getting<br/>people and feelings to their destinations.")
('Giordano', 'Now then... What kinda folks am I gonna take for a<br/>ride today?')
('Giordano', "Hey, brother. Nice night, don't ya think? Feels like<br/>the breeze will just blow my worries away.")
('Giordano', "It's only natural to wanna go out on a night like this.<br/>I can take ya for a ride, if you please.")
('Agnès', 'Umm...<br/>(This is kind of a...unique taxi.)')
('Van', "(Heh, that's one hell of a ride. Kinda wanna check it<br/>out, to be honest.)")
('Van', "Sorry, man. Gonna have to pass on this one.<br/>Where I'm going's just 'round the corner.")
('Giordano', 'Ah, forgetaboutit!')
('Giordano', "The name's Giordano. Brother, if ya need anything,<br/>give me a holler.")
('Giordano', "Name's Giordano. I'm kind of a big name around<br/>here, ya know.")
('Giordano', "If ya need to get anywhere in a hurry, then I'm<br/>your guy. I'll be there when you need me, brother.")
('Giordano', 'Hey brother, I got ya covered. Wanna get back to<br/>your beloved family ASAP, yeah?')
('Secretary Culleo', "Ahaha, yes. You see, it's my daughter's<br/>birthday today.")
('Secretary Culleo', "I'm usually not even in the country, since I<br/>work abroad. I wanna get back home as soon as<br/>humanly possible.")
('Giordano', "Hah! That's a good reason if I ever heard one.<br/>You're a hero to your fam, brother.")
('Giordano', "Come on, get in! Giordano's gonna make your wish<br/>come true at record speed!")
('Clutch', "Damn it! I was heading to my senior's wedding today,<br/>and then I just HAD to get on the wrong bus...")
('Clutch', "Argh, I'm not gonna make it! I even got him a<br/>present and everything!")
('Giordano', "No need for tears, brother. Ain't over till the fat lady<br/>sings, ye?")
('Clutch', "B-But it's getting late...")
('Giordano', "Heh. Listen close, brother. It's the thought that<br/>counts, and that's why I'm in the business of taking<br/>your thoughts from A to B.")
('Giordano', "I'm sure you've prepared a wonderful gift for that<br/>senior o' yours.")
('Giordano', 'No shame in that, is there? Only one thing to do,<br/>brother, and you already know what it is!')
('Clutch', "Y-You're right! Being late is already lame enough, but<br/>I can't flake out completely! I have to at least give him<br/>his gift!")
('Clutch', 'P-Please, take me to the party!')
('Clutch', 'There are too many things to do around town!<br/>How am I supposed to know where to even<br/>get started?')
('Clutch', "Well, maybe I'll just take a look around first.<br/>Wandering around can be its own sort of fun.")
('Clutch', 'If only job hunting was this enjoyable! Haha...')
('Clutch', "*groan* I've talked to loads of people from this<br/>company, but nothing's clicking.")
('Clutch', "It's a prestigious place and all the higher ups<br/>seem nice. I don't want to say no definitively, but<br/>I dunno...")
('Clutch', "Aaand I'm lost.")
('Clutch', 'In the streets or in general? Man, I wish I knew.')
('Clutch', "I got this other company's info session coming up but<br/>I still have no clue where I should even apply for.")
('Clutch', "Here's hoping I don't end up getting lost before the<br/>actual interview. That's the kinda thing I get<br/>nightmares about.")
('Clutch', 'Oh! How about I only apply to places that are easy to<br/>get to?')
('Clutch', "'Notice: Several bus routes have been altered in<br/>accordance with the declared state of emergency.'<br/>WHAT?!")
('Clutch', 'How am I supposed to know where to go now?!')
('Clutch', "Why did this have to happen, too? Agh, today's just<br/>been one thing after the other!")
('Clutch', "I just picked up a new book. It's called Memory<br/>Training for Dummies.")
('Clutch', 'I think all my problems might have something to do<br/>with my memory.')
('Clutch', "I mean, I'm really clumsy and get lost all the time.<br/>I don't think it's a stretch, yeah?")
('Clutch', "I daydream too much? Huh? What's that gotta do<br/>with anything? I'm talking about my memory here!")
('Clutch', 'Hmm. I might get the hang of it if I practice<br/>every day...')
('Clutch', "But I gotta be careful or I'm gonna miss my bus.")
('Clutch', "Aidios, I'm pathetic. But it'd be even worse if I just<br/>gave up here...")
('Clutch', "Even if I don't make it in time for the party, I can still<br/>give him his wedding present!")
('Clutch', "One of the seniors is getting married today, and<br/>I'm invited!")
('Clutch', "No more worrying about job hunting! Tonight, it's<br/>time to PAR-TY!")
('Clutch', "I even got him a present! I'll surprise him with it at<br/>the party.")
('Clutch', 'I had a company information session today but ended<br/>up being late...')
('Clutch', "Not very useful for picking where to work if I don't<br/>hear anything about the place.")
('Clutch', "*sigh* I also ended up forgetting my umbrella. If I<br/>don't hurry home, I'll catch a cold.")
('Clutch', "I'll be graduating school soon, and so the job<br/>hunt begins.")
('Clutch', "I just...don't really know what I wanna do. I've never<br/>been good at anything...")
('Clutch', "Man, this isn't good. I'm gonna miss my bus!")
('Clutch', 'I ended up getting lost in thought...')
('Clutch', "*sigh* Never mind the bus. It's life I need to make<br/>sure I don't get lost in.")
('Clutch', "Trion Tower's the ideal place if you want to party<br/>around Edith. It's in the 3rd District.")
('Clutch', "Tyrell's pretty close, though. That's the 4th District.<br/>The streets are really pretty and there's a lot of<br/>stores around.")
('Clutch', "I know there's a bus that goes through both of them,<br/>but...umm...I can't remember which one it was.")
('Clutch', "I feel like I'm forgetting something... Something to<br/>do with the Tyrell District...")
('Clutch', "Oh, well! Couldn't have been anything important if<br/>I forgot!")
('Clutch', "I'll go to Tyrell once I remember what the heck I was<br/>gonna do there.")
('Clutch', 'Wait, I thought this bus was going to the<br/>5th District. Why am I back at the station?')
('Clutch', 'Did I get on the tour bus instead?')
('Clutch', 'Aww, whatever. That kinda stuff just happens when<br/>you live in the capital.')
('Clutch', 'You can get anywhere in Edith if you use the metro.')
('Clutch', "Edith's buses are pretty good, too.")
('Clutch', "There's bus stops pretty much everywhere you'd<br/>wanna go. We also got buses that go all 'round the<br/>city, and options for long distance travel.")
('Clutch', "You can even take a bus out of the country! Though I<br/>guess it's not as amusing if you've been living in the<br/>city for a while.")
('Clutch', "Where are y'all going?")
('Clutch', "Gotta take good advantage of the buses while you're<br/>in the city!")
('Gretta', 'Ugh, getting back together with my ex would<br/>totally blow.')
('Gretta', 'But not having anyone to go out with during the<br/>festival would suck so hard...')
('Gretta', 'Kopeyka gets real weird sometimes...')
('Gretta', "I don't even know what she's talking about half<br/>the time! I'm normal, unlike her!")
('Gretta', "Did you see this week's issue of<br/>Tyrell Entertainment? Judith looked so freaking cool!")
('Kopeyka', 'Heck yeah! I was so psyched for those pics of her<br/>new movie!')
('Kopeyka', "I'm more of a Nina stan, but Judith looked pretty fire<br/>this week.")
('Gretta', "Right?! And I was super hyped to see Elaine in last<br/>week's edition!")
('Gretta', 'What do you think are the chances I meet her<br/>one day? We, like, live in the same city!')
('Gretta', "Trion Tower, lit up by the sunset... Oh, it's<br/>so dreamy!")
('Gretta', "Look, Kopeyka! Doesn't the sky look<br/>absolutely gorgeous?!")
('Kopeyka', 'Man, I wish I was that happy-go-lucky.')
('Gretta', "What're you implying?! I have more than one brain<br/>cell, you know!")
('Kopeyka', "Not what I said. But your last brain cell's working as<br/>good as ever.")
('Gretta', 'That reminds me of my ex! Used to say he totally<br/>looked like this one Z1 racer.')
('Gretta', 'Man, what a tryhard! It was such a turn-off!')
('Kopeyka', "I forget what that dude's called. Ugh, I watched that<br/>race, too! He had some mad skills, I gotta say.")
('Kopeyka', 'Who I really got the hots for is the president, though.')
('Gretta', "It's his voice, isn't it?! I could totally melt in it!")
('Kopeyka', "Gretta, I'm SOOO bored! Nothing, like, even<br/>interests me anymore, you know...")
('Gretta', 'Again? You get bored so easy. Should I get the hottie<br/>collection out?')
('Kopeyka', 'Nah, not the whole thing. Just top rung. Who was<br/>it, again?')
('Gretta', "First there's Prince Albert, of course. And we got<br/>Lapharl and Prince Sherid... Oh, and I've been<br/>thinking of that reporter dude I saw a bit ago...")
('Kopeyka', "I swear there wasn't this many last time...")
('Kopeyka', "Oh, this picture's gonna look so good! I got a banger<br/>angle on it!")
('Gretta', "Hey, Kopeyka. Don't we come by Trion Tower all<br/>the time?")
('Gretta', "I thought you'd said you were bored of it.")
('Gretta', "But now you're all up in it, talking about getting the<br/>'perfect shot' and all that. I don't get you!")
('Kopeyka', "Aww, chill out! You know it's for social media! I told<br/>you I got into that recently.")
('Kopeyka', 'You totally gotta like my post, Gretta!')
('Gretta', "Like—what? That's it. I lost you. You're just speaking<br/>in another language.")
('Gretta', "Did you see the lottery odds for this year's EGC?")
('Kopeyka', "EGC? That's the Edith Girls' Collection, yeah?<br/>They hold that event in Trion Tower at the end of<br/>the year.")
('Kopeyka', "We're totally gonna try to get in! There will be so<br/>many cool actresses and models in it, we gotta go!<br/>This year's gonna be in-SANE, though.")
('Gretta', "Those odds are, like, totes impossible to win!<br/>There's gotta be something you can do, yeah?")
('Kopeyka', "(Oooh, I'd totally go viral if I posted pictures of<br/>the EGC! People will go crazy for shots of all those<br/>super stars!)")
('Kopeyka', "Oookie dokie. I'll sniff around online, see if I figure<br/>out how we can get some tickets.")
('Gretta', 'For real?! Yesss! Let me know if I can help<br/>with anything.')
('Gretta', "You're an actual genius, girl! It blows my mind,<br/>I swear.")
('Kopeyka', "I...haven't done anything yet...<br/>(Is there anything between those ears of yours? I legit<br/>worry it's just air sometimes.)")
('Gretta', "The news has been all gloomy lately. When's it<br/>gonna end?")
('Gretta', 'Going out is real scary, but being cooped up feels<br/>SO miserable!')
('Kopeyka', "Been doomscrolling online forums all day.<br/>You should probably stay away from them, Gretta.<br/>It's real depressing.")
('Kopeyka', "But, like, what's gonna happen now? Are we gonna<br/>be trapped inside the capital forever because of this<br/>mafia stuff?")
('Gretta', "On the bright side, that handsome aide has been<br/>poppin' up in the news all the time!")
('Gretta', "It's really crowded around, now that the Revolution<br/>Festival is right around the corner.")
('Gretta', 'Spot any cute guys yet?')
('Kopeyka', 'Do you ever think about anything else, Gretta?')
('Gretta', "Aww, cut me some slack! You know how bummed I<br/>was we didn't get tickets to the EGC.")
('Gretta', "I'm so pathetic! Not just depressed, but<br/>SINGLE, too!")
('Kopeyka', '(Uhh, so am I? Or does that not matter to you?)')
('Kopeyka', "They're testing the festival's lighting tonight!")
('Kopeyka', "This is totally gonna be post-worthy! Can't wait for<br/>the likes to come rollin' in!")
('Gretta', "I really don't understand what the heck you're on<br/>about sometimes.")
('Kopeyka', 'Oh. Actually, I forgot to mention that I did get one<br/>ticket to the EGC.')
('Gretta', 'WHAAAAAAT?!')
('Gretta', "Why didn't you say that earlier?! Come on,<br/>what were you biting your tongue for?! I can't<br/>BELIEVE you! That's, like, mind-blowing!")
('Kopeyka', "Wait, wait, wait. Pump the breaks there a li'l.<br/>It wasn't even a minute ago that you were getting all<br/>depresso on me.")
('Gretta', "This is the EGC we're talking about!<br/>The EG-freaking-C! Think about all those models<br/>and actresses you'll get to meet!")
('Gretta', 'Oooh, this is so exciting! And on the day of the<br/>festival, too, yeah? This. Is. So. HYPE!')
('Kopeyka', "(It's like her excitement saps away all of mine in<br/>an instant.)")
('Gretta', "The EGC's in the evening, yeah? Wanna look around<br/>before it starts?")
('Kopeyka', 'Well, duh!')
('Kopeyka', "I was planning on taking some photos, too.<br/>How 'bout we stop by the Revolution<br/>Memorial Plaza?")
('Gretta', "Hella! Let's have some FUN!")
('Gretta', "Wh-Wh-What the HECK is going on?! This is<br/>getting freaky! W-We're totally gonna die!")
('Kopeyka', 'I-I dunno! But we gotta lay low for now.')
('Kopeyka', "But this is totally picture-worthy! And my camera's<br/>working, too.")
('Gretta', 'K-Kopeyka, you are WAY too chilled out right now!<br/>B-But it helps calm me down...')
('Kopeyka', "N-Nah. I'm a total mess, really. I'm only this calm<br/>'cause you're here.")
('Gretta', 'H-H-How did it come out? Got those monsters in<br/>the frame?')
('Kopeyka', 'Oh, dear. This is nuts...')
('Kopeyka', "They're not showing up! Th-That's SO freaky!")
('Gretta', "Eeeeeek! They're SO not from this world!")
('Risette', "(Huh. They're not showing up on photographs, but<br/>our Xipha's are recording them without major issue.)")
('Van', "(It's gotta have to do with the shard functions<br/>installed, I guess.)")
('Van', "(Or not. Dunno what the heck's goin' on, now that<br/>time's stopped.)")
('Gretta', "This is SO freaky! Kopeyka, what's gonna happen<br/>to us?!")
('Kopeyka', 'Gretta, please give me some space... But, like, not<br/>too much!')
('Kopeyka', '(Oh, right. I totally forgot to check that<br/>online application.)')
('Kopeyka', '(I applied thirty times for the hell of it. I have to have<br/>won SOMETHING, right?)')
('Kopeyka', "I saw my dad browsing this thing called 'social media'<br/>on his orbal computer the other day.")
('Kopeyka', "It's actually kinda cool. You can post all sorts of<br/>things there, and people can 'like' your posts<br/>and stuff! It feels real nice when you get 'em.")
('Kopeyka', "Not a lot of girls posting about their day-to-day yet, so<br/>it's the perfect niche for me to swoop in and fill!")
('Hazel', 'We could collaborate with the CID in a<br/>limited capacity.')
('Hazel', 'Our efforts are already underway, so their cooperation<br/>should help speeding up matters.')
('Hazel', "I'd advise caution if you guys will keep this up.<br/>And I'd appreciate if you kept me up to date<br/>regarding your findings.")
('Hazel', 'Weird as things might be, we still have to use the<br/>resources at our disposal to help handle things.')
('Hazel', 'Our limited grasp of the situation, however, is our<br/>biggest handicap.')
('Hazel', "It's hard to believe that this phenomenon was caused<br/>by humans in the first place...")
('Hazel', 'Regardless of that, we have to find a way to get<br/>through this.')
('Hazel', "Though orbal devices have technically stopped, it<br/>looks like there's something working within<br/>them still.")
('Hazel', "I hope I can at least get in touch with Leman's<br/>head branch...")
('Hazel', "Hmm... Anyway, we've got to start working on<br/>finding a solution.")
('Hazel', 'Hello there. Nice seeing you take time out of your<br/>busy schedule to come see us.')
('Van', "Don't get the wrong idea. I haven't agreed to<br/>helpin' out.")
('Agnès', 'Ahaha... The guild has a lot on their plate, as usual.')
('Feri', 'I guess the guild must be busy.')
('Aaron', 'Heh. Got your hands full, eh?')
('Risette', 'Haha... The guild really is busy.')
('Quatre', "It's not hard to see you've all got your hands full.")
('Judith', "I don't even work here, but the guild does look like<br/>they could use a hand.")
('Bergard', 'Heh. No getting around it. They really have their<br/>hands full.')
('Hazel', 'Oh, this year took us by surprise in particular.')
('Hazel', "We got the whole team taking shifts, but I'm not sure<br/>that's far enough to cover all our bases.")
('Hazel', "Heh, I guess we'll have to start lookin' for extra help.")
('Van', "Is it the 'don't get the wrong idea' or the 'haven't<br/>agreed to help' part that you ain't getting?<br/>(Damn it. Dude's getting on my nerves.)")
('Agnès', '(We need to keep our wits about us as we make our<br/>way around. We still have to worry about that<br/>case, too.)')
('Feri', '(We still need to worry about THAT, too. We better<br/>keep our eyes peeled.)')
('Aaron', "(Guess if that certain pain in the ass isn't gonna go<br/>away, we might as well try to keep an eye on it.)")
('Risette', '(There is still the matter in question to consider...<br/>We, too, should be vigilant as we make our rounds.)')
('Quatre', "(Well, we do have that matter to worry about.<br/>Let's take try to take care of it while we're going<br/>around town.)")
('Judith', '(We should probably watch out, all<br/>things considered.)')
('Bergard', "(With that certain issue ongoing, we'd best keep our<br/>wits about us.)")
('Hazel', "Now, while I know today's the festival, this is the<br/>Bracer Guild. We need to be prepared for everything.")
('Hazel', 'Festivities are being held everywhere today.')
('Hazel', "Regardless of the branch, our bracers have their<br/>hands full. They'll hopefully be able to take a break<br/>here and there while on patrol.")
('Hazel', "A report's just come in from Luka, the receptionist<br/>for the Oración branch.")
('Hazel', 'Everything got real complicated, real fast, but<br/>negotiations were underway to help get things<br/>under control.')
('Hazel', 'She used all resources available to her to prevent the<br/>worst case scenario from unfolding. She really did a<br/>wonderful job there.')
('Hazel', 'Luka, my granddaughter, has been heartbroken over<br/>not being able to prevent what happened in<br/>Creil Village.')
('Hazel', "But she did a good job, where she could.<br/>Creil's tragedy isn't something she should shoulder<br/>by herself.")
('Hazel', "Oh, it's you. Dealing with the aftermath has been a<br/>whole lot more complicated than at first thought.")
('Hazel', "They've managed to evade pursuit by leaving trails of<br/>dummy info to throw us off.")
('Hazel', "Elaine did a bang-up job in Oración, at least.<br/>That's definitely helped matters.")
('Hazel', "And it doesn't look like she's going<br/>anywhere, thankfully. Couldn't be happier about her<br/>staying with the guild.")
('Hazel', 'President Auclair has been cooperating with<br/>the interrogations.')
('Hazel', "Her father's condition is also a concern, but he's still<br/>been a great help piecing everything together.")
('Hazel', 'We have other things to worry about still. Like the<br/>situation with Gray.')
('Hazel', "At the very least, we can take a somewhat smaller<br/>break now. That's something worth celebrating.")
('Hazel', "As you can see, things are incredibly hectic<br/>around here. It's never enough hands on deck, no<br/>matter how many of us there are.")
('Hazel', 'If the announcement is anything to go by, the<br/>casualties number more than a thousand.<br/>The situation is unprecedented.')
('Hazel', 'The Leman headquarters have ordered the guild to<br/>operate at full capacity in this situation.')
('Hazel', 'You never know what could happen, so do be careful.')
('Hazel', 'A kid from Creil was over visiting at the time.<br/>Mere coincidence, really, but it saved his life.')
('Hazel', 'Unfortunately, his friends and family were not<br/>so lucky. I wish I could be there to lend my support...')
('Hazel', 'But alas, my hands are full. Someone else will have to<br/>take care of him.')
('Hazel', 'We did receive a report, but there are a few things<br/>that still concern me.')
('Bracer Ewan', 'Luka and I are planning to continue with our analysis<br/>in an attempt to get some answers.')
('Hazel', 'Oh, yeah? Good to hear my good-for-nothing<br/>granddaughter is turning into a good-for-something.')
('Bracer Ewan', "To be honest, she's...kind of terrifying. In spite of her<br/>young age, she's become the Oración<br/>branch's backbone.")
('Bracer Ewan', "She may have only been with us for a year, but I don't<br/>know anyone that would argue with me on<br/>that statement.")
('Hazel', "Oho, no need for flattery! I'm sure you're<br/>just exaggerating. It still does me good to hear that<br/>she's well.")
('Hazel', "Tell her to stop by again sometime, won't you?")
('Hazel', "I'm relieved to hear my granddaughter has been doing<br/>well at the Oración branch.")
('Hazel', 'A young man has been coming to help me with my<br/>office work as well.')
('Hazel', 'It might help with efficiency if we took in some more<br/>staff for the back office.')
('Hazel', "I just saw three of our people off a little bit ago.<br/>They're off on a work trip.")
('Hazel', "Though they mentioned they'd have dinner out, so I<br/>might be able to join them somewhere.")
('Hazel', 'Hopefully, things will stay uneventful, but take care<br/>of yourselves.')
('Hazel', "I won't deny that I'm still worried over some things,<br/>but I'll just have to power through and keep working<br/>with the other branches.")
('Hazel', 'Hmm... Might be a good idea to look into that<br/>case again.')
('Hazel', 'But we might also be too understaffed to do that<br/>right now. *sigh* What a headache.')
('Risette', '(So the guild is proceeding with their own<br/>independent investigations.)')
('Van', "(Yeah, and it sounds like they're having a tough go<br/>of it, like the rumors said.)")
('Van', "(Hope that ain't gonna affect us.)")
('Hazel', "The Republic is massive. If you're talking just size, it's<br/>definitely the biggest in the continent.")
('Hazel', "And it's not just wide in its territory. We're also a<br/>melting pot of cultures and ethnicities in here. A little<br/>bit from everywhere we border.")
('Hazel', "It's our job to keep the balance in the continent.<br/>That, of course, includes dealing with the<br/>East's desertification.")
('Hazel', "Now then... This looks like a good schedule for<br/>next week. A little on the safe side, but it'll work.")
('Hazel', "Zin's out right now. Had some urgent business to<br/>attend to. I'm sure he'll be back before we know<br/>it, though.")
('Hazel', "He's been awfully busy nowadays, what with being the<br/>face of the guild and all. I was the one that pushed<br/>him to do it.")
('Hazel', "But I fear that may have put too much pressure on<br/>him in the process. Oh, well. He's built of<br/>sturdy stuff. I'm sure he'll manage.")
('Hazel', "Elaine's much the same. I understand why she would<br/>shy away from the limelight, but we need all our best<br/>talent doing their best effort.")
('Hazel', "We need to be cautious. I can't say much more<br/>than that.")
('Hazel', 'Usually, any bracer below B-rank is strictly forbidden<br/>from working alone when it comes to matters<br/>regarding A.')
('Hazel', "That doesn't mean we won't make an exception here<br/>and there, though. For example, that girl that arrived<br/>earlier today.")
('Hazel', "Haha, it's challenging, for sure. I just want to make<br/>sure I'm setting all the youngsters up for success.")
('Hazel', "Oh, you must be Arkride Solution's new recruit.")
('Hazel', "I know you're still pretty much a rookie, but I'm<br/>rootin' for ya, kiddo.")
('Feri', "Th-Thanks.<br/>(Everyone's been keeping an eye on me...)")
('Van', "(Who wouldn't? Almost like you're not aware you're<br/>a jaeger.)")
('Agnès', '(Ahaha... The guild and the jaeger corps are basically<br/>like cats and dogs.)')
('Agnès', "(But I feel like Feri's better suited for our kind<br/>of work.)")
('Hazel', "(At least she's in good company. She's a Kruga, too.<br/>Should be okay to leave it alone for now, at least.)")
('Hazel', "Getting down to business, we've confirmed<br/>movement from both Almata's leaders and from<br/>Ouroboros' Enforcers.")
('Hazel', "There's been movement from them both in the past<br/>few years.")
('Hazel', "And we're all aware of Heiyue's movements, so all we<br/>need to figure out is how to go about handling the<br/>film festival.")
('Hazel', "We'll hold another meeting once Alvis and Regina<br/>are back.")
('Hazel', "Well, well! What special occasion brings our famed<br/>spriggan and his crew 'round these parts?")
('Hazel', 'Your reputation precedes you, you sly dog.')
('Hazel', 'Look at you, managing to get your way with both<br/>criminals AND the CID.')
('Hazel', "Heard you'll be lendin' a hand here. You're no doubt<br/>a busy man, but I'd love it if you could handle some<br/>stuff here for me.")
('Van', "*sigh* He just couldn't keep quiet, huh...")
('Van', "(And then there's this geezer. Keep the grin all you<br/>like, old man. Ain't a single bone in my body that<br/>trusts you.)")
('Agnès', "(Y-Yeah. He looks kind, but I can't help but feel<br/>that there's a shrewd side to him, too...)")
('Van', "(He's the guild receptionist in the Republic's capital.<br/>Can't imagine he's just your run of the mill vet.)")
('Hazel', "Come on, no need to be so wary. We've been<br/>short-staffed for a very long time now, and it's caused<br/>us our fair share of problems.")
('Hazel', 'The Bracer Guild has been looking out for the<br/>common citizen for at least half a century, but<br/>nothing in that time compares to the past few years.')
('Hazel', "I'd be grateful if you could join us in supporting the<br/>capital's citizenry, not to mention the residents of<br/>Calvard as a whole.")
('Van', "(Can't help but feel he's testin' me a little here...<br/>Well, whatever. Guess the extra cash won't hurt.)")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Oh, hey. Here to take some work off our hands?')
('Van', "Nope! I just happened to stop by. Lookin' into<br/>somethin' else right now that's kinda related.")
('Hazel', "Sorry to break it to ya, loverboy, but Elaine's not<br/>around right now.")
('Van', "That's not why I'm here either!<br/>(Man, I wouldn't wanna deal with you guys on<br/>the daily.)")
('Agnès', 'Umm... May I ask what you were talking about?')
('Feri', 'What were you talking about?')
('Aaron', "Damn. Age getting to you, chief? Thought you'd be<br/>able to hold your own against these two at least.")
('Van', "Zip it, you. Anyway, spill it. What were you<br/>talking 'bout?")
('Hazel', 'I just got the final report on the Langport incident.')
('Agnès', "Oh. What's in it?")
('Feri', "Oh. What's in it?")
('Aaron', "What's the verdict?")
('Zin the Immovable', 'There were over twenty casualties.')
('Zin the Immovable', "Langport's starting to quiet down, but the whole<br/>thing ain't over. The guild still needs to keep a close<br/>eye on the situation.")
('Hazel', 'Yes, but we need to be careful on our end, too.')
('Van', "What're you gettin' at?")
('Van', 'I wish I was exaggerating... The guild and the police<br/>have been looking into Almata.')
('Van', 'I suspect Heiyue, the CID, and other organizations<br/>are likely doing the same.')
('Van', 'However, every attempt to probe Almata with<br/>undercover agents has ended in failure. Many bracers<br/>and police officers have lost their lives.')
('Agnès', 'Some bracers lost their lives, too...')
('Feri', 'There were bracers among the victims as<br/>well, right?')
('Aaron', 'Geez. How long has this beef between the guild and<br/>Almata been going on for?')
('Zin the Immovable', "You probably heard it from Elaine already, but that's<br/>why we're short on staff.")
('Zin the Immovable', "Don't wanna put any undue pressure on you lot, but<br/>cooperatin' wouldn't be a half bad idea if we had<br/>the chance.")
('Van', 'Just like Langport, yeah? I might be down.')
('Hazel', "Haha, that's good enough for me. I appreciate it.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Hey, Arkride. I owe you one for your help today.')
('Zin the Immovable', "Got a bunch of our eggs in a row now, so we won't be<br/>stepping 'round too many eggshells from here on.")
('Hazel', "Maybe it's wishful thinking, but if this was the push<br/>that could help us get Almata under control, that'd<br/>be great.")
('Van', "You're layin' it on so thick I don't even wanna think<br/>of a witty comeback.")
('Van', "We helped out with all these punks that have been<br/>movin' recently. Far as I'm concerned, the rest ain't<br/>my job.")
('Zin the Immovable', "Ouch, that's cold. But that's all right, haha.<br/>Figures you're looking out for your folks instead.")
('Hazel', "The CID's all over this mess. Thankfully, that in and<br/>of itself might be enough of a deterrent to keep things<br/>quiet around town.")
('Hazel', "But there aren't as many eyes keeping careful watch<br/>in more rural areas. Take care on that work trip you<br/>got next week.")
('Van', 'How the hell do you already know that?!')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Headquarters back in Leman are also working on<br/>this case.')
('Zin the Immovable', "We're all working our hardest here. You do the<br/>same, Arkride.")
('Zin the Immovable', "Elaine's working right now, by the way. I feel like<br/>she's been working too hard lately.")
('Zin the Immovable', "She's a hard worker, sure, but I wish she'd learn to<br/>take it easy from time to time.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'She definitely needs the free time. You should invite<br/>her over for a movie or two!')
('Zin the Immovable', "Haha, did I cross a line there? Sorry! Can tell by just<br/>lookin' at you, that's a touchy subject.")
('Van', "Y'all gotta cut it out! Elaine's probably tired of this<br/>shit, too.")
('Van', "Ain't none of your business.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Hazel and I have been talking about<br/>personnel distribution.')
('Zin the Immovable', "Elaine's been doing a great job keeping up with all<br/>her work, even on top of everything else popping up.<br/>Doing a bang-up job as a newbie A-rank.")
('Zin the Immovable', "But I don't think she should be handling all of this<br/>all alone. Ideally, multiple people would be tackling<br/>these things together.")
('Zin the Immovable', "While we can't afford to ignore Ouroboros right now,<br/>Almata's our priority.")
('Zin the Immovable', "There are other things I wish I could look into, but<br/>I'm really busy, too...")
('Zin the Immovable', "I'm counting on you guys, too. Don't disappoint!")
('Elaine', "Almata's funds are coming from this organization<br/>they're contracting with. I need to look into<br/>it further...")
('Elaine', 'And you. You need to be more careful.')
('Elaine', "It won't take much snooping on your part for you to<br/>paint a target on your back.")
('Elaine', "By the time you realize it, it'll already be too late.<br/>Be sure to talk to the guild before you do<br/>anything reckless. Understood?")
('Elaine', 'You need to be more on guard, you know.')
('Elaine', "Aidios, you are always so careless. Are all men like<br/>this, or just you? I don't care if this is just how you do<br/>things, but you need to be careful...")
('Van', '(Better make myself scarce. Not in the mood for a<br/>lecture today.)')
('Elaine', "I have a rough idea of what's going on, but it's still<br/>not fully adding up.")
('Elaine', '*sigh* We need to be careful when dealing<br/>with Almata.')
('Elaine', "Still, can't afford to rest on my laurels. I'll take<br/>advantage of Alvis and Regina filling in for me on<br/>that trip to look into things further.")
('Elaine', "I'd appreciate it if you guys kept your heads low in<br/>the meantime. And Van? Let us know if something<br/>comes up.")
('Van', 'Yeah, yeah.')
('Fie', "The guild's policies are firm. We know what to do.<br/>We just have to wait for the right moment.")
('Fie', "I imagine we're not the only ones on the move.<br/>Some of our associates might be on the move already,<br/>so we need to coordinate with them.")
('Fie', "I'm worried about Elaine, but I'll trust you to take<br/>care of her.")
('Van', "I'm not her nanny, you know. But fine. I'll keep an<br/>eye out for her.")
('Fie', "Huh. Guess Van's the shy type, too.")
('Van', "I dunno what you're on about, but quit it.")
('Fie', "Hey, Van. Don't see you around often.")
('Van', 'I only swing by every now and then to check up<br/>on things.')
('Van', "I guess Elaine's not around? I see Zin's back...")
('Fie', "You don't need to be coy, you know.")
('Fie', "I know you and Elaine have something going on, but<br/>I didn't know you and Zin didn't get along.")
('Fie', 'I always found him easy to be around.')
('Van', "I mean, he is. But he's nosy. Even if I try to stay<br/>distant, it's like he sees right through me.")
('Van', 'Well, I guess he also reminds me of someone I used<br/>to know...')
('Fie', 'Huh. Zin really likes you, though.')
('Fie', 'You two went to the Blacklight District earlier<br/>today, yeah? He was talking about asking you for help<br/>again later.')
('Van', 'The big-mouthed idiot...')
('Van', 'At least Elaine and Sara are easier on the eyes than<br/>he is. The better looking A-rank bracers.')
('Fie', 'Now that you mention it, you know Sara and<br/>Toval, yeah?')
('Fie', 'When did you meet them? Operation Jormungandr?<br/>Or was it for the Northern War?')
('Van', 'Yeah. I helped sniff around for an infiltration route<br/>from here in Calvard.')
('Van', "Toval's pretty easy to get along with. He's flawed, but<br/>he knows his business and makes sure to stick with it.<br/>Made negotiations real easy.")
('Fie', 'Haha, I got my own fair share of flaws, too.')
('Fie', 'Are you interested in meeting the Divine Blade of<br/>Wind or the Lieutenant General of the Royal Army<br/>of Liberl?')
('Van', "I'm sure they're both really impressive, but I'm gonna<br/>pass on that one.")
('Fie', "There's a lot going on in here. I'm busier than I was<br/>back in Erebonia.")
('Fie', 'Got three more reports to write for Hazel.<br/>Wanna help?')
('Van', "I'm not even from the guild! Man, you're lazy.")
('Fie', 'You got me.')
('Fie', "I've known Elaine for a while now, but you can<br/>always learn something new.")
('Fie', "It's fine. I'm not gonna tease you about it.")
('Fie', "I'll be staying in the Republic for a while now that<br/>I'm here. So, catch you around.")
('Bracer Alvis', "I'll take the guild's car around the<br/>neighboring districts.")
('Bracer Alvis', 'Zin and Elaine are doing their own stuff.')
('Bracer Alvis', 'And I take it you guys are on your way out, too.<br/>Hmph, do your best!')
('Van', 'Right back at ya.')
('Risette', 'I wish you the best of luck in your endeavors. Let us<br/>meet again.')
('Bracer Alvis', 'Hmph. Not a fan of Marduk, but I guess we can<br/>count on them to fight with us this time.')
('Bracer Alvis', "We'll get the grip of things, one way or the other.")
('Bracer Alvis', "The ball's in you guys' court now. You better pull<br/>through for us!")
('Van', 'Heh, we will.')
('Bracer Alvis', "We're still dealing with the incident's aftermath, too.")
('Bracer Alvis', "Things are calming down now, but Elaine's still<br/>not back...")
('Bracer Alvis', "Regina's still being optimistic about it, so I'll follow<br/>her example. We have to do all we can to help out.")
('Bracer Alvis', "I was the one assigned to oversee Gray's training.")
('Bracer Alvis', "He's improved a lot since I last saw him. Makes me<br/>feel proud.")
('Bracer Alvis', "He's still got a ways to go, but he'll hopefully keep<br/>it up.")
('Bracer Alvis', 'Might be he needs some more training on top of his<br/>current workload. Or... Nah, I need to give him a<br/>bigger workload, too.')
('Bracer Alvis', "I can't let Ewan outdo me! Not when Elaine's<br/>approval is on the line.")
('Bracer Regina', "(*sigh* I don't get why you're working so hard<br/>for her.)")
('Bracer Alvis', "We're heading out on a work trip.")
('Bracer Alvis', "So don't you dare cause any trouble while we're out!<br/>I'm enacting a strict no mischief policy from here on!")
('Van', '(Ah, the energy of youth.)')
('Agnès', "(I could've sworn they were around the same age...)")
('Bracer Alvis', "*sigh* Got another work trip coming up. I couldn't<br/>say no, but I really don't have the time to relax lately.")
('Bracer Alvis', 'Hold up. I know you guys!')
('Agnès', "You're the bracer we met in Creil Village...")
('Van', "Alvis, yeah? Looks like the guild's real busy<br/>right now.")
('Bracer Alvis', "Yeah, we are! And it's no thanks to you and<br/>that interview!")
('Bracer Regina', 'Ohh. You must be that shady guy Alvis keeps going<br/>on about.')
('Bracer Alvis', 'Regina...')
('Bracer Regina', 'Calm down, Alvis. You always get worked up so easy.')
('Bracer Regina', 'I did get a brief rundown on the incident. You guys<br/>sure know how to keep a cool head under pressure.')
('Bracer Regina', "If you're down for it, I'm sure we could make some<br/>space for you in the team! Zin would definitely<br/>be thrilled.")
('Bracer Alvis', "I won't!")
('Bracer Alvis', "If you're gonna continue to work with the guild, I<br/>won't tolerate any more monkey business! Got it?")
('Feri', "(He's still pretty mad about things.)")
('Van', "(Sure is. Though he's no pushover.)")
('Bracer Regina', "*sigh* I swear... Anyway, I hope we'll get to keep<br/>working together, Arkride.")
('Bracer Alvis', "I can't believe it! Ewan's getting promoted to B-rank<br/>before me!")
('Bracer Alvis', "Damn it! Losing to your rival blows... No, no! I need<br/>to turn this around! It's my time to catch up! No—I'll<br/>surpass him!")
('Bracer Regina', "Come on, Alvis. Calm down. Promotion isn't a race.")
('Bracer Regina', 'The Oración branch has been dealing with a lot<br/>lately. His promotion is probably because of all the<br/>work he did there.')
('Bracer Alvis', 'Yeah, I know... Still...')
('Bracer Alvis', "Renton's pretty much the only one I got left on par<br/>with me, but he's been making good progress, too.")
('Bracer Regina', "There's also the new recruit, too.")
('Bracer Regina', "She might be younger than me, but she's already<br/>a B-rank. I could learn a lot from her.")
('Bracer Alvis', 'Yeah. I need to step up my game. Need to<br/>train harder!')
('Bracer Alvis', "Is that right? Anyway, I'm glad everything went off<br/>without a hitch.")
('Bracer Alvis', "I wasn't expecting monsters to show up, though...<br/>Make sure to record everything in your notebook<br/>before reporting back to me.")
('Bracer Gray', 'Understood. It also gives me the chance to let today<br/>just really sink in.')
('Bracer Gray', "Life's never gonna go as expected, so things coming<br/>out of nowhere now will only help to prepare me<br/>for later!")
('Bracer Alvis', "Haha, that's the spirit!")
('Bracer Lahad', "Huh. Must be a special day if you two are comin'<br/>in together.")
('Bracer Regina', 'Good work today, Lahad. But dang it! We do NOT<br/>have that sorta relationship!')
('Bracer Lahad', "Haha, calm down there. Don't get all up in my case<br/>about it. Not what I was implying.")
('Bracer Alvis', "I don't know what you two are on about, but I'd also<br/>like to thank you for your work in Messeldam today.")
('Bracer Alvis', "We're on our way to a work trip. We'll be back later<br/>tonight, so the capital's all yours for today.")
('Bracer Lahad', "All right. I'll keep an eye on the capital's outskirts,<br/>just to be safe. Don't worry so much, and take<br/>things easy out there.")
('Bracer Regina', 'We will!')
('Bracer Regina', "We'll keep up the rescue efforts, so take care of the<br/>guild here while we're out.")
('Bracer Gray', 'S-Sure...')
('Bracer Gray', "It... It's way too dangerous for you two to go<br/>on alone! What if you get cornered by monsters?!")
('Bracer Alvis', "Don't worry, I'm no pushover, and neither is Regina.")
('Bracer Alvis', "And if things got sticky, I'm sure we can count on<br/>Zin and Elaine to bail us out. Be sure to do your best<br/>for the team, Gray.")
('Bracer Alvis', "Don't you dare die on me. That's an order from<br/>your senior!")
('Bracer Regina', 'Superiors. Take care of yourself, Gray.')
('Bracer Gray', '...')
('Bracer Gray', "...Fine. I promise I won't do anything rash.")
('Bracer Gray', 'But you have to come back safe! Gotta take me out<br/>for drinks again.')
('Bracer Alvis', 'We will!')
('Bracer Regina', "We're still not sure of what's going on at the moment.<br/>Honestly, I'm not even sure what time it is.")
('Bracer Regina', "But it just means we have to be more careful.<br/>Every move counts. We can't be hesitating.")
('Bracer Regina', "This is going to put a lot of pressure on Gray, but I'm<br/>sure he'll manage. I believe in him.")
('Bracer Regina', "There's probably still civilians around the city that<br/>haven't managed to escape. We'll split up for a search<br/>and rescue.")
('Bracer Regina', 'This miasma is slowing us down a lot.')
('Bracer Regina', 'Take care of yourselves, please. And let us know if<br/>something comes up.')
('Bracer Regina', "We might be done by the evening if we're quick<br/>about it. Let's go, Alvis. We'll split up.")
('Bracer Alvis', "All right. You look like you're raring to go.")
('Bracer Alvis', 'Got all that inspiration from that S-rank bracer that<br/>came over for a visit, huh?')
('Bracer Regina', 'Haha, yeah. Reminded me what being a bracer is<br/>all about.')
('Bracer Regina', 'What happened to Ewan was a tragedy, but we need<br/>to keep going. For him.')
('Bracer Lahad', "(Even after what happened to Ewan, meeting that<br/>person has given them quite a kick to keep moving<br/>forward. They're making some steady progress.)")
('Bracer Regina', "We still haven't entirely recovered from<br/>what happened.")
('Bracer Regina', "But it can't be an excuse to stay still. We need to keep<br/>going, for Ewan's sake. We can't tarnish his memory.")
('Bracer Regina', 'Not when I have my seniors and that S-rank bracer to<br/>repay for teaching me so much!')
('Bracer Regina', 'Ewan works in the Oración branch. He started the<br/>year before Alvis and I did.')
('Bracer Regina', "He's a really promising up-and-coming bracer.<br/>He was promoted to B-rank before Alvis was,<br/>after all.")
('Bracer Regina', "Though Alvis isn't that far behind. After everything<br/>that happened last month, he might also be on track<br/>for a promotion to B-rank.")
('Bracer Regina', 'One of our branches is understaffed, so Alvis and I<br/>gotta go on a long business trip soon.')
('Bracer Regina', "He sure is taking his time, though... I hope he won't<br/>leave me to do all the preparations by myself.")
('Bracer Regina', "He just doesn't change at all. Always rude and<br/>inconsiderate, and never even spares me a<br/>second thought.")
('Bracer Regina', '*sigh* But I guess we ARE working on this together.<br/>We have to compromise somewhere.')
('Bracer Regina', "Wish I knew what's taking him so long.")
('Bracer Regina', '*sigh* Alvis is ALWAYS like this...')
('Bracer Regina', "Hold on a sec. Something's not right with<br/>these documents.")
('Bracer Regina', "This file is out of order. Looks like it's a survey from<br/>about a year ago.")
('Bracer Regina', "Guess it's on me to fix it.")
('Bracer Regina', 'Crime rate has been on the rise for the past two years<br/>here in the capital.')
('Bracer Regina', "There's the mafia, sure, but they're not the only ones<br/>we should worry about. We need to be on the lookout<br/>constantly to protect the citizenship.")
('Bracer Regina', "Being on standby for such an event is also a necessary<br/>part of the job, but I'm not sure Alvis sees it that way.")
('Bracer Regina', "Alvis has his whole future ahead of him.<br/>I'm rooting for him.")
('Bracer Regina', "He's actually pretty close to a B-rank promotion.")
('Bracer Regina', "Now, if he could work on that temper of his, we'd<br/>be peachy. That, and that obsession he has<br/>with Elaine...")
('Bracer Regina', "*sigh* Guess I'll have to keep him on a short leash for<br/>the time being.")
('Bracer Alvis', 'Hey! I heard that!')
('Feri', '(Heehee, those two are really funny.)')
('Bracer Regina', "What a strange pair, those two. They don't look like<br/>they came here with a request.")
('Bracer Regina', "Oh, well. Never mind them. Welcome to the<br/>Republic's Bracer Guild branch.")
('Bracer Regina', "Feel free to ask Hazel if you have any questions.<br/>He and Zin are the pillars of Calvard's<br/>guild branches.")
('Bracer Regina', "He'll be able to help in case you need anything.")
('Bracer Regina', "I'm mentoring our newest member now. We're doing<br/>requests together.")
('Bracer Regina', "Gray's really good when it comes to combat, but<br/>there's stuff I'm really worried about.")
('Bracer Regina', "A bracer can't be just a one-trick pony. He needs to<br/>learn to make rational decisions. Hopefully, the<br/>experience he'll gain today will be of use.")
('Bracer Regina', 'Ewan! When did you get to the main branch?')
('Bracer Ewan', "Just now, actually! Thought I'd surprise you guys.")
('Bracer Ewan', 'I wanted to come by earlier to update you guys, but<br/>work and life have kept me busy lately.')
('Bracer Regina', 'Heehee. Everything going well with your<br/>girlfriend, then?')
('Bracer Ewan', "Yup. It's a little embarrassing to talk about, to<br/>be honest. We still have our issues and everything,<br/>of course.")
('Bracer Regina', 'Crema works with the police department, right?<br/>She probably has her hands just as full, really.')
('Bracer Regina', "I'm glad things are going well, despite that.<br/>Hopefully we'll get a chance to hang out soon.")
('Bracer Ewan', "Haha, yeah. I know she'd love to as well. Make sure<br/>to stop by if you come by Oración anytime soon!")
('Bracer Lahad', "We're gathering everyone who can still fight so that<br/>we can conduct a search and rescue.")
('Bracer Lahad', 'I took a look earlier, and thanks to you breaking that<br/>demon sphere, things have calmed down enough for<br/>us to move out.')
('Bracer Lahad', "Hah, thanks for the opportunity, spriggan!<br/>We'll make the most of it!")
('Bracer Lahad', "Leave this place's defense to us! We won't let them<br/>break through, no matter what!")
('Bracer Lahad', "I have my qualms when it comes to Marduk, but we<br/>can't turn away the help right now when we need<br/>it most.")
('Bracer Lahad', "As soon as things calm down over here, we'll search<br/>the neighboring districts for Zin and the others.")
('Bracer Lahad', "Don't let us down!")
('Bracer Lahad', "It's nice seeing you two around. Ahh, it brings<br/>me back. I remember when Zin and I used to take<br/>care of you.")
('Bracer Lahad', 'It looks like you both have taken care of your<br/>own businesses.')
('Bracer Lahad', "Sadly, it doesn't look like love's in the air today.<br/>Though maybe I can get my hopes up with the<br/>Revolution Festival right around the corner.")
('Bracer Lahad', "I'll be leaving the country on a business trip<br/>next week. I'd rather not, considering we're so busy,<br/>but I can't worm my way out of it.")
('Bracer Lahad', "Our relationship with the Empire has improved, but<br/>that doesn't mean it's peachy everywhere. There are<br/>still fires to be put out.")
('Bracer Lahad', "There's the newly independent North Ambria, issues<br/>in the East, and there's Arteria to worry about, too.")
('Bracer Lahad', "And here at home, we still have A to worry about.<br/>Dang, I gotta get going. The sooner I leave, the<br/>sooner I'll be back.")
('Bracer Lahad', 'Oh, right. Alvis asked me for a favor.')
('Bracer Lahad', "*sigh* I'll have to take care of that when I'm back in<br/>the country instead.")
('Bracer Lahad', "Oh, hey. You're that spriggan that Zin's told me so<br/>much about.")
('Bracer Lahad', "Nice to meet you! My name's Lahad. I'm a bracer.")
('Bracer Lahad', "You look like an easygoing guy, and you're not a<br/>troublemaker from what I've heard.")
('Bracer Lahad', "I'm happy to work with anyone, as long as<br/>they're driven. Hope I can count on you!")
('Van', 'Well, it depends.<br/>(He looks like a reasonable guy.)')
('Van', "(He's got a big mouth, but he looks like he can back<br/>it up. I guess that's Edith's bracers for ya.)")
('Agnès', "(He looked really nice to me, but I guess he'd have his<br/>reasons to be wary.)")
('Bracer Lahad', "It's probably not hard to tell, but I'm from the<br/>Central East. I go back on work trips all the<br/>time, too.")
('Bracer Lahad', "Zin, Elaine, and even Al are all out and about. So I'm<br/>the one who got stuck with standby duty.")
('Bracer Lahad', "I can't force you to walk away from that shady<br/>business of yours, but just try not to poke your<br/>nose where it don't belong, all right?")
('Bracer Lahad', "Edith's got a real nasty dark side to it. But you guys<br/>already knew that.")
('Bracer Lahad', "Thanks for the help, Ismail. Ain't easy to deal with<br/>everything now that we're three people down.")
('Bracer Ismail', 'No need to thank me. Fie helped me out yesterday, so<br/>consider it me repaying the favor.')
('Bracer Ismail', 'I heard things finally settled down in Vegas Films.<br/>Enough for a new CEO to step up, anyway.')
('Bracer Ismail', 'What do you think about all of this, Lahad?')
('Bracer Lahad', "I think I know what you're getting at, but if they're<br/>doing their job, then that's all we can really ask for.")
('Bracer Lahad', "Zin DID say they're getting a little nosy for their<br/>own good...")
('Van', "(The hell they talkin' about?)")
('Bracer Regina', "Don't worry so much. You're pretty skilled in and<br/>of yourself. And if you need some help, we got Lahad<br/>around, too.")
('Bracer Gray', "O-Okay. I'll do my best!")
('Bracer Gray', "I promise I won't do anything reckless. So you better<br/>not, either! Come back safe!")
('Bracer Gray', "I'll protect this place with my life!")
('Bracer Gray', 'I-If Almata really is back, then...')
('Bracer Gray', "Ugh! No, we've gotta do everything we can to<br/>stop them!")
(15299, "Thank you, young man. I haven't been to Edith in so<br/>long, I got lost.")
('Bracer Gray', 'Happy to help!')
('Bracer Gray', "You're on your way to see your grandchild, yeah?<br/>Take care!")
('Bracer Gray', "Today's been really busy, but satisfactory. It feels nice<br/>to do something you're proud of.")
('Bracer Gray', "Haha! I've been looking forward to today for so long.<br/>But as a bracer, I can't slack off!")
('Bracer Gray', 'I made the big mistake of going to Oración<br/>without permission. I got in big trouble for it.')
('Bracer Gray', 'Thankfully, my suspension finally got lifted.')
('Bracer Gray', "I may have gotten in big trouble for it, but I'm<br/>thankful I was there to see the mafia being eradicated<br/>with my own eyes.")
('Bracer Gray', 'But according to Lahad, I gotta redo my<br/>training now...')
('Bracer Gray', 'Zin and Hazel had some words for me, too.')
('Bracer Gray', "I caused a lot of trouble for a lot of people. I'm<br/>really sorry.")
('Bracer Gray', 'I have to make it up to everyone! Time to turn over a<br/>new leaf.')
('Bracer Gray', "Ugh... They're really putting me on standby at a time<br/>like this? And as Hazel's assistant, no less!")
('Bracer Gray', "Is it because I'm still a junior bracer? I've been<br/>working really hard for the past six months! Did it<br/>mean nothing?")
('Bracer Gray', "...No, that's no way to think about it.<br/>There's something I can do, and I have to focus on<br/>doing my part.")
('Agnès', "(He's having a hard time...)")
('Bracer Gray', "I'll be dispatched to the provincial towns as part of my<br/>junior bracer training.")
('Bracer Gray', "I'm not sure I want to, but I know the experience will<br/>only help me grow. I can't skip out on it.")
('Bracer Gray', "Wait, now's not the time to get carried away! I need<br/>to get ready.")
('Bracer Gray', 'Need to make sure my weapons are in tip-top shape,<br/>pack my first-aid kit. Hmm... Maybe I should pack<br/>some spares, too.')
('Bracer Gray', 'Alvis and everyone else are leaving on a work<br/>trip today.')
('Bracer Gray', "Haha, maybe I'll be able to at least see them off at<br/>the station.")
('Bracer Gray', "Alvis trains every day after work. He's very diligent.")
('Bracer Gray', "And he's the one training me all the time, too.")
('Bracer Gray', 'I should follow his example. I need to keep training<br/>so I can get stronger!')
('Bracer Gray', "My name is Gray. I'm a junior bracer. I just started<br/>last month.")
('Bracer Gray', "Every day's a new challenge, but it's fulfilling. I'm so<br/>happy I finally got to become a bracer, like I'd always<br/>dreamed of!")
('Bracer Gray', "Junior bracers aren't full-fledged bracers, though!<br/>I still have a lot of hard work ahead of me.")
('Bracer Gray', "There's so much I can and WILL learn from all<br/>my superiors. Every day's a new lesson!")
('Bracer Gray', "Actually, Regina's an orbal staff user. She's a real<br/>pro when it comes to orbal devices, too.")
('Bracer Gray', 'Apparently, she was involved with the trial<br/>implementation of the generic Aeon system, or<br/>something like that.')
('Bracer Gray', "But she's our specialist when it comes to incidents<br/>involving the orbal net. I could stand to learn a lot<br/>from her.")
('Bracer Ewan', "I came by to update the main branch on our research<br/>progress over in Oración. We've been looking into<br/>the mafia.")
('Bracer Ewan', "I haven't been by the capital in a while. I have so<br/>many people I want to at least say hi to. Hazel, of<br/>course, and Zin and Elaine are also a must!")
('Bracer Ewan', "I'd love a chance to talk to Alvis, too, but looks like<br/>he's busy as ever.")
('Manager Carlo', 'Is it true that Station Street was successfully liberated?')
('Manager Carlo', 'Things are safe now, all thanks to Marduk.')
('Manager Carlo', "Ilhan's been having some new ideas, but I can<br/>guarantee you that our store will continue<br/>supporting you.")
('Manager Carlo', "Please, don't hesitate to ask for help!")
('Manager Carlo', "We're none the wiser about what's going on, either.")
('Manager Carlo', "We've gotta pull through. There's people working<br/>hard to get us through this, so we have to make it.")
('Manager Carlo', "If there's anything you'd like to order, don't hesitate<br/>to let me know... And may the Goddess' blessings be<br/>upon you!")
('Manager Carlo', "Welcome to Orbal Café Iota! It's a pleasure seeing<br/>you again.")
('Manager Carlo', "Ilhan's been invited to the Financial Association's<br/>banquet being held today.")
('Manager Carlo', "People have been paying attention to him as an up<br/>and coming entrepreneur. I couldn't be happier.")
('Manager Carlo', "Hope he didn't forget that it's today, though. If we<br/>don't leave soon, we're gonna be late.")
('Manager Carlo', 'Ilhan is pretty flighty. In life, and with his<br/>responsibilities in particular.')
('Manager Carlo', "But we can't afford to let him miss this<br/>opportunity today. If he doesn't get it together, I'm<br/>gonna have to shake some sense into him myself.")
('Manager Carlo', "Ilhan's been thinking of setting up another startup<br/>out of nowhere.")
('Manager Carlo', "As if this place wasn't hard enough to manage...<br/>But I've been doing well enough, handling things<br/>by myself.")
('Manager Carlo', 'I just wish he had any idea how hard it really is.')
('Manager Carlo', "He's too easygoing. Sure, he has his occasional<br/>breakthroughs, but that's the extent of his genius.<br/>...Ugh, it annoys me just thinking about it.")
('Manager Carlo', 'We recently got into an argument about it...')
('Manager Carlo', "Yeah, he's really got a knack for this sort of deal, that<br/>I can't deny.")
('Manager Carlo', 'But I always just end up feeling like trash after<br/>the fact...')
('Manager Carlo', "I'm glad stuff around the city's finally started<br/>calming down. I'd be even more glad if customers<br/>started coming back, though.")
('Manager Carlo', "But the Revolution Festival is just around the corner.<br/>We'll be preparing for the festivities, of course.")
('Manager Carlo', 'Business has been booming over in the 3rd District<br/>lately. We need to pick it up with the ads if we<br/>want to get customers in here, too.')
('Manager Carlo', 'The whole village is just...gone.')
('Manager Carlo', "I'd heard of something like that being possible back<br/>when I was at the institute, but I never thought it was<br/>anything more than a theory...")
('Manager Carlo', "For something like this to ACTUALLY happen<br/>before our very eyes is just—no. I can't even be<br/>certain that's what happened.")
('Manager Carlo', "A-Anyway, I can't let this shake me up. I'm the boss<br/>around here, and taking care of the shop should be<br/>the only thing on my mind.")
('Manager Carlo', "It ain't easy to ignore these kinda things...but right<br/>now, I just have to do my job here.")
('Manager Carlo', 'Are you all here for Xipha adjustments? If you need<br/>anything, just ask.')
('Manager Carlo', "The department store's administrator, Wesley,<br/>came by today.")
('Manager Carlo', "He hit it off real well with Ilhan ever since they met,<br/>so he's been dropping by from time to time.")
('Manager Carlo', 'I think the two of them could become good friends,<br/>so I decided to keep my nose out of it...')
('Manager Carlo', "But Ilhan's good natured. And it leads to him getting<br/>taken advantage of. I should probably poke around,<br/>just a little.")
('Manager Carlo', 'You know, I got in touch with an old friend of mine<br/>from the Basel Institute of Science for the first time<br/>in a while.')
('Manager Carlo', 'It sounds like things are a bit of a mess over there<br/>right now.')
('Manager Carlo', "They haven't even decided when Xiphas will be<br/>available to the general public.")
('Manager Carlo', "Our Verne partnership was crucial to this store's<br/>success, so I'd like to get a sales plan going ASAP.")
('Manager Carlo', "Both Ilhan and I studied at the Basel Institute of<br/>Science, you see. We have a lot of connections from<br/>back then, and they've helped us a lot.")
('Manager Carlo', "Our Verne partnership was crucial to this store's<br/>success, so I'd like to get a sales plan going ASAP for<br/>the new civilian-Xiphas.")
('Manager Carlo', 'Wesley basically had to spit it out before Ilhan realized<br/>that what he was really here to do was spy on us.')
('Manager Carlo', "Yeah, he's the department store's administrator.<br/>From across the street. Probably wanted to steal some<br/>trade secrets, figure out why we're so popular.")
('Manager Carlo', 'Haha, what a sucker! He might be able to steal an<br/>idea or two, but our techniques will forever elude him!')
('Manager Carlo', "And that's 'cause there's no real technique! Most of<br/>the time, we just rely on Ilhan getting a sudden<br/>eureka moment. None of us know how that works!")
('Manager Carlo', "...Wait, saying it out loud doesn't make me feel<br/>any better...")
('Manager Carlo', 'We are always implementing new and<br/>innovative ideas...')
('Manager Carlo', "But they're mostly just whatever Ilhan's sudden new<br/>plans are. It's all so spur of the moment, I don't really<br/>get it.")
('Manager Carlo', 'He might be a genius, after all. Easygoing as he is.')
('Manager Carlo', "We get fewer customers when it's raining, so I'll have<br/>to figure out a new strategy to increase traffic.")
('Manager Carlo', "Strategies hinge on data, and it's hard to put one in<br/>effect when it's all inconsistent. We need to improve.")
('Manager Carlo', "Of course, it'd be way easier if Ilhan came up with<br/>REALISTIC policies, and not just pipe-dreams.")
('Manager Carlo', "Don't get me wrong, he's really smart and his business<br/>sense is fantastic, but there could be some<br/>improvement in this regard. Oh, a whole lot of it.")
('Manager Carlo', "Ilhan's an extremely smart guy, but he's totally<br/>clueless when it comes to managing a business<br/>up close.")
('Manager Carlo', "*sigh* Guess I'll just have to cover up for<br/>his weaknesses.")
('Manager Carlo', "He's here? Again?")
('Manager Carlo', "Oh, don't mind me. We just have somewhat of an<br/>unusual customer up on the second floor.")
('Manager Carlo', 'Is he trying to spy on us? I wonder what Ilhan will do<br/>about it.')
('Manager Carlo', "Hmm... He's been coming by all the time, but I can't<br/>just kick him out either.")
('Manager Carlo', "It could have a real effect on our business if he's out<br/>here, trying to get insider info.")
('Manager Carlo', 'Welcome to our shop! We deal in the latest in<br/>orbal technology!')
('Manager Carlo', 'I attended Basel Institute of Science, so I know my<br/>way around all our orbal products!')
('Manager Carlo', "But ever since I met Ilhan, I haven't had much time<br/>for orbal tech. My life's all business development<br/>and entrepreneurship.")
('Manager Carlo', '*cough* Anyway, our shop takes pride in providing<br/>our customers with the very best in both our products<br/>and support.')
('Manager Carlo', "I've been real close friends with Ilhan since we were<br/>in college. He's Iota's owner.")
('Manager Carlo', "He's just so nonchalant that he started playing at<br/>being a barista, despite actually owning the place.")
('Manager Carlo', 'Meanwhile, he left actually managing the shop to me.<br/>Geniuses really are crazy, huh?')
('Manager Carlo', "Ilhan's been starting up businesses since we were at<br/>the institute. The lucky son of a bitch has succeeded<br/>with most of them, too.")
('Manager Carlo', "I don't know how, when he has this devil-may-care<br/>attitude about EVERYTHING.")
('Manager Carlo', 'I wish he took things just a little bit more seriously,<br/>every now and then...')
('Manager Carlo', 'Oh, Mr. Arkride! I was just about to get in contact<br/>with you.')
('Van', "Hope it's 'cause you have good news for me.")
('Manager Carlo', 'I do. Your arts plugins arrived.')
('Agnès', 'Umm... A plugin?')
('Van', "Oh, yeah. You probably don't know what those are.")
('Van', "You know your Xipha's arts drivers, yeah?")
('Agnès', 'Yes. I have several arts set up in mine.')
('Van', 'Yeah. They still got some empty slots in them where<br/>you can put arts in.')
('Van', 'Those are custom slots.')
('Manager Carlo', "That's right! Plugins are what you use to set arts into<br/>custom slots.")
('Manager Carlo', 'Aaand here are the ones you ordered, Van.')
('System', 'Received a variety of plugins.')
('Manager Carlo', "Since you paid for those in advance, I can go straight<br/>to setting them for you, if you'd like.")
('Van', 'Be my guest.')
('System', 'Plugins can be set by selecting Set Plugin.')
('Agnès', "Oh, so that's how you set arts in.")
('Van', "Yeah. And you're only shellin' out for the<br/>plugin itself. Setting them costs nothing.")
('Van', "That's about as much as I can really teach you.<br/>The rest, you'll probably learn as you get used<br/>to them.")
('Manager Carlo', "That aside, I didn't realize she was also a Xipha user...")
('Van', "It's a long story.")
('Manager Carlo', "Our shop stocks both arts drivers and arts plugins.<br/>You're more than welcome to come by if you ever<br/>need either!")
('Agnès', 'Thank you. I will.')
('Manager Carlo', 'Xiphas are currently only available for military and<br/>bracer use.')
('Manager Carlo', 'Though there are plans in place to release a more<br/>civilian friendly custom model.')
('Manager Carlo', "I don't know the details about it, but it sounds like<br/>it'll be quite the leap in convenience for<br/>next-generation communication.")
('Manager Carlo', 'Our shop also stocks all the latest tuning devices.<br/>Feel free to ask about them if you like.')
('Ilhan', "*sigh* I can't think this much without some caffeine<br/>in me...")
('Ilhan', 'Ahh, no better companion for a nice brainstorming<br/>session than a good cup of joe. The best lesson<br/>Professor Cronkite ever gave me.')
('Ilhan', "But anyway. I'll take a short break and then start<br/>working on some countermeasures.")
('Ilhan', "There must be a limit to what devils can and can't do.<br/>That's what we should take advantage of to keep<br/>ourselves safe.")
('Ilhan', "I'm planning on cooperating with Marduk to help<br/>provide people with both food and shelter.")
('Ilhan', "Logically speaking, it doesn't make sense to think<br/>that time itself stopped.")
('Ilhan', 'But Professor Cronkite and I have been discussing<br/>the matter, and theorizing on it.')
('Ilhan', "If time really did stop, then the only way it'd make<br/>sense would be if we were somewhere where the<br/>laws of time don't apply in the first place...")
('Ilhan', "No, actually. The city's normal, but got swallowed up<br/>by this whole mess. If so, then the only way to fix this<br/>would be to... Hmm...")
('Ilhan', 'Uhh, my apologies. I was just thinking out loud...')
('Ilhan', "If normal laws and theories don't apply to this place,<br/>then the only way to fix this would be to... Hmm...")
('Ilhan', 'Happy Revolution Festival! To celebrate the<br/>occasion, all of our patrons today will get a free gift<br/>with their visit.')
('Ilhan', "I'm giving out one item to every customer.")
('Ilhan', "Let's see. What do I got here for you two? How<br/>about this?")
('System', 'Obtained 2 <br/>.')
('Van', "Thanks. This'll come in handy.")
('Ilhan', 'Sure it will. Be sure to come back to Orbal Café<br/>Iota soon!')
('Ilhan', "Haha, everyone in the city looks like they're having so<br/>much fun. Nothin' beats a good festival.")
('Ilhan', 'Now that I think about it, I feel like Carlo mentioned<br/>something important I had to do...')
('Ilhan', "Wasn't the Financial Association's Banquet<br/>today, actually? Ugh, I guess I'll start getting ready for<br/>that soon.")
('Ilhan', 'Carlo gave me a real earful yesterday when I<br/>suggested starting a new business.')
('Ilhan', "Told me it wasn't a coincidence this shop was as<br/>successful as it was. That it was the work of all<br/>employees here.")
('Ilhan', "And he's right about that. I've been focusing on the<br/>wrong things.")
('Ilhan', "That's not the kinda suggestion I can make on<br/>a whim.")
('Ilhan', 'Administrator Wesley has been working hard to<br/>come up with new ideas, too.')
('Ilhan', 'Haha, as if he could ever beat me.')
('Ilhan', "Iota's doing so well, it might even be time to start<br/>branching out to other stuff. Hmm...")
('Ilhan', 'I... I never thought something like this would<br/>ever happen.')
('Ilhan', "The former Institute of Science student in me can't<br/>help but have some ideas as to how this happened.")
('Ilhan', 'But I digress. Let me offer you a cup of coffee, to<br/>calm down the nerves.')
('Ilhan', "I've been wondering if there's anything I can do.")
('Ilhan', "But this isn't just some political or economic problem.<br/>Throwing mira at it won't solve a thing.")
('Ilhan', 'As of now, what I can do is offer my customers some<br/>form of respite, however small.')
('Ilhan', "Administrator Wesley's taken a real shine to<br/>Iota lately.")
('Ilhan', "I'm glad he's been moving things along. He's building<br/>a small terrace area on the rooftop.")
('Ilhan', "The person I look up to the most has to be<br/>Professor Hamilton. She's one of Epstein's<br/>three disciples.")
('Ilhan', "She's simply extraordinary. She kept an eye out for<br/>me where she could, back when I was studying in the<br/>Institute of Science.")
('Ilhan', 'I always get the impression that she sees things<br/>differently than we do.')
('Ilhan', "Now that she's resigned as a Verne advisor, she's<br/>gotten involved with geological research to aid the<br/>eastern parts of Zemuria.")
('Ilhan', 'Her demeanor was always majestic, and something all<br/>of my peers looked up to.')
('Ilhan', "Since we're both from the Central East, I felt<br/>some sort of...kinship with her.")
('Ilhan', 'I wanted to travel with her to the East, but she turned<br/>me down.')
('Ilhan', 'The most I could do to aid her was make a donation<br/>towards her research. The funds came from the<br/>earnings from my startup, of course.')
('Ilhan', "She's quite old at this point, but I hope she's been<br/>doing well.")
('Ilhan', "As it turns out, that new regular of ours was the<br/>administrator of the department store that's just across<br/>the street.")
('Ilhan', "Maybe this means that he's...")
('Ilhan', '...a big fan of Iota!')
('Ilhan', "Ahaha, that's quite flattering! I know Iota's a whole<br/>lot more than just me, but it's still an honor.")
('Ilhan', "Even though it's raining, it's surprisingly not very<br/>humid outside.")
('Ilhan', "On gloomy days like this, I recommend some<br/>strong coffee. It'll give your day just that extra kick<br/>that it needs.")
('Ilhan', "This doesn't work for everyone, but some people find<br/>it helps with headaches, too.")
('Ilhan', 'I use a slightly different blend on rainy days.')
('Ilhan', 'This old dude from earlier kept looking at me weird.')
('Ilhan', "I'm kinda suspicious of him. He kept scrutinizing<br/>basically everything in the café.")
('Ilhan', "Maybe this means that he's...")
('Ilhan', "...a big fan of Iota! Ahaha, I sure hope that's the case!")
('Ilhan', 'I decided to be a barista on a whim and have kinda<br/>just been winging it this whole time. I get<br/>self-conscious when people stare...')
('Ilhan', "I've been practicing so much I might even hold my<br/>own decently in a barista championship, but I still feel<br/>a little odd.")
('Ilhan', "Guy's here almost every day. Makes me feel a<br/>little sheepish.")
('Van', "Hey. You mind if we ask some questions? It's about<br/>the woman in this photo.")
('Agnès', 'We received a request from a young man asking us to<br/>look for his estranged sister, Jessica.')
('Agnès', 'We talked to Lucia about it. She directed us here.')
('Agnès', 'Do you happen to know where she might be living at<br/>the moment, or how we could get in contact<br/>with her?')
('Ilhan', 'Her brother? Did he give you this photo?')
('Feri', "If you know anything at all, please tell us! It'd be a<br/>big help!")
('Ilhan', "I'd love to help you, but, unfortunately, I don't know<br/>where she moved to. I'm really sorry.")
('Ilhan', "I wish I could've been of help.")
('Feri', 'Aww, seriously?!')
('Agnès', "(I don't think he's being completely honest with us.)")
('Agnès', "(He might know something else about Jessica that<br/>he's not telling us.)")
('Van', "Let's start from the bottom. I'm a spriggan. Not with<br/>the police or the guild, and I don't do things their<br/>way either.")
('Van', "We're pretty flexible, really.")
('Van', "So, if you're worried about her, why don't you tell us<br/>what's goin' on. It'll probably be easier in the<br/>long run.")
('Ilhan', 'So...you know, then?')
('Van', "Ain't got hard proof, but I got an idea.")
('Feri', "Umm, what's going on? I feel like I'm<br/>missing something...")
('Agnès', "I'm not completely sure, but I think I know what<br/>Van's getting at.")
('Agnès', "And if he's right, then we can't just keep<br/>ignoring this.")
('Agnès', "I know you have your reasons for what you're doing,<br/>but if you don't tell us what's going on, then we can't<br/>help Jessica.")
('Agnès', 'Would you be willing to trust us?')
('Ilhan', "That's...a good point.")
('Ilhan', 'Fine. I trust you.')
('Ilhan', "But I don't really have a right to talk about it. I think<br/>it's better you hear it from the horse's mouth.")
('Feri', 'What do you mean?')
('Ilhan', "I'll get in touch with Jessica and see if I can get you<br/>guys to meet up.")
('Ilhan', "You know what you're doing, so I leave the rest<br/>to you.")
('Van', 'Cool. No prob.')
('System', 'Ilhan got in contact with Jessica through his orbal<br/>terminal, arranging for her to meet the team at<br/>the café.')
('Ilhan', 'Jessica will be here very soon.')
('Ilhan', "I'll serve you some drinks, so you can just take a seat<br/>and wait.")
('Ilhan', "I'm leaving things in your hands.")
('Ilhan', 'I happened to hear from Jessica a little while ago.')
('Ilhan', 'Sounds like you managed to get everything settled<br/>without an issue. Thank you so much!')
('Ilhan', "I didn't really know what to think of you lot when<br/>you first approached me about it. In retrospect, I feel<br/>silly about doubting you.")
('Agnès', "Oh, don't worry about it. You had every right to<br/>doubt us.")
('Ilhan', 'Haha, yeah. I guess.')
('Ilhan', "Here's a little something for you. A token<br/>of gratitude.")
('System', 'Obtained 3 <br/>.')
('Feri', 'Ohh! Thank you SO much!')
('Van', 'Thanks. Appreciate it.')
('Ilhan', "I'm from the Central East, but I studied abroad at the<br/>Basel Institute of Science.")
('Ilhan', 'The institute was great. They had the best professors<br/>in the Republic, and I made a lot of friends there.')
('Ilhan', "I had a startup around that time. Unexpectedly, it was<br/>real successful! Got a good hunk o' cash from it.")
('Ilhan', 'With that, I set up this place. Man, how time flies.')
('Ilhan', 'Carlo and I actually go way back. We both studied at<br/>the institute.')
('Ilhan', "He's the one that actually runs this shop. Dunno what<br/>I'd do without him.")
('Ilhan', "If it weren't for him, I wouldn't have the time to be a<br/>simple barista.")
('Ilhan', "Here's your order: Our seasonal latte. Thank you, and<br/>be careful not to burn yourself!")
('Ilhan', "Hope you enjoy it, and do come back soon! I'd love to<br/>see you here as a regular.")
('Ilhan', 'Hey there. Welcome to Orbal Café Iota.')
('Ilhan', 'Did you get a chance to check out our first floor?<br/>We manage the orbal side of the café down there.')
('Ilhan', "And that's where our name came from!")
('Ilhan', "Haha, there's no deeper reason for the fusion. I just<br/>really liked both orbal tech and cafés!")
('Ilhan', "Just so you know, I'm this place's owner. Ilhan.<br/>It's nice to meet you. I would recommend our<br/>seasonal latte, if you'd like a drink.")
('Ilhan', "Oops, never mind! Looks like we're all sold out.<br/>Better luck next time!")
('Van', "Damn it! I was lookin' forward to seeing what all the<br/>talk was about. Keep hearing about how rich the milk<br/>you use is.")
('Agnès', "Oh, right.<br/>(I'd almost forgotten, but I guess this is Van's area<br/>of expertise.)")
('Ilhan', "There's a lot of buzz around our café as of late.<br/>It's featured in quite a few magazines as the trendiest<br/>spot in all of Edith.")
('Ilhan', "Haha, it's a little embarrassing. I was just trying to<br/>combine two of my favorite things.")
('Ilhan', "I've always dreamed of being a barista, and I'm lucky<br/>enough to be able to take it easy and do that.")
('Sylvie', 'Yeah, I know Thorndyke. Arrogant bastard.')
('Risette', "Then you've spoken to Mr. Thorndyke.")
('Sylvie', 'To my sheer displeasure. Bastard wanted to buy<br/>out Thunders.')
('Sylvie', "Said something about 'ensuring strength and<br/>operability in these unprecedented circumstances.'<br/>Kinda tuned him out.")
('Sylvie', "What a douchebag. According to him, things'll never<br/>go back to normal unless we cooperate.")
('Sylvie', "He thinks he has the upper hand just 'cause he knows<br/>something I don't, the jackass. Got some balls to play<br/>the double-faced card on me.")
('Van', "Yeah. He's the kinda man you wanna be careful with.<br/>But I can't imagine you, of all people, even listening<br/>to him.")
('Sylvie', "Nah, I did. Jerk's pretty convincing when he up and<br/>offers you three times the expected amount.")
('Risette', 'You took the deal?')
('Sylvie', "Don't worry, I ain't no sellout. Deal just applies to<br/>abnormal circumstances.")
('Sylvie', "Not a hundred percent sure what that will apply to,<br/>but if I'm gonna take a chance, I might as well do it<br/>with the one holding the cards.")
('Sylvie', "You better deal with this shit soon, or you'll be<br/>screwing me out of a lot of money!")
('Van', 'Hah. Keep our weapons tuned up, and we got a deal.')
('Sylvie', 'Those mafia jerks got us in a biiig mess.')
('Sylvie', "Gonna have to teach 'em a lesson, gunsmith style.")
('Sylvie', 'I signed a contract with Marduk, but nothing in it<br/>said it was an exclusive deal.')
('Sylvie', "Hurry up and do your tune-ups. Never know what<br/>might happen, and you don't wanna get caught with<br/>your pants down.")
('Sylvie', "Hey, gang. Not takin' a break for the festival?")
('Van', "Eh, we're just keepin' an eye out. Hope things stay<br/>this calm.")
('Agnès', 'Huh. Is Kaina not around?')
('Feri', "Where's Kaina? I don't see her anywhere.")
('Aaron', 'You keeping an eye on that artisan from Creil,<br/>I hope.')
('Risette', 'I wonder how the artisan from Creil Village has been<br/>doing as of late.')
('Quatre', 'I was under the impression an artisan from Creil was<br/>training here.')
('Judith', "Huh. Wasn't there a gunsmith from Creil here?")
('Bergard', "Hmm... I hope everything's all right with that<br/>gunsmith from Creil Village.")
('Sylvie', "She headed into town with Lashkar. Tryin' to lift his<br/>spirits and all that.")
('Sylvie', "She's putting on a strong face, but you can tell she's<br/>still shaken 'bout the whole deal.")
('Sylvie', "The least I could do for her is let her go out and enjoy<br/>the festival with her friend. She'll probably be back<br/>before dark.")
('Van', "Got'cha... Hope it helps.")
('Sylvie', "Don't worry so much about it. I'll keep an eye on her.")
('Sylvie', 'What she does after is up to her. All we can do is<br/>support and believe in her in the meantime.')
('Sylvie', "It's been quiet here because of the festival. I can<br/>manage it by myself.")
('Sylvie', "If you're lookin' to get something done, better let me<br/>know now.")
('Sylvie', 'And try to keep an eye out for Lashkar and Kaina.<br/>Just in case you bump into them, of course.')
('Sylvie', "If you're looking for Kaina, I sent her home early.<br/>She needs some time to herself.")
('Sylvie', "I know things will only get busier with the festival<br/>comin' up, but it's a much needed break.")
('Sylvie', "Right now's not the time to be worrying about<br/>other stuff.")
('Sylvie', "Much as I wanna know what's up with Almata's<br/>weapons poppin' up in the black market, plus<br/>whatever Marduk and Zecht Arms are up to.")
('Sylvie', "They're shady as all hell. I don't trust it.")
('Sylvie', "Verne's weapons portfolio has expanded massively<br/>over the past two years, and we got Reinford's<br/>contributions to thank for it.")
('Sylvie', "But that can't be all there is to it...")
('Sylvie', "They'll be unveiling the army's new weapons at the<br/>Revolution Festival.")
('Sylvie', "Don't worry about Kaina. I'll take care of her.")
('Sylvie', "I'll keep up with her training.")
('Sylvie', "She's my apprentice, after all, and I don't do things<br/>by halves.")
('Sylvie', "Never in my wildest dreams did I expect somethin'<br/>like that to happen to Kaina's hometown.")
('Sylvie', "I can't look away from this—not when I'm close with<br/>someone from Creil. I plan on lendin' a hand, too.")
('Sylvie', "Keep your eyes on the ball, spriggan! Can't be getting<br/>caught off guard like this all the time.")
('Sylvie', "Hey, Van... You know this kid, too, don't ya?")
('Sylvie', "The guys over at Stanley's introduced us, so I decided<br/>to take her up for some training.")
('Sylvie', "She's got potential. Been a while since I had an<br/>apprentice, so it's just a crash course for now.")
('Sylvie', "What do you need? I'm adjustin' Mr. Daswani's gun<br/>right now. If ya need something, spit it.")
('Sylvie', "He's real picky. Stuck to the same gun model since he<br/>joined the force.")
('Sylvie', "And he's very careful with maintenance.<br/>Honestly, you can gauge a lot about someone from<br/>how they care for their weapons.")
('Sylvie', 'I totally disassembled his gun. Top to<br/>bottom maintenance.')
('Sylvie', 'If you need anything, get in line. Still got some<br/>adjusting to do so I can bring the accuracy up<br/>to snuff.')
('Sylvie', 'The custom parts were made by yours truly, by<br/>the way. I make sure to customize each weapon to<br/>suit their owner perfectly.')
('Sylvie', "Huh. Not the most trustworthy bracer out there, but I<br/>guess it makes sense when he's still a junior bracer.")
('Sylvie', "Well, whatever. I get paid, I do the job. Has always<br/>been my way of handlin' things.")
('Sylvie', "Comparing him now to Zin and Elaine would be<br/>plain unfair, but who knows. Maybe he's actually<br/>made of some good stuff.")
('Sylvie', "For starters, he's got himself a good gun. Guess it<br/>won't hurt to nudge him the right way a little.")
('Sylvie', "I've been dealing with bracers for a looong time.<br/>He ain't got bad taste.")
('Sylvie', "He won't be measurin' up to Zin or Elaine anytime<br/>soon, but a little push here and there won't hurt.")
('Sylvie', "Gotta do what I gotta as a gunsmith. Not like I<br/>haven't been handlin' the army's weapons this<br/>whole time.")
('Sylvie', 'But the ones that come to me for adjustments are the<br/>real enthusiasts.')
('Sylvie', "The army pulled out all the stops in gettin' everyone<br/>kitted out with the latest and greatest, but not<br/>everyone was happy.")
('Sylvie', "Pleasing the displeased is my job, so I've been taking<br/>care of 'em.")
('Sylvie', "Hey, Van. You're familiar with Stanley's over in Old<br/>Town, yeah?")
('Sylvie', "We've been on good terms for a while. They recently<br/>got in touch with me, though. Said they wanted to<br/>introduce me to someone.")
('Sylvie', "A very promising young craftsman from<br/>the countryside. I suppose I'll be meetin' her<br/>sometime soon.")
('Sylvie', "Speaking of Desire, the boy from Newberry's a<br/>member, yeah? Eddy, I mean.")
('Sylvie', "I got no clue where you can find him, but might be<br/>worth chattin' him up.")
('Sylvie', "Arms manufacturers have been poppin' up pretty<br/>much outta nowhere the past few years. That includes<br/>Marduk and Zecht Arms.")
('Sylvie', 'With the army upgrading all their weaponry over the<br/>course of the past two years, this is a pretty exciting<br/>time to be in the arms industry.')
('Sylvie', "Rumor has it that Verne's subsidiaries are working on<br/>developing weapons that take advantage of Xipha<br/>technology, too.")
('Sylvie', "I'm just followin' in my granddad's footsteps, but even<br/>my interest is piqued with that.")
('Sylvie', "Well, that ain't somethin' you see every day.<br/>Girlie, you're a Kruga, yeah?")
('Feri', "Y-Yes! It's a long story, but I'm living in Edith now.")
('Sylvie', "Got'cha. You got something unusual on ya.")
('Sylvie', "Let me take a look at your weapon. That's a desert<br/>type rifleblade, no?")
('Feri', "It is! It's gotten some custom work done on it, so the<br/>center of mass has changed...")
('Sylvie', 'Wow, the machinery is so intricate! I always get so<br/>pumped looking at anything with a<br/>transformation gimmick.')
('Agnès', "(They look like they're having a lot of fun.)")
('Van', "(Guess that's just what girls are into nowadays.<br/>...I should keep that observation to myself.)")
('Sylvie', "I haven't seen a Kruga rifleblade in so long.<br/>Fascinating stuff.")
('Sylvie', "Sorry I couldn't help with your rifle.")
('Sylvie', "I'll try digging around, see what I come up with.<br/>Come by and say hi next time you get a chance.")
('Sylvie', 'People assume the Central East is old-fashioned,<br/>even in their weaponry.')
('Sylvie', "But that doesn't account for the wealthier places, like<br/>Elsaim and Valis.")
('Sylvie', 'They deck themselves out with all the<br/>latest equipment. Worth looking into, if you get<br/>the chance.')
('Sylvie', 'Hey, Van. Here to get some work done on... Huh?')
('Sylvie', "Who's the girl? One of your clients or somethin'?")
('Van', "She's actually my new assistant, believe it or not.")
('Agnès', "I-It's a pleasure to meet you!")
('Sylvie', "Hey, name's Sylvie. I'm the third generation in a<br/>family of gunsmiths.")
('Sylvie', "Gonna guess you'd never even known there was a<br/>shop like this in the department store.")
('Agnès', "No, I knew of it. I'm familiar with some people that<br/>enjoy hunting and competitive shooting.")
('Agnès', "But I guess this isn't the kind of shop I was expecting.<br/>It's very...proper.")
('Sylvie', "If you're gonna do something, gotta do it right.<br/>This place's the perfect spot. Got lots of military folks<br/>comin' by.")
('Sylvie', "I handle custom orders—modifying weaponry up to<br/>my customer's desired specs. Within reason,<br/>of course.")
('Van', "Your clientele's really gotta trust you to let you tinker<br/>with their weapons like that. Myself included.")
('Van', "Don't let the name of the shop trick ya. Sylvie here<br/>can modify just about any weapon.")
('Van', "You got some orbal staff parts lying around, don't ya?")
('Sylvie', 'An orbal staff user? Interesting.')
('Sylvie', "Nothin' out of my wheelhouse, of course. Long as<br/>there's mira on the table, I'm happy to do my job.")
('Agnès', 'I-I would really appreciate it.')
('Agnès', "That's all we had to do at the department store.")
('Van', "Yup. But don't let that stop ya if you wanna go take a<br/>look elsewhere.")
('System', 'The Connections tab on your To-Do List and<br/>Notebook has been unlocked.')
('Sylvie', "Van's weapon is a stun caliber. Not your run of the<br/>mill weapon.")
('Sylvie', "No sharp edges, so it's perfect for suppression.<br/>Easy to carry around, too.")
('Sylvie', "A tricky and unwieldy thing, if you ask me. And I<br/>ain't too fond of the developer, either.")
('Sylvie', 'But whatever. Not gonna judge your weapon<br/>of choice.')
('Sylvie', "Bring it over whenever you need me to tinker with it.<br/>That goes for ya, too, girlie. I'll be happy to handle<br/>that orbal staff of yours anytime.")
('Sylvie', "You're Kaina, yeah? From Creil Village. Heard you<br/>know something here and there about gunsmithing.")
('Kaina', 'W-Well, my boss said my metalworking is<br/>pretty good.')
('Kaina', "I'm no expert, of course, but...I take just as much<br/>pride in my work as my ancestors did!")
('Sylvie', "I heard about that. You took up gunsmithing by<br/>reading your family's old notes, yeah?")
('Sylvie', 'I feel you. I come from a long line of<br/>gunsmiths myself.')
('Sylvie', "Technology might change, but the real mettle needed<br/>to be a gunsmith hasn't.")
('Sylvie', "The road ain't easy, but I'm sure you know<br/>that already.")
('Kaina', "I-I do! Thank you so much for taking me in. I won't<br/>disappoint you!")
('Sylvie', "All right, all right. Don't freak out over it. But you<br/>got the spirit, and I appreciate that.")
('Sylvie', "But relax a little. We're the same age.")
('Kaina', 'W-We are?!')
('Agnès', "(That's Kaina from Creil Village. Looks like she's<br/>training here.)")
('Quatre', '(Thunders is a pretty well known place.)')
('Quatre', "(Although I wasn't aware the owner was so young.)")
('Van', "(Sylvie's been gettin' gunsmithing hammered in by<br/>her grandfather since she was young.)")
('Van', "(Yeah, she's only twenty, but she's the real deal.<br/>Anyone doin' an apprenticeship under her is in<br/>good hands.)")
('Sylvie', "Oh, it's you guys. Figured you'd be out and about.")
('Agnès', "Sylvie! And Kaina, too! You're from Creil, right?")
('Van', "Heard you were safe 'cause you were here in<br/>the capital.")
('Van', "Though you're not the only one. Some other villagers<br/>narrowly avoided bein' caught up in this shtick.")
('Van', "You've been trainin' with Sylvie here for<br/>gunsmithing, yeah?")
('Kaina', 'Yeah. I was gonna go back home for the harvest<br/>festival, but my car broke down. I was only planning<br/>on staying here one more day.')
('Kaina', 'And then...that happened.')
('Kaina', 'My gunsmithing training was supposed to be over<br/>after a week.')
('Kaina', 'I was gonna go back home for the harvest festival, but<br/>my car broke down. I was only planning on staying<br/>here one more day.')
('Kaina', 'And then...that happened.')
('Agnès', "It was so awful, I'm sorry.")
('Sylvie', "I've been swamped with public safety hearings<br/>and stuff.")
('Sylvie', "Things are calmin' down, but it's still a mess<br/>out there.")
('Sylvie', "But don't you worry about figurin' out a<br/>livin' situation. You can stay here with me for as long<br/>as you need.")
('Kaina', "Thank you, Sylvie. I don't know what I'd do if I<br/>didn't have you looking out for me.")
('Sylvie', "It's fine. You're my apprentice now, so this is as much<br/>my business as it is yours.")
('Sylvie', "Even with your family gone, you're not alone.<br/>You can rely on me from here on out.")
('Kaina', '*sniffle* Thank you!')
('Judith', "(I'm glad she has somewhere to stay at least, but that<br/>doesn't make the situation any less shitty.)")
('Judith', "(I'd shame the name Grimcat if I just sat idle and<br/>did nothing.)")
('Sylvie', 'Hey, Van. Gang. Heard you guys had a hand in all<br/>that Oración business.')
('Sylvie', "What a hodgepodge of evil organizations comin' out<br/>of the woodwork it was. Marduk, Zecht Arms...<br/>Just to name a few.")
('Van', "As long as it involves weapons, I can count on you to<br/>know what's goin' on. Saves me havin' to explain<br/>things, I guess.")
('Sylvie', "Yeah, I know what's up. The underworld should<br/>hopefully calm down a li'l with Almata out of<br/>the picture.")
('Sylvie', 'Good comeuppance to those asshats, for what they<br/>did to Kaina.')
('Agnès', 'How have you been since the incident, Kaina?')
('Kaina', "Honestly, I don't think it's even dawned on me yet.<br/>It's like my head's not caught up with the fact that<br/>everyone is just...gone.")
('Kaina', "I couldn't thank Sylvie enough for taking care of me.<br/>And I've been keeping busy working, so at least<br/>there's that.")
('Kaina', "I can't forget about the devastating tragedy that struck<br/>my village just yet, but...I guess I'm starting to heal, if<br/>only a little.")
('Sylvie', "No need to rush feelin' better, though. You've got<br/>time, and I'll take care of ya all throughout.")
('Sylvie', 'Hang in there. Both for yourself, and for that kid.')
('Kaina', "I will. Lashkar's still so shaken up about everything, I<br/>have to be there for him.")
('Kaina', "Even with the church taking care of him, I'm the only<br/>one that really knows what he's going through.")
('Agnès', "You're right. I wish things were better.")
('Van', "I'll be sure to keep the squirt in mind.")
('Kaina', 'We were finally starting to heal, and then Almata<br/>had to do this...')
('Kaina', "I-I can't believe it... But I have to pull myself together<br/>and help Sylvie. She'll be helping out with battle prep.")
('Kaina', "It's the least I can do. I'll have to play my part,<br/>however insignificant it is, so that we can get<br/>through this. Through them.")
('Kaina', "I've been checking up on Lashkar every day. He's still<br/>pretty out of it.")
('Kaina', "I can't blame him for it. He and Annie were so close,<br/>after all. The least I can do is offer him my support.")
('Kaina', 'Lashkar and I were here in Edith. We were going to<br/>head home, but this happened before we did.')
('Kaina', "*sniffle* I can't believe they're all gone... Mom, Dad,<br/>and everyone else... Just...gone.")
('Kaina', 'I-I need to pull myself together. For Sylvie, and<br/>for Lashkar.')
('Kaina', 'Ahh! I never thought Sylvie would take me in as<br/>her apprentice!')
('Kaina', "And we're the same age? Man, that feels like a joke.<br/>How is she so skilled already? I can't even hope<br/>to compare...")
('Kaina', "Get it together, Kaina! This is a<br/>wonderful opportunity! Training under one of the<br/>Republic's best gunsmiths!")
('Kaina', "Oooh, I think I'm getting excited all over again.<br/>This week, I'll be a sponge! A sponge that absorbs<br/>every single drop of knowledge!")
('Li-Lian', 'Nice to see you back in one piece. Not that I was<br/>expecting otherwise.')
('Van', "Li-Lian! Good to see y'all are safe over here.")
('Li-Lian', "Yup. Safe as can be. Got Marduk's people to thank<br/>for that. They're pretty capable, all things considered.")
('Li-Lian', "I climbed up on the rooftop and took a look<br/>out there. I'll say, we're definitely up against real<br/>devils in here.")
('Li-Lian', "Hmm... It's all so...peculiar. But as unusual as this<br/>may be, I almost feel like I've heard about something<br/>like this happening before.")
('Risette', 'Before?')
('Aaron', 'The hell are you talking about?')
('Li-Lian', "Eh, forget about it. Memory's a little hazy and<br/>couldn't say for certain.")
('Li-Lian', "Assuming I'm not just conked out at my place and<br/>having some whack ass dreams, we better start pulling<br/>it together and get things done.")
('Li-Lian', "Don't worry about us. I'm a trained member of the<br/>Gekka school, after all. Might be a little rusty, but<br/>it'll suffice.")
('Li-Lian', 'And if you need any medical supplies, just let<br/>me know.')
('Van', "Appreciate it. I'm glad knowin' we can count on you.")
('Li-Lian', "I get being shaken up still, but right now is when we<br/>have to pull ourselves together. Focus on what we can<br/>do about it, not what we can't.")
('Li-Lian', "Don't worry about us. And if you need any supplies,<br/>you know who to ask.")
('Li-Lian', "Take a look, take a look! From common medications<br/>to exotic remedies, we've got it all!")
('Li-Lian', "We've got a variety of items! From over the counter<br/>basics to wonderful cosmetics! We got you covered if<br/>you need any souvenirs, too!")
('Van', "Just the Tear Balm's fine for me.")
('Li-Lian', 'Coming right u—hold on! Van! At least spend a<br/>little more! All the festivities should loosen your<br/>pockets a little.')
('Li-Lian', 'Can offer you five Tearals here—no, what am<br/>I saying? Here, you can have the whole lot!')
('Van', "Look who's got the loose pockets. Awfully kind<br/>today, ain'tcha?")
('Agnès', "Haha. Everyone's probably in a good mood because<br/>of the Revolution Festival.")
('Feri', 'They should be happy more often! We come here all<br/>the time.')
('Aaron', "I probably would've kicked you out already if all you<br/>came for was a measly Tear Balm.")
('Risette', 'Heehee. Every store around town has been brimming<br/>with customers today, so I understand the mirth.')
('Quatre', "Today's the perfect time for clients to get<br/>carried away. It's easy to overspend when<br/>you're content.")
('Judith', 'Well, unlike SOMEONE, I actually could use<br/>some stuff. Maybe a beauty mask and a heating pack?<br/>My shoulders have been killing me!')
('Bergard', 'Heh. What really matters is seeing everyone in<br/>high spirits.')
('Li-Lian', "It's the Revolution Festival! If there's a time to be<br/>merry, it's now!")
('Li-Lian', "We have some specialty Eastern medicines in stock!<br/>Be quick, or they'll all fly away!")
('Li-Lian', "A lot has happened this year, but we're on the last<br/>stretch now.")
('Li-Lian', 'If the stars align, I might even open up my own<br/>business next year. And by stars I mean mira.')
('Van', "I get ya. Heard they're finally cutting off<br/>war reparations.")
('Li-Lian', "I'm worried it might lead to a recession. Cutting all<br/>that cash flow's gonna have some repercussions. It's as<br/>easy as just saying 'no.'")
('Li-Lian', "The pharmaceutical industry's been growing lately.<br/>Even Verne's getting in on it, with this new company<br/>of theirs that's just started.")
('Li-Lian', "Maybe I should snoop around a little. They're still not<br/>open to the public, so now might be as good a time<br/>as ever.")
('Van', "I wouldn't get my hopes up.")
('Li-Lian', "You're such a killjoy! Don't worry so much about me.<br/>I did my homework on this.")
('Li-Lian', "It's real profitable right now. You could invest your<br/>life's savings into helping me set this up and I promise<br/>you I wouldn't lose you a single mira.")
('Van', 'Yup. But no thanks.')
('Li-Lian', "Hello! It's nice seeing you all here. Busy as always, eh?")
('Li-Lian', 'Looks like our mafia troubles are pretty much all over,<br/>so we get to enjoy the festival fully from here on!')
('Van', "Don't think it's gonna be that easy. There's gonna be<br/>consequences for it.")
('Aaron', "I don't like it myself. Even Heiyue is getting in on<br/>the cleanup.")
('Li-Lian', 'Better that the big shots of the underworld do<br/>something useful than hinder everything.')
('Li-Lian', "I'll take Heiyue being a little shady a million times<br/>over any genuine threats going on.")
('Li-Lian', "Don't think I'm a big fan of Heiyue or anything, but<br/>I'd rather take this than them doing anything that<br/>might threaten us.")
('Li-Lian', "The Revolution Festival's right around the corner.<br/>Here's hoping things'll remain this calm for the rest<br/>of the year.")
('Li-Lian', 'Hey. Sorry you saw that.')
('Li-Lian', "Xiaoling's one fault is her temper. She's always running<br/>on a bit of a short fuse.")
('Li-Lian', "I worry one day it's gonna land her in a<br/>sticky situation.")
('Li-Lian', 'I received another letter from my younger sister.<br/>She lives in Langport.')
('Li-Lian', "All her whining almost masks how hard she's working<br/>at bettering herself as a bracer.")
('Van', "I think I know who you're talking about. Her name is<br/>Xiaoling, right?")
('Van', 'Her Gekka skills landed her a job as a bracer, if I<br/>remember correctly.')
('Li-Lian', "Yup, that's her. Always getting herself in hot water,<br/>but she's real sweet.")
('Li-Lian', "Sounds like she's been having beef with someone<br/>from Heiyue. Oh, I hope she doesn't get into a really<br/>dangerous situation.")
('Li-Lian', "If only she'd behave...")
('Li-Lian', "All I can do is hope. I'm honestly not on the best<br/>terms with my family, so I don't plan on going back<br/>anytime soon.")
('Agnès', '(Heehee. Li-Lian really cares about Xiaoling,<br/>despite everything.)')
('Van', "(Never thought I'd see this side to Li-Lian,<br/>considering his usual cynicism. Might be a<br/>bit much...)")
('Li-Lian', 'My parents are insisting I go back home ASAP.')
('Li-Lian', "But I'm not budging. If I go back, that'll just mean<br/>a leash. They'll take advantage of me and make me<br/>take over the dojo.")
('Li-Lian', "That stuff's not for me. I'd rather leave it to my<br/>younger sister. She's still a little clumsy, but she's a<br/>whole lot more reliable than I am.")
('Li-Lian', 'By the way, Van. Ever thought about investing in<br/>a business? To be specific, my business. You HAVE<br/>been taking a lot of requests.')
('Li-Lian', "You've gotta be loaded, right? What do you say to<br/>pumping a little cash into my business?")
('Van', 'As if. Not with all the part-timers I got.')
('Van', "Everyone but Agnès has rent to pay, and that<br/>ain't cheap. Gotta pay them all a livable wage.")
('Li-Lian', 'Ahaha! Look at you, acting like a boss. You could<br/>almost pass as a proper business!')
('Van', 'Shut it.')
('Van', "But speaking of dough, shouldn't YOU be the one<br/>that's rollin' in it, with that recent promotion you got?")
('Li-Lian', "Oh, no, not at all. I owe this pharmacy so much for<br/>all they've done for me. I asked them to keep my<br/>salary the same, in fact.")
('Li-Lian', 'But once I get my business up and running, THEN<br/>all the mira will come rolling in! ♪')
('Van', "You made the right choice quittin' martial arts.<br/>The shrewd business style suits you better.")
('Li-Lian', "What a fun day! It's not every day I get to see you<br/>behave like a proper boss, you know!")
('Li-Lian', "And do think on that business proposal I mentioned.<br/>You'll get a ten percent return on investment. ♪")
('Van', "You're such a sly little shit.")
('Li-Lian', 'Not just Langport, but Tharbad also got caught up in<br/>that mess a few weeks ago.')
('Li-Lian', "The media's been pretty mum about it, but I don't<br/>doubt A has something to do with it.")
('Van', "Talk's been gettin' around about it.")
('Van', "You hear anything about what's goin' on in Langport?")
('Li-Lian', 'Just hearsay, and nothing specific, but the elders<br/>might finally be getting serious.')
('Li-Lian', '*sigh* Not a whole lot an ordinary citizen like me can<br/>do other than pray things stay peaceful.')
('Van', "You ain't exactly my definition of 'ordinary citizen,'<br/>but all right. We'll keep an eye out.")
('Risette', 'That we will. As for now, how about we take the<br/>opportunity to restock on medical supplies?')
('Li-Lian', 'Heiyue might finally be pulling out all the stops.')
('Li-Lian', "A full-on confrontation between two of the<br/>underworld's big shots wouldn't be pretty...")
('Li-Lian', "I don't ask for much. Just wanna live in peace.")
('Li-Lian', "Laurel Pharmacy is the perfect place for all your<br/>everyday needs! We've got a wide selection<br/>of products.")
('Li-Lian', "From brand name drugs to Remiferian medicine and<br/>Eastern remedies, we've got it all! Even all-natural<br/>cosmetics from the Central East.")
('Li-Lian', "Working here has really expanded my horizons.<br/>It's an experience I never would have been able to<br/>have back in Langport.")
('Li-Lian', "I would've done just about anything as long as it<br/>didn't have to do with martial arts, but I feel<br/>so at home here!")
('Li-Lian', "There's so much to learn when it comes to pharma.<br/>Different cultures and countries all have their own<br/>applications of medicine.")
('Li-Lian', 'The more you learn, the bigger your world becomes.')
('Li-Lian', "It was just an excuse to leave Langport at first, but I<br/>think I'm actually digging this whole pharmacist deal.")
('Li-Lian', 'Hold on a sec...')
('Li-Lian', "Oh, shit! Look who walked in! It's the talk of<br/>the town! Er... As long as that town is Langport.")
('Aaron', 'Li-Lian?! What the hell, man? Since when are you<br/>in the capital?')
('Van', "I should've guessed you two'd know each other.")
('Li-Lian', 'Hell yeah! Aaron used to come by our dojo.')
('Li-Lian', "I packed my bags and left Langport as soon as I<br/>could, though, so it's not like we got to know each<br/>other that well.")
('Aaron', "I'd heard something about my old teacher's assistant<br/>ending up as a pharmacist of all things. Weird ass<br/>career change, if you ask me.")
('Li-Lian', "And I see your bite hasn't gotten any less sharp!")
('Li-Lian', "Way I see it, we should both stick together. Just a<br/>couple of Langport's outcasts. I hope I'll be counting<br/>on your patronage soon!")
('Aaron', 'Throw in a ten percent discount and I might<br/>consider it, you quack.')
('Van', "I don't think discount meds are the deal you think<br/>they are.")
('Li-Lian', "Heard the capital is now home to Langport's prodigy.")
('Li-Lian', "Also heard he's got this new job at Arkride<br/>Solutions, too. So, Van. How's Aaron doing?")
('Van', 'You caught on to that pretty quick. Wonder where<br/>you get your info from.')
('Li-Lian', 'Hah, nowhere special. My sister got in touch with me<br/>for the first time in a while.')
('Li-Lian', 'She told me about what happened over in Langport.<br/>A real tragedy.')
('Li-Lian', "I'm just happy that Aaron's doing fine.")
('Li-Lian', 'My sister told me all about what happened<br/>in Langport.')
('Li-Lian', "All in all, I'm just glad the worst case scenario didn't<br/>come to pass.")
('Li-Lian', 'Not even the police or the guild know exactly what<br/>happened, or why.')
('Li-Lian', "Eh, whatever. I'm not from Langport anymore.<br/>I should probably let go and stop poking my nose in<br/>where I'm not needed.")
('Li-Lian', 'Look who it is! Van, crew. Welcome!')
('Li-Lian', 'Nice seeing a new face around. You guys staying out<br/>of trouble?')
('Li-Lian', "Now, don't be getting into too many fights.<br/>Medicine can't fix everything.")
('Van', "I'm not a common thug, you know.")
('Van', "And I don't want any lip from a Gekka student.<br/>Y'all get beaten up black and blue for sport.")
('Feri', "Gekka's a famous Eastern martial arts school, right?")
('Agnès', "I think so. I've heard about it here and there. I take it<br/>you are a student?")
('Li-Lian', "FORMER Gekka student. It's a bit of a sore spot.")
('Li-Lian', "Everyone in my family's a practitioner. We were<br/>pretty notable back in Langport for that.")
('Li-Lian', "But it wasn't for me. That kind of environment is<br/>just stifling.")
('Li-Lian', "So I left! And that, you could say, is yours truly's<br/>tragic backstory.")
('Van', "And now you're living in the capital. Real big sob<br/>story there.")
('Van', "But I guess it's not that unusual. Same thing<br/>happened to a mutual acquaintance of ours.")
('Li-Lian', "Oh, you mean Shenli? I hope he's doing well.")
('Li-Lian', "I try to avoid contact with people from Langport, but<br/>every now and then I get curious as to what's been<br/>going on there.")
('Li-Lian', "Not like I miss it or anything. Living in the<br/>capital RULES! Nothing tying me down, so I'm free<br/>as a butterfly.")
('Li-Lian', "I do wonder about what's up with Langport.<br/>With them in charge, how could I not?")
('Li-Lian', "*sigh* I just hope my little sister's not being reckless.")
('Li-Lian', "Well, well. If it isn't my favorite spriggan!")
('Li-Lian', "And looking just as grumpy as ever! Haha, I don't<br/>think I have any medicine for that!")
('Van', "I didn't come here to get any lip from you.")
('Agnès', "Oh. You're aware of Van's work?")
('Li-Lian', "I don't know anything in detail, but yeah.")
('Li-Lian', "I'm from the Eastern Quarter, so I know my stuff.<br/>Hard to not be aware of the underworld when you<br/>come from a place like that.")
('Li-Lian', "But don't you worry! This is just an ordinary<br/>pharmacy that sells extremely ordinary products.")
('Van', "I see you've started stocking Eastern remedies. A little<br/>pricey, but they've got their uses.")
('Li-Lian', 'Still strapped for cash, huh? You poor thing...')
('Van', 'Watch your mouth.')
('Agnès', "(Heehee. It's fun coming with Van and seeing him<br/>interact with other people.)")
('Agnès', '(I learn a little more about him with every<br/>little interaction.)')
('Li-Lian', "This is just your run-of-the-mill pharmacy, and I'm<br/>just a normal employee.")
('Li-Lian', "But since I'm from the Eastern Quarter, I'm more<br/>familiar with more specialized stuff.")
('Li-Lian', "Whether it's bruises, cuts, or even internal issues, then<br/>I'm your guy!")
('Li-Lian', 'Xiaoling, my dearest sister! How have you been?')
('Li-Lian', "I can't believe it's been four years already. Good to<br/>know you've outgrown that baby face of yours and<br/>finally shaped up to be a fine woman!")
('Bracer Xiaoling', "Wish you'd outgrown your big mouth. I'm tempted to<br/>punch you right on it.")
('Bracer Xiaoling', "But hey. Credit where credit is due—doesn't look like<br/>you're half-assing this job.")
('Bracer Xiaoling', "Eh, that might be a bit unfair. You were always the<br/>better one at Gekka between us two, so I guess it's<br/>fair that you'll be taking over the dojo.")
('Li-Lian', "Aww, thanks! But don't worry about me<br/>half-assing things. The place is yours, after all.")
('Li-Lian', "I'm being serious when I say you're better suited for<br/>the role of master. Both skill-wise<br/>and personality-wise.")
('Bracer Xiaoling', 'M-Me?!')
('Li-Lian', 'I do feel bad about putting all that weight on your<br/>shoulders, though.')
('Li-Lian', "I don't want you getting into any trouble...")
('Bracer Xiaoling', "H-Hmph! I don't see why that's any of your business!")
('Bracer Xiaoling', "I'm just doing my job as both a bracer and a member<br/>of the Gekka school.")
('Li-Lian', '*sigh* I know... But please take care? Do it for me,<br/>at least.')
('Administrator Wesley', 'Thank you all so much for saving the<br/>department store. Or rather, all of Station Street.')
('Administrator Wesley', 'You, in addition to Marduk and all the professors<br/>deserve my utmost thanks, for trying so hard to<br/>illuminate such a dark path.')
('Administrator Wesley', 'Our entire staff wishes to support those endeavors,<br/>and I plan to guide them as their manager.')
('Administrator Wesley', "We'll show everyone what Weston Department Store<br/>can really do once we put our mind to it. Please don't<br/>hesitate to take advantage of our services!")
('Administrator Wesley', "The festival's finally here.")
('Administrator Wesley', 'Our efforts have paid off. Our clientele can finally<br/>rival that of the Trion Mall.')
('Administrator Wesley', "People have been really keen of our new<br/>rooftop space. It's the perfect spot to take a break<br/>from the crowds.")
('Administrator Wesley', "I do wish we'd been able to put up a larger variety of<br/>events for the festival.")
('Administrator Wesley', "It definitely would've helped with our appeal.<br/>Our real rival is the orbal café, after all.")
('Administrator Wesley', "It's when the crowds are at their highest that we can<br/>truly test our mettle. This will be a fair fight!")
('Administrator Wesley', "Hmm. I'll leave the interior design to someone<br/>more capable. I'll focus on deliveries, but those look<br/>like they're on track as well.")
('Administrator Wesley', 'Though... I think I have an idea to appeal to tourists.')
('Administrator Wesley', "I'll leave the smaller details to those closer to those<br/>running the events. Our main focus this time is<br/>garnering interest and making it enjoyable.")
('Administrator Wesley', "Everything's on track, thanks to everybody's efforts.<br/>I'm so proud of all the hard work everyone's put in.")
('Administrator Wesley', "It hasn't been an easy year, but that's the more reason<br/>to end it with a bang and make this Revolution<br/>Festival the best one yet.")
('Administrator Wesley', "It'd be wonderful if the festival went off without<br/>a hitch. It'd take some weight off of<br/>everyone's shoulders.")
('Administrator Wesley', "We're still working on the rooftop area. My hope for<br/>it is that it'll be a popular lounge area.")
('Administrator Wesley', "Ilhan might be a creative genius, but he's a little slow<br/>everywhere else.")
('Administrator Wesley', "But I shouldn't worry about him so much. We can't<br/>focus all our energy on the orbal café when there's<br/>also the Trion Mall.")
('Administrator Wesley', 'The mall in particular is our biggest threat. It might<br/>be worth asking Ilhan for advice on the matter.')
('Administrator Wesley', 'Our store is stocked up on all kinds of daily<br/>necessities that people might need during a state<br/>of emergency.')
('Administrator Wesley', "Though please avoid bulk purchases. It'll only help to<br/>raise unease. Treat this shopping trip just as<br/>any other.")
('Administrator Wesley', "We're committed to your customer experience.<br/>Anyone in our staff will be able to help in case you<br/>need assistance.")
('Administrator Wesley', "Everyone's really anxious over our recent state<br/>of emergency. It's not just our customers, but<br/>staff, too.")
('Administrator Wesley', 'My hope is that taking the initiative to make these<br/>announcements will help curb the chaos slightly, as<br/>well as maintain employee morale.')
('Administrator Wesley', 'I do wonder how Ilhan is holding up through all<br/>of this.')
('Administrator Wesley', 'Perhaps I should go and pay him a visit later today...')
('Administrator Wesley', "Hrm... He's incredibly gifted and perceptive when it<br/>comes to his business sense, but he's still young.<br/>And naïve.")
('Administrator Wesley', 'Now that I know him a little better, I feel somewhat<br/>bad about this rivalry. Maybe I had him pinned<br/>wrong all along.')
('Administrator Wesley', "I've come to find out his opinion matters a lot to me.<br/>Hearing him praise us was elating.")
('Administrator Wesley', "I've been workshopping a plan to put in place so we<br/>can compete with Orbal Café Iota. I can't back<br/>down now. Not this far in.")
('Administrator Wesley', "I laid it on a little thick, but I don't think he<br/>caught on. It's a little disappointing that he didn't...")
('Administrator Wesley', "Still, I'm glad I had a look. It was quite eye opening.<br/>It showed me just how close-minded I've been and<br/>where the orbal café's true strengths lie.")
('Administrator Wesley', "It's given me a lot to think about. It wasn't a lack of<br/>innovation, but rather my blind spots. The rooftop's<br/>been our biggest missed opportunity.")
('Administrator Wesley', "We've started with all the major renovations for the<br/>space, so it should be ready relatively soon.")
('Administrator Wesley', 'I plan on figuring out the most effective way to make<br/>use of it so we can rival Iota.')
('Administrator Wesley', 'The success of it will put all my managerial skills and<br/>years of experience to the test.')
('Administrator Wesley', "I just got back from the orbal café, and I'm simply<br/>baffled Ilhan hadn't caught on yet.")
('Administrator Wesley', "Did he think us so insignificant we weren't even on<br/>his radar?!")
('Administrator Wesley', "Ugh... Whether that's the case or not, he's the<br/>real deal. He's talented, and I'd have no lesser rival.")
('Administrator Wesley', 'Just visiting the orbal café has given me a clearer idea<br/>of what path our department store should soon take.')
('Administrator Wesley', 'I had a chance to see the owner up close.')
('Administrator Wesley', "He's...easygoing. The kind that will welcome anyone<br/>with a smile. Even if that someone is the head of<br/>the store right across the street.")
('Administrator Wesley', "He's totally within his right to do so, of course.<br/>Nothing says I can't frequent different stores. I was<br/>there in the capacity of a customer.")
('Administrator Wesley', "But he's a whole lot more laid back than I expected of<br/>someone of his creative genius. Maybe that's<br/>his secret?")
('Administrator Wesley', 'Hmm... The idea of combining a regular orbal store<br/>with a café is quite intriguing, but also fairly efficient<br/>when it comes to space.')
('Administrator Wesley', 'I see... It gives you the perfect excuse to relax and take<br/>your time while you browse orbal devices or finish<br/>signing a large contract.')
('Administrator Wesley', "I never would've thought about that myself.")
('Agnès', "(Hold on... Isn't he from the department store?)")
('Administrator Wesley', "Oh. I know you. You're a regular at my<br/>department store.")
('Administrator Wesley', "Don't get the wrong idea! I'm not here to relax—I'm<br/>here to gather intel! Covertly, of course.")
('Administrator Wesley', "I'm here to find out what makes this store so unique.<br/>I must broaden my horizons as the department store's<br/>administrator, and see what could work for us.")
('Van', '(We just poked and he basically spilled everything.)')
('Agnès', '(I think we just caught him off guard, haha.)')
('Administrator Wesley', "This place's owner is quite the young prodigy.")
('Administrator Wesley', 'But working as a barista must surely be a joke, right?<br/>Does he truly have so much time on his hands<br/>to spare?')
('Administrator Wesley', "Though maybe it's that casual approach that<br/>contributes to his success.")
('Administrator Wesley', 'I worry about losing our clientele to all of these<br/>recent startups.')
('Administrator Wesley', "We're not in hot water quite yet, but it wouldn't be<br/>smart if a business didn't look forward.")
('Administrator Wesley', "I've got my eye on the orbal café in particular. It just<br/>opened a few months ago.")
('Administrator Wesley', "I'll say, they've been doing a good job of attracting<br/>attention from both the media and customers alike.<br/>Maybe I should see what the hubbub is about.")
('Administrator Wesley', "We still try to innovate often, but the things that<br/>worked ten years ago don't seem to work quite as<br/>well nowadays...")
('Administrator Wesley', 'This is a historic department store, but we might be<br/>in sore need of an update.')
('Administrator Wesley', 'I could take some inspiration from how our new rival<br/>handles things... Hmm...')
('Administrator Wesley', "Hello, and welcome to Weston Department Store,<br/>where we take pride in being part of Edith's history.")
('Administrator Wesley', "We carry only the highest quality products handled by<br/>the greatest experts in their fields. It's our mission to<br/>better your shopping experience.")
('Administrator Wesley', "You're free to consult an expert if you need a<br/>recommendation, too. Feel free to take a look.")
('Administrator Wesley', 'Our competition grows stronger every day. Not just<br/>with the advent of mass production methods, but all<br/>new kinds of businesses.')
('Administrator Wesley', 'And many of our customers have been migrating to<br/>the new large-scale mall beneath Trion Tower.')
('Administrator Wesley', 'But our products, handled by experts in their craft,<br/>are all of undoubtedly higher quality. That is its<br/>own appeal.')
('Administrator Wesley', 'Our store also comes with a new terrace lounge<br/>situated on our roof.')
('Administrator Wesley', "It's just the perfect open space for our customers to<br/>take a break from shopping. Dare I say, just like you<br/>can do at Iota!")
('Ilhan', "Ahaha, is that right? That's great to hear!")
('Ilhan', "But that's a lot of big words you're throwing<br/>around there! I kinda just winged it when I was<br/>designing Iota.")
('Ilhan', "I'm happy it worked out for you, though!")
('Administrator Wesley', "E-Excuse me?! You...'winged it'?!")
('Ilhan', "Yeah. Though it's not like Carlo let me do<br/>just ANYTHING. We still had to adhere to all those<br/>infrastructure laws, so he tweaked some stuff.")
('Ilhan', "I'm looking forward to seeing you guys' new<br/>terrace lounge. I'll be sure to come by and take a look!")
('Administrator Wesley', "Y-Yeah? We'd be...pleased to have you.")
('Administrator Wesley', 'Feel free to visit whenever you like...')
('Ilhan', "I'm in the middle of the workshopping process for my<br/>new seasonal latte. I want to have it ready for the<br/>Revolution Festival.")
('Ilhan', 'Are you guys planning anything in particular for the<br/>festival at the department store?')
('Administrator Wesley', "Oh, absolutely! We'll be featuring a variety of both<br/>street performers and musicians on our<br/>rooftop lounge.")
('Administrator Wesley', "Or that was the plan... We actually only came up with<br/>it recently, so we haven't really planned it in<br/>much detail. It's a little embarrassing.")
('Administrator Wesley', "It's just something I'll have to shelf until the start of<br/>the new year.")
('Ilhan', 'An event venue sounds fantastic! Especially with how<br/>popular street performances have been lately!')
('Ilhan', 'You could also get something for the little kids, too,<br/>you know? A play area or some sort of ride, I think.')
('Ilhan', 'Families would love it!')
('Administrator Wesley', "I-I see. That may just be what I've been missing...")
('Administrator Wesley', 'A worthy rival will always keep you on your toes.<br/>Well done, Ilhan.')
('Ilhan', 'What? Rival? What are you talking about?')
('Administrator Wesley', "Er... Never mind. Don't worry about it.")
('Manager Deborah', "Our administrator is always willing to assist, and we'll<br/>do everything we can, too.")
('Manager Deborah', 'Emma being here is such a great help, especially with<br/>how crazy things are outside.')
('Manager Deborah', 'She provided us with plenty of foodstuffs, so help<br/>yourself if you need to!')
('Manager Deborah', 'Oh, hello everyone! Sorry, I was catching up with an<br/>old friend of mine and I guess I got carried away.')
('Manager Deborah', "Emma's a produce vendor from Ored. Her family's<br/>had a relationship with my farm since back before<br/>she took over the family business from her parents.")
('Manager Deborah', 'She comes and visits me here in the Republic every so<br/>often, even after I moved.')
('Manager Deborah', "What happened to Creil is a tragedy that will forever<br/>weigh on me. But we can't let that hold us<br/>back forever. We gotta live our lives for them, too.")
('Manager Deborah', "Food demands always skyrocket right before<br/>the festival. We're used to it now, though, so we'd<br/>always stock on additional supplies from Creil.")
('Manager Deborah', 'My friend being able to hook us up this time with<br/>produce from Ored has been a lifesaver.')
('Manager Deborah', 'I think she mentioned visiting for the Revolution<br/>Festival so that might be the perfect time to thank her<br/>for it.')
('Manager Deborah', "I'm happy that the culprits behind the Creil tragedy<br/>are out of the picture now and the state of emergency<br/>was lifted, but it won't bring them back.")
('Manager Deborah', "It's hard to accept that we'll never get another delivery<br/>from Creil.")
('Manager Deborah', "We'd usually order a huge amount of extra produce<br/>right before the festival.")
('Manager Deborah', "This will be the first year we won't. It's a painful<br/>reminder that they're really gone.")
('Manager Deborah', 'Not even in my wildest dreams would I imagine<br/>something like that happening to Creil.')
('Manager Deborah', "We've been partnering with the village for so long<br/>that I think it's taken me even longer to accept that<br/>they're just...not here anymore.")
('Manager Deborah', 'All of our suppliers were the loveliest of people.<br/>Why... Why did this have to happen?')
('Manager Deborah', "I've handled business with Creil before, as one of our<br/>produce suppliers. They were always so kind to me<br/>when I stopped on my way home, too...")
('Manager Deborah', "They didn't deserve this...")
('Manager Deborah', "Our rooftop terrace is finally open. It's part of<br/>Administrator Wesley's plan to compete with Iota.")
('Manager Deborah', "It's the perfect place for our customers to take a much<br/>needed shopping break, and we might even start<br/>holding events there soon.")
('Manager Deborah', "It's a little plain for now, but Administrator Wesley<br/>is making sure we'll be able to take full advantage<br/>of the space in the future.")
('Manager Deborah', "He's actually at Ilhan's right now, bragging about it.<br/>He finds it to be quite the accomplishment, hah.")
('Manager Deborah', "Ilhan didn't realize that Administrator Wesley was, well,<br/>the administrator for the store right across the street.")
('Manager Deborah', "Wesley's a great administrator, sure, but he could<br/>work a little on his people skills. Heh.")
('Manager Deborah', 'But I digress. Taking advantage of the unused<br/>rooftop area was a great idea.')
('Manager Deborah', "Even I didn't know about it! I've worked here for<br/>thirty years! THIRTY!")
('Manager Deborah', "We're currently stocking up on Ored's seasonal<br/>vegetables! Creil's produce is fantastic, but I'd love<br/>it if you gave our autumnal Ored produce a try.")
('Manager Deborah', "On a different note, I recently received a letter from<br/>my parents! It's been a while since they last wrote.")
('Manager Deborah', "And turns out I was worrying for nothing!<br/>They hadn't written because they'd gotten distracted<br/>with Ored's new movie theater.")
('Manager Deborah', "But it looks like things are going great at the farm.<br/>Honestly, I don't know where they get all that energy<br/>at that age.")
('Manager Deborah', "Ored's been changing a lot lately. I recently heard<br/>they got a movie theater and even a racetrack.")
('Manager Deborah', "I haven't visited Ored in a while, now that I have a<br/>family here, but maybe it's about time I plan a trip.")
('Manager Deborah', 'Can you believe Administrator Wesley is still over at<br/>the orbal café?')
('Manager Deborah', "He's been going there every day for the past week.<br/>He insists it's for research purposes, but I just think<br/>he likes it there.")
('Manager Deborah', "He's been struggling lately, doubting his managerial<br/>skills, so I'm sure the break will do him some good.")
('Manager Deborah', "That reminds me, I haven't been in touch with my<br/>family in a while. They live in Ored. I wonder how<br/>they're doing...")
('Manager Deborah', "I might've already mentioned it, but my family owns<br/>a farm. It's hard work, and my parents aren't getting<br/>any younger.")
('Manager Deborah', "I've been so busy lately that writing to them has just<br/>slipped my mind. I should probably change that, see<br/>how they're doing.")
('Manager Deborah', 'Some new imports from the Central East came in<br/>today, so be sure to take a look!')
('Manager Deborah', "When people think 'Central East,' they picture barren<br/>deserts, but they have some wonderful<br/>local specialties. Spices and fruits, to name a few.")
('Manager Deborah', "Elsaim's cocoa and coffee are really popular and widely<br/>renowned for their quality.")
('Manager Deborah', "People are slowly growing more familiar with Central<br/>Eastern spices as of late, and it's been great for<br/>implementing some variety in our cuisine.")
('Manager Deborah', "Administrator Wesley's been gone for a while...")
('Manager Deborah', "He said he was going to check up on another store,<br/>but he's not back yet. Hope he's doing well.")
('Manager Deborah', 'Competition between smaller businesses has been<br/>heating up lately. It surely weighs on his mind.')
('Manager Deborah', 'Maybe I should talk to Administrator Wesley about<br/>expanding our sales floor and our catalogue...<br/>Hmm...')
('Manager Deborah', "Relations with the Empire keep improving, little by<br/>little every day. We've had a lot of western product<br/>coming in as a result.")
('Manager Deborah', "It'd be wonderful to offer a wider variety of Central<br/>Eastern spices, but if we don't expand our catalogue,<br/>we'd have to remove something.")
('Manager Deborah', "Expanding would be the better idea. It's always nice,<br/>just having extra options.")
('Manager Deborah', "I might not look like it, but I actually come from a<br/>family of farmers. That's why I get so hung up on this<br/>stuff, you see.")
('Manager Deborah', "I wish we could focus on different vegetable varieties<br/>here, since they can be very different depending on<br/>species and where they're from.")
('Manager Deborah', 'Hello there! We just had a huge batch of produce<br/>come in from Creil this morning.')
('Manager Deborah', "We've also got produce from Crossbell and Ored, in<br/>case you're picky about where your food comes from.")
('Manager Deborah', "Only the highest quality produce makes it to our<br/>shelves, so I'm sure you'll be spoiled for choice—in a<br/>good way, of course!")
('Manager Deborah', "There's a lot of competition nowadays undercutting<br/>our prices, but I can't imagine we'll be losing our<br/>clientele to them anytime soon.")
('Manager Deborah', "We carefully curate only the highest quality<br/>produce—been doing so for YEARS. I'd guess that's<br/>what's earned us the trust of our customers.")
('Manager Deborah', 'Long time no talk, Emma. How are things over<br/>in Ored?')
('Manager Deborah', "I haven't had a chance to visit my parents lately.<br/>Maybe I'll get the chance for New Year's.")
('Emma', "Things are looking up! Even Ored's quite shaken over<br/>what happened here.")
('Emma', 'Being here for the Revolution Festival does help ease<br/>me a little.')
('Emma', "I'd like to take this opportunity to expand our market<br/>even more, and was hoping you'd be able to help<br/>with that.")
('Manager Deborah', "Of course you can count on me! There's no one I'd<br/>rather work with.")
('Emma', 'Thanks, Deborah!')
('Emma', "Oh, by the by. I was passing by your family's farm the<br/>other day.")
('Manager Deborah', 'Oh, no way! Ahaha!')
('Emma', 'This whole mess caught everyone by surprise.')
('Emma', "I guess we're lucky I'd just brought in a new<br/>produce haul. It should last us a while, at least.")
('Emma', "Deborah and I will be handling food reserves with the<br/>utmost care. We don't know how long it'll go on for,<br/>after all.")
('Emma', "Deborah's been living in the Republic for a<br/>while now. It does me good to see her family doing<br/>good whenever I visit. It's a lovely sight.")
('Emma', "Haha, not that my own family back in Ored isn't just<br/>as lovely, mind you.")
('Milty', 'That professor is working on the roof right now.')
('Milty', "I'd probably be more a hindrance than support if I<br/>was up there, so I'm staying down here and focusing<br/>on what I can do.")
('Milty', "I brought over some ice cream from my stand, so<br/>that'll hopefully help with our reserves.")
('Milty', 'People have really been enjoying our rooftop lately.<br/>The view of the festival is just amazing up there.')
('Milty', "Having space up on the rooftop will hopefully help<br/>in making the store feel less crowded, even when<br/>there's more people around.")
('Milty', 'Seeing people enjoying the place has made me feel<br/>great about taking on the job as manager of the<br/>rooftop terrace.')
('Milty', 'Administrator Wesley has been workshopping other<br/>ways to attract customers to the rooftop area during the<br/>festival, including new items and events.')
('Milty', "I'm still new here, but I hope I'll be able to get along<br/>with everyone. A good workplace environment leads<br/>to good work being done!")
('Milty', 'Fingers crossed this will be the first of many years<br/>working here. But no use worrying about the future!<br/>Gotta focus on the now!')
('Milty', 'Customers have finally started coming to the rooftop<br/>terrace now that things are finally quieting down.<br/>Our numbers are on the up and up.')
('Milty', "And I'm sure even more people will come over when<br/>the Revolution Festival rolls around!")
('Milty', 'I literally had just gotten this job when this incident<br/>suddenly happened.')
('Milty', "But it's not like people can just put their lives on<br/>hold entirely. They still need to come shopping<br/>for dailies.")
('Milty', "It's my job as the terrace's manager to offer everyone<br/>some respite from all the chaos going on now.")
('Milty', "Starting today, Weston Department Store's rooftop<br/>terrace is officially open!")
('Milty', "My name's Milty. I'm the new recruit in charge of<br/>managing the rooftop.")
('Milty', 'I ran a café at my old job. It was in a large shopping<br/>center that also doubled as an event venue, so I<br/>hope the experience will help here!')
('Milty', "There's a lot of room on the roof for holding events,<br/>not to mention the killer view. I hope we'll be able to<br/>pull something like that off soon!")
('Milty', 'It is my responsibility as manager to ensure our<br/>rooftop lounge is just the perfect hangout spot!')
('Milty', "I expect the place to become popular with children<br/>once we install some children's playsets and start<br/>holding events here.")
('Milty', "Nice to meet you! My name is Milty. I'll start<br/>working in the department store next week. I stopped<br/>by to finish making some arrangements.")
('Milty', 'Well, that was the plan, anyway. Looks like the boss<br/>is busy right now. Might have to do some window<br/>shopping to kill time.')
('Neumann', "We'd been waiting for the Revolution Festival to<br/>come around for so long, and now this had to happen.")
('Neumann', "But we can't be lounging around dumbfounded<br/>forever. Administrator Wesley's decided we have<br/>to help.")
('Neumann', "You must be sure you're wearing the<br/>appropriate clothes. Especially if you don't know<br/>exactly what you're getting into.")
('Neumann', 'Do let me know if you need anything.')
('Neumann', "After everything that's happened, we should be<br/>thankful we get to celebrate the Revolution Festival<br/>in peace.")
('Neumann', "Now's the time to be festive. Are you interested in a<br/>particularly festive attire?")
('Neumann', "If you'd like to take this opportunity to kit yourself<br/>with a new ensemble, you're at the right place.")
('Neumann', "Everyone's seeking new vestments for the upcoming<br/>Revolution Festival. It's nice seeing an every year<br/>occurrence still present—tensions are easing.")
('Neumann', "I've thought about running a promotional campaign<br/>for Oración designer clothing this winter.")
('Neumann', 'No one from the fashion industry got arrested,<br/>thankfully, but stock prices in Oración have been<br/>plummeting regardless due to everything.')
('Neumann', "I'd be delighted in lending my own support to our<br/>partners in the clothing industry to help rectify the<br/>public's opinion.")
('Neumann', "It's a relief to see the emergency state lifted.<br/>Though things are calming down, we must keep ever<br/>present the lives we lost—they won't come back.")
('Neumann', "Who would've guessed that some of Oración's<br/>leading companies would've held ties to the mafia?<br/>Quite the surprise coming from ETWS and Quincy.")
('Neumann', 'We do business with some high-end clothing<br/>suppliers in Oración. I worried for a moment that<br/>there might be arrests among them as well.')
('Neumann', 'Fortunately, none of our partners or clients have been<br/>shown to have ties with the mafia. It was such a relief<br/>to hear.')
('Neumann', 'For such a tragedy to strike right on the cusp of both<br/>the Revolution Festival and the EGC...')
('Neumann', 'I can hardly imagine anyone would be in the<br/>headspace for clothes shopping when a state of<br/>emergency has been issued.')
('Neumann', 'Regardless, our department store will endeavor to<br/>support everyone during these trying times.')
('Neumann', 'I...should probably start that process by quitting<br/>my whining.')
('Neumann', "A massive shipment of winter and designer clothes<br/>recently arrived at our store. They're expected to be in<br/>fashion this coming year.")
('Neumann', 'The change in season is the perfect time to update<br/>your wardrobe. Not to mention the upcoming EGC.')
('Neumann', "People are opting to update their wardrobes right<br/>now, before both the EGC and the Revolution<br/>Festival. It's quite the opportune time to do so.")
('Neumann', "Most profits in the Republic's clothing industry are<br/>generated around November.")
('Neumann', "That reminds me. Administrator Wesley's recently<br/>put some new plans of his into effect.")
('Neumann', "I'm slow on the uptake where fashion's not<br/>concerned, so I only found out recently. It's nice<br/>seeing the store as a whole keep up with the times.")
('Neumann', "I'll trust Administrator Wesley's judgment in this situation,<br/>and perhaps I should follow his lead.")
('Neumann', "We've been very slowly rolling out our winter stock.<br/>Synthetic coats appear to be the most desirable<br/>fashion item this year and season.")
('Neumann', "The manufacturing of synthetic items, including<br/>fabrics, has affected the clothing industry lately. It's a<br/>recent development by Verne.")
('Neumann', "Though their research is much more in-depth than<br/>trying to replace natural fibers. They're looking into<br/>the benefits of combining both.")
('Neumann', "I'm rather intrigued to find out what will be the<br/>theme for this year's EGC.")
('Neumann', "All eyes are on the show, so it's the biggest trend<br/>setter in the fashion world.")
('Neumann', 'Actors from the Film Festival and general celebrities<br/>always dress differently every year, and the new styles<br/>always make an impact.')
('Neumann', 'How bothersome... Counterfeit designer goods have<br/>been resurfacing in the market as of late.')
('Neumann', 'They have always been quite the hassle to deal with.')
('Neumann', 'They recently started resorting to tactics like slight<br/>alteration to logos. It definitely lands them in a more<br/>gray area.')
('Neumann', "They can't claim to be complete copies, but their<br/>mere existence can affect the sales and reputation of<br/>the genuine articles.")
('Neumann', 'On top of the capital, Tharbad and Langport have<br/>been facing challenges regarding these<br/>counterfeit items.')
('Neumann', "I don't think it's related with the counterfeit designer<br/>goods issues that were had abroad, at least.")
('Neumann', 'But I still would rather not see these sorts of items<br/>become commonplace.')
('Neumann', 'Fashion culture varies wildly depending on location,<br/>even here in the capital.')
('Neumann', "Tyrell's a hotbed for youth fashion, for example.")
('Neumann', 'All while the Seiden District houses plenty<br/>of boutiques. Those tend to stock independent<br/>brands, making their fashion style very unique.')
('Neumann', "Our store's strong suit is being able to offer our<br/>customers a wide variety of clothing styles from<br/>different regions, all in one place.")
('Neumann', "Langport's fashion culture is shaped by its Eastern<br/>roots, while Tharbad's in turn is shaped by the<br/>Central East heritage in the region.")
('Neumann', 'Oración, to the north, is still quite traditional<br/>regarding old kingdom customs, and it definitely<br/>shows in what people there wear.')
('Neumann', "And while Oración is definitely the biggest hub for<br/>traditionalist fashion, it by no means doesn't have an<br/>influence in the capital, too.")
('Neumann', "There's quite a few established brands in Oración that<br/>offer traditional formalwear for formal occasions.")
('Neumann', 'Welcome to Jardin Boutique.')
('Neumann', "We carry a wide array of clothing styles in our<br/>boutique that aim to cater to all of our customer's<br/>unique tastes.")
('Neumann', "Whether it's the elderly or our younger clients, we<br/>carry something for everyone.")
('Neumann', 'Please, take your time looking around.')
('Agnès', 'We will! Thank you so much.')
('Agnès', "I can attest to this shop's selection. I've come here<br/>myself on occasion.")
('Agnès', 'Have you ever visited this shop, Van?')
('Van', 'Eh, I guess. Here and there. Mostly for the<br/>accessories they stock, more than the clothes.')
('Agnès', 'Heehee, I see.')
('System', 'The Connections tab on your To-Do List and<br/>Notebook has been unlocked.')
('Neumann', "Yimai said he was heading to the repair shop.<br/>I'd recommend paying it a visit if you're still looking<br/>for him.")
('Neumann', "That was about twenty minutes ago. You're likely to<br/>catch him if you hurry there.")
('Van', "(He's probably referring to the repair shop in<br/>Old Town.)")
('Van', '(We should head there and try to catch the<br/>old geezer.)')
('Neumann', "Everything we just talked about aside, that customer<br/>right there's been staring very intently at me this<br/>whole time.")
('Neumann', "I'd be more than happy to give them a clothing<br/>recommendation, but all their staring has me<br/>somewhat intimidated, haha...")
('Marguerite', "If there's something I can hope for, at least, is that<br/>Beth will change her way of thinking after<br/>this situation.")
('Marguerite', "But for now, our focus should be survival right now.<br/>I wonder if my hubby's okay...")
('Marguerite', "I try helping out the store as much as possible,<br/>considering I'm a regular here.")
('Marguerite', 'The festival this year has been so vibrant and cheery<br/>you could hardly believe what preceded us.')
('Marguerite', 'Well, I got our dinner reservations done so now I can<br/>focus on our side dishes for the upcoming days.')
('Marguerite', 'I imagine my husband will come home exhausted.<br/>Perfect time for me to pamper him a little!')
('Marguerite', 'As long as no horrible catastrophe falls upon us, my<br/>hubby and I will be spending the new year together!')
('Marguerite', "Beth ended up deciding she'd boyfriend hunt during<br/>the Revolution Festival.")
('Marguerite', "While I know she's desperate, I don't think she'll get<br/>anywhere by acting like this.")
('Marguerite', "Oh, well. Make your mistakes while you're young,<br/>I'd say. All I can do is be a shoulder to cry on when it<br/>inevitably goes wrong.")
('Marguerite', "*sigh* I did get the impression something was wrong<br/>with Beth, but I guess now everything's come back to<br/>bite her.")
('Marguerite', "Complacency's a killer. If she expects everything to<br/>fall into her lap, she'll miss out on the wonderful<br/>things she COULD be doing at the festival.")
('Marguerite', "Though she's still young. The most I can do is keep<br/>an eye on her and hope she'll eventually come to<br/>her senses.")
('Marguerite', "Phew. Thank the Goddess my husband is fine.<br/>I'm relieved to hear he'll be making it home the night<br/>of the Revolution Festival.")
('Marguerite', "I would've preferred that he come here before then,<br/>but he's been busy with his work trip...")
('Marguerite', 'Oh, well. The evening paints itself as the perfect time<br/>to have a fancy dinner.')
('Marguerite', "Beth's been really hopeful she'll snag a guy during the<br/>Revolution Festival.")
('Marguerite', "Of course I can see you meeting the one at the<br/>festival—that's where I met my hubby.")
('Marguerite', "But when your mind is clouded so badly by that<br/>prospect, you'll end up missing out on the best things<br/>in life.")
('Marguerite', "Ah... I wonder if my husband's okay? If I remember<br/>correctly, his trip was supposed to take him to Ored.")
('Marguerite', "Creil is on the way there... I mean, it's not as<br/>though he was supposed to stop in Creil, but...")
('Marguerite', "No, I'm sure he's fine... But! What if the route up<br/>to Ored is blocked now and he's stuck! Oh, oooh...<br/>I need to get in touch with him ASAP!")
('Marguerite', "Ugh. I didn't want it to sound like I was bragging<br/>about my husband, but I couldn't help just blabbing<br/>on about him.")
('Marguerite', "Though if you ask me about my relationship with<br/>him, of course I'll talk about his virtues. It's the most<br/>important part of it all.")
('Marguerite', 'I just wish Beth understood that.')
('Marguerite', "Beth and I have had a few teatime chats as of late.<br/>I'd say we've grown quite close since.")
('Marguerite', "Even though she's young enough she could be my<br/>daughter, conversation's never boring. We have so<br/>much in common.")
('Marguerite', "Though I don't think she listens to me when she asks<br/>for advice in finding a husband.")
('Marguerite', "She's not the kind of person I expected to attract the<br/>attention of while out shopping.")
('Marguerite', "But she's a great conversationalist, and her taste in<br/>fashion is impeccable!")
('Marguerite', "I think we'd get along, so I'll give it a try.")
('Marguerite', "*sigh* My hubby won't be coming home quite yet.<br/>It's been boring, not having him to talk to.")
('Marguerite', "I know some wives like indulging themselves in secret<br/>while their husbands are away, but I don't know.")
('Marguerite', "I don't see a reason why I'd have to hide from him.<br/>He's always been so generous with me, after all.<br/>And it's not like I'm doing anything wrong.")
('Marguerite', "Though he's so sweet and kind I can imagine some<br/>sly woman trying to take advantage of him while<br/>he's away!")
('Marguerite', 'I really appreciate my husband allowing me to<br/>overextend myself a little and indulge here and there.<br/>He always notices when I do, too.')
('Marguerite', "He'll note when I use high-quality ingredients in my<br/>food, and commends me quite often on the variety.")
('Marguerite', "Not to mention he never fails to mention when I'm<br/>wearing designer clothes and will compliment even<br/>the smallest things.")
('Marguerite', "I don't indulge for HIM to notice, but it does<br/>feel nice!")
('Marguerite', "Hmm. Maybe I should look for something to treat<br/>my hubby with, considering he's not been home in<br/>so long.")
('Marguerite', "Since I'm already here, I'll go to the second floor and<br/>take a look at the neckties, I'm sure he'd love to have<br/>some new ones. ♪")
('Marguerite', "...Not that I'm looking forward to him coming home<br/>or anything!")
('Marguerite', "But I can't have my husband leave me either.<br/>I couldn't afford this life of luxury without<br/>his money...")
('Marguerite', "Aaand I overspent again. Sure couldn't do that<br/>without my husband's salary.")
('Marguerite', "My life would be a whole lot different if I'd chosen a<br/>different man. Instead, I bagged myself a rising star in<br/>a top-tier firm!")
('Marguerite', 'I should be grateful for his generosity!')
('Marguerite', "There's always a bit of everything in this<br/>department store.")
('Marguerite', 'Not just everyday consumables, but a wide range of<br/>luxury goods, too.')
('Marguerite', 'And with how kind both staff and management are, a<br/>whole day goes by in the blink of an eye!')
('Marguerite', "Now, after my hard work sorting out all side dishes<br/>for the next few days, I think I'll reward myself with<br/>some afternoon tea. It's been a while.")
('Marguerite', 'No afternoon tea is complete without Quincy<br/>Bell cookies.')
('Marguerite', 'How convenient is it that this department store also<br/>stocks Quincy sweets! Now, what to pick, what<br/>to pick? ♪')
('Marguerite', "Tips for finding a rich husband? I...don't think I can<br/>give you tips on that...")
('Beth', 'Pleasepleaseplease, Marguerite! I crave a life of<br/>comfort and luxury just like yours!')
('Beth', 'All I need is a good and dependable husband with a<br/>juicy salary.')
('Marguerite', 'Yes, I get that part...')
('Marguerite', "...Maybe let's start easy. How about I tell you how<br/>I met my husband?")
('Marguerite', "You'd think my husband's good nature and kindness<br/>would make him gullible, but you'd be surprised.")
('Marguerite', 'I learned while on our honeymoon just how<br/>dependable and reliable he can really be.')
('Marguerite', "It's not just about how deep his pockets are at the end<br/>of the day.")
('Beth', 'Umm, Marguerite? You got...kinda sappy all of<br/>a sudden.')
('Beth', 'What happened to talking about how to bag a<br/>rich husband?')
('Marguerite', 'O-Oh, sorry. I got carried away there...')
('Marguerite', 'Right, right. I was talking about how I met<br/>my husband. It was during the Revolution Festival...')
('Beth', "(Marguerite's very different than what I thought<br/>she'd be. Her stories are still interesting, don't get<br/>me wrong! Just...different.)")
('Marguerite', "My husband said he'd be home late tonight, but he<br/>sent me just the sweetest letter, and—")
('Beth', 'Hey, Marguerite, I got this vibe from you earlier, but<br/>I was wondering...')
('Beth', "You don't actually...LIKE your husband, do you?")
('Marguerite', 'H-Huh? What kind of question is that?!')
('Marguerite', "Is it that hard to imagine I'd love my husband for his<br/>thoughtfulness and kindness, and not just for his<br/>deep pockets?")
('Beth', "B-But here I thought you were totally a gold digger!<br/>That you were only in it with him because he's<br/>crazy rich!")
('Beth', "Well, that explains why listening to you talk about<br/>your relationship wasn't, like, clicking at ALL.")
('Marguerite', "You're being awfully rude, Beth.")
('Marguerite', "I'm not exactly thrilled to hear that that's what you<br/>thought of me...")
('Marguerite', 'But that aside, do you really think that any<br/>relationship you ever involve yourself in will work out<br/>with that attitude of yours?')
('Beth', "I-I'm sorry?")
('Marguerite', "Maybe I'm being a tad too blunt, but the way you're<br/>acting shows absolutely no respect for your<br/>prospective partner at all.")
('Marguerite', 'No man, rich or not, will want a lasting relationship<br/>with you when you treat them that way.')
('Marguerite', 'Except for some lowlife looking to take advantage of<br/>YOU, instead.')
('Beth', "N-No! But gold digging is my life's mission!<br/>What else am I supposed to do?!")
('Beth', "Ugh... It's bad enough that I can't get any quality men<br/>to pay any attention to me...")
('Beth', 'Why is my life such a struggle? And my Revolution<br/>Festival plans went down the drain... Just my luck.<br/>*sniffle*')
('Marguerite', "Might be a good chance for you to take a lesson<br/>to heart. The world doesn't work like that.")
('Marguerite', "Everyone's priorities lie elsewhere right now, and,<br/>honestly, so should yours. We'll talk more about it<br/>once things have settled.")
('Beth', 'B-But Marguerite...')
('Marguerite', "Your attitude might not be the only thing that needs<br/>some fixing. You've got to do something about your<br/>face, dear.")
('Marguerite', 'You look more like a disco ball than a woman with<br/>that much glitter on you. No decent man will<br/>approach you when your face looks like a headlight.')
('Beth', 'M-Marguerite, thank you. You always help me out,<br/>even at a time like this.')
('Beth', "I-It's because you're so kind that you get to live a<br/>happy life with a rich husband...")
('Beth', "Meanwhile, I'm... I'm...")
('Marguerite', "Why don't you start by wiping away those tears?<br/>And you may as well wash off your makeup at the<br/>same time. Two birds with one stone!")
('Beth', "Heehee. I didn't get that many new clothes, but I<br/>definitely went all out with makeup!")
('Beth', "I'm going to look much more sparkly than usual!<br/>People won't be able to tear their eyes away with<br/>these party vibes I'm giving off!")
('Beth', "If an eager rich businessman approaches me, I'm so<br/>NOT letting him slip from my grasp!")
('Beth', 'I should be able to make use of some of the advice<br/>Marguerite gave me!')
('Beth', "Like how elite men go weak at the knees for women<br/>who they think 'get' them.")
('Beth', "Screw accessorizing. Makeup is where I'm bringing<br/>my A-game!")
('Beth', "Men can't help but be drawn to shiny things!<br/>The shinier, the better! I'll be a man magnet today!")
('Beth', 'Ugh. Here I thought Marguerite and I were<br/>kindred spirits.')
('Beth', 'But whatever! Who cares about what she says?!<br/>The Revolution Festival is just around the corner!<br/>This will be my big chance!')
('Beth', 'This is it! The final battle! I gotta keep going!')
('Beth', "The Revolution Festival is finally here! The day when<br/>all the capital's best catches have their guard down!")
('Beth', "There's no way that I'm going to miss this<br/>opportunity to find myself a loaded husband!")
('Beth', "I dolled up as best as my budget allowed. Watch out,<br/>'cause today I'm on the hunt, and my prey is a good,<br/>stable husband with deep pockets!")
('Beth', 'Marguerite was really worried over her husband.')
('Beth', 'I feel like I totally read her wrong.')
('Beth', "(I already heard everything she could share about a<br/>happy and healthy marriage. And there's nothing<br/>healthier in a marriage than a healthy wallet!)")
('Beth', '(Next step is to ask her how to pounce! The final<br/>frontier of netting myself a rich husband of my own!)')
('Beth', 'Huh? Did Marguerite go home already?')
('Beth', 'Here I was hoping to ask her for some more hot tips<br/>on finding a hot man with an even hotter<br/>bank account.')
('Beth', "Oh, well. I see her here at the department store all<br/>the time, so it's not like I can't ask next time.")
('Beth', 'According to Marguerite, looking good is the first<br/>step to netting yourself a wealthy man!')
('Beth', "It's vital that they view you as a suitable match, or<br/>something like that...")
('Beth', "It'll be a little tough on my wallet, but let's see it as an<br/>investment in my future! Once I get married, I won't<br/>have to worry about my spending!")
('Beth', 'Aww, man. I wonder what Marguerite did to snag<br/>herself a husband that wealthy?')
('Beth', "Once I find out, I'm sure I'll get to live in the lap of<br/>luxury too!")
('Beth', 'Now that I think about it, I heard that old lady I see<br/>here all the time has a really loaded husband.')
('Beth', "Maybe she's willing to share her knowledge with me?!")
('Beth', 'That way I can also get married to a rich man!')
('Beth', 'They got new bags and cardigans in stock.')
('Beth', 'But, ugh... My part-time wages can only cover one<br/>of them. Or two...')
('Beth', "New items keep coming out and I barely have the<br/>money to buy any of them. It's so frustrating...")
('Beth', "Someone pinch me! There's no way those are<br/>Pintilie bags! Man, I'm gonna drool...")
('Beth', "Wait, I AM drooling! The heck... At least it didn't<br/>get on anything.")
('Beth', "And those shoes are to die for... Man, I need to hurry<br/>up and find a husband that'll just hand me a big wad<br/>of mira and tell me to go nuts.")
('Marduk Security Guard', 'Thank you for helping get things under control in<br/>this district.')
('Marduk Security Guard', "We'll continue to stand by and protect the<br/>nearby residence.")
('Marduk Security Guard', "We're a little short on people, so we need to be smart<br/>about this.")
('Marduk Security Guard', "This department store will be our temporary base.<br/>We can both protect everyone and gather information<br/>while we're here.")
('Marduk Security Guard', 'Now that Mr. Thorndyke is back, a defense regime is<br/>also being assembled.')
('Marduk Security Guard', 'That aside... How exactly are we supposed to get rid<br/>of the source of the problem here?')
('Isla', 'Let me thank you all on behalf of all employees here.')
('Isla', 'Ilhan and Carlo said the whole store will offer our<br/>support to you and everyone else out there.')
('Isla', 'My part will be relatively small when compared to the<br/>two of them, but I plan on helping regardless.')
('Isla', 'Let me know if you need anything!')
('Isla', "Oh! I-I'm so glad you're not hurt...!")
('Isla', 'Even being able to walk outside is impressive enough,<br/>things being what they are right now.')
('Isla', 'Ilhan and Carlo are helping out Professor Cronkite in<br/>the meantime.')
('Isla', "It's admirable that they're trying to lend their aid,<br/>even at a time like this.")
('Isla', 'I do wonder if this is only happening in the capital...')
('Isla', "I worry about my family in Anchorville. I don't know<br/>what I'd do if something were to happen to them...")
('Isla', "My grandmother's condition has improved so much<br/>that even her doctor is impressed. She was able to<br/>watch the Revolution Festival broadcast remotely.")
('Isla', 'Her face brightened a lot after she saw me.')
('Isla', "She was so happy to see me get this far. And it<br/>wouldn't have happened without everyone who's<br/>supported me.")
('Isla', "I heard this morning that Grandma's health took a<br/>turn for the better.")
('Isla', 'And just in time for the Revolution Festival! It must<br/>be a good omen, right?')
('Isla', "I don't think she's improved enough to be able to see<br/>the events, but progress is progress.")
('Isla', 'Getting ready for the Revolution Festival is when it<br/>really dawns on you that the year is almost over.')
('Isla', "I've only been working here part time for three<br/>months, to be fair.")
('Isla', "But that only means I still have a lot of room<br/>to improve! I have to live up to the store's reputation.")
('Isla', "It's a relief to see things finally calm down.<br/>Honestly, I panicked a little when<br/>everything was still going on...")
('Isla', 'But the owner and boss barely even batted an eye.<br/>They just kept going about things so calmly and<br/>helped direct me.')
('Isla', "I'm so glad I got a job here.")
('Isla', "I still can't believe what happened to Creil...")
('Isla', "It's hard to even wrap my head around it. Honestly, it<br/>was scarier than when the war broke out.")
('Isla', 'But if the boss and the owner are both carrying on<br/>okay, then I just have to follow their lead!')
('Isla', 'Still, the state of emergency really worries me...')
('Isla', "What about my parents' house and the hospital?<br/>I hope Grandma is okay...")
('Isla', 'I heard the department store just opened up the<br/>rooftop terrace as a sort of lounge area.')
('Isla', "I bet it's a nice place to relax, especially with the<br/>incredible view of the city up there. They could even<br/>go as far as making it a small rooftop park.")
('Isla', "But the timing of it is kind of suspicious...<br/>They weren't copying our store, were they?!")
('Isla', 'Well, I guess imitation is the sincerest form<br/>of flattery.')
('Isla', 'Oh, now that I think about it, I have to put in a<br/>request for some time off.')
('Isla', "My family lives all the way in Anchorville, and my<br/>grandmother's health hasn't been so good lately...")
('Isla', "I'd like to pay them a visit next time I get the chance.")
('Isla', "Was the man that was coming by really the<br/>department store's manager?!")
('Isla', "I heard Ilhan and Carlo talking about it the other day,<br/>but I'm not sure...")
('Isla', "I go there all the time. I should've noticed sooner...")
('Isla', 'Did I exhaust all my brain cells cramming in info<br/>about orbal devices? Did I run out of space in<br/>my brain?')
('Isla', "Hi there! Welcome to Iota. Do you wish to hear<br/>about this month's staff pick?")
('Isla', 'We recommend taking a look at our brand-new<br/>vacuum cleaners and lamps! More efficient, and<br/>not as hot.')
('Isla', "The secret is behind Verne's newly patented low-load<br/>quartz circuitry and high conversion efficiency...")
('Manager Carlo', 'Oh. I see you memorized the new product features<br/>without even looking at the manual!')
('Manager Carlo', 'Good job right there. Especially with the explanation!<br/>It can be the tipping point towards convincing<br/>a customer. Kudos there, Isla!')
('Isla', "Ahaha, thanks. I've been enjoying learning more<br/>about orbal products.")
('Manager Carlo', 'Haha, glad to hear that! The job should be fun, too,<br/>after all.')
('Manager Carlo', "I know you said it wasn't what you were expecting,<br/>but I really appreciate all your hard work.")
('Manager Carlo', "Get the hang of your current job, and I'll teach you<br/>some basic maintenance after that.")
('Isla', "I'd love that! Learning about these devices has<br/>honestly just made me want to tear them apart<br/>even more.")
('Isla', 'I totally wanna see inside them!')
('Isla', "I've actually surprised myself. I used to find reading<br/>manuals a real struggle.")
('Isla', 'Now, I really want to learn more about orbal products<br/>and better handle the products our store sells.')
('Isla', "I've got Carlo's mentorship and Ilhan's<br/>thoughtfulness to thank for that!")
('Isla', 'This posh-looking elderly gentleman has<br/>started paying the café regular visits lately.')
('Isla', "He seems interested in our owner. Maybe he's<br/>looking for a friend?")
('Isla', "But I can't shake the feeling that I've seen him<br/>somewhere before...")
('Isla', "You can't deny just how good Ilhan's coffee is!")
('Isla', 'And here I was thinking that doubling as both the<br/>owner AND a barista in his own establishment would<br/>be hard on him.')
('Isla', "But it's like Ilhan was born to make coffee. He always<br/>looks so happy behind the counter!")
('Isla', "I'm real glad I got this job. This is my most<br/>interesting workplace yet!")
('Isla', 'Ilhan and Carlo apparently worked together ever<br/>since they were studying.')
('Isla', "I'm not surprised. Those two look like they can read<br/>each other's minds, they know each other so well!<br/>They're so supportive of each other.")
('Isla', "I recently started helping customers all by myself!<br/>I stopped relying on Carlo's help so much.")
('Isla', 'I hope I can continue learning how to offer our<br/>customers more specialized customer support with<br/>their orbal devices.')
('Isla', "I thought I'd work as a barista, but this isn't so bad.<br/>There's so much interesting stuff to learn in this<br/>position, too!")
('Isla', 'Speaking of help, my boss does an amazing job of<br/>supporting Ilhan, too.')
('Isla', "They compliment each other's weaknesses, making<br/>sure they can make their individual strengths flourish.<br/>Carlo makes it look so casual.")
('Isla', 'I could learn a thing or two...')
('Isla', "Hello! Welcome to Iota. If it's household orbal<br/>devices you want, they're over here!")
('Isla', "Phew... It feels like I've finally gotten used to<br/>this stuff. This kind of work is really refreshing and<br/>interesting once you actually give it a go.")
('Isla', "And the store's atmosphere can't be beat. I really<br/>hope I can keep this job long-term.")
('Isla', "But I have to brush up on my orbal knowledge if I<br/>wanna do that! Can't rely on my boss all the time.")
('Isla', 'Oh, hi... Are you looking for an orbal device?<br/>Hold on a minute, please...')
('Isla', "I'm still new here, so I might need to look at the<br/>manual for any more complicated questions.<br/>I apologize in advance for the inconvenience.")
('Isla', "I'll try my very hardest to fulfill your expectations, so<br/>your patience would be very much appreciated!")
('Isla', 'Here I was thinking the orbal café would require<br/>more café knowledge than orbal knowledge, but boy,<br/>was I wrong.')
('Isla', "Still, it's a trendy and fun place to work. Not exactly<br/>what I had in mind, but I'm not giving up! I'll give it<br/>my best shot!")
('Isla', "Experience with customers has really helped<br/>me lately. My boss hasn't even had to step in that<br/>much as of late!")
('Olivia', "I'm glad nothing interrupted the actual<br/>Revolution Festival!")
('Olivia', "It's good to lift your spirits at times like these with<br/>things you enjoy, after all!")
('Olivia', "With everyone still shaken up over everything, I'm<br/>glad that the Revolution Festival is still<br/>taking place.")
('Olivia', 'Especially with some Oración big shots like Auclair<br/>and Daltie involved in all of this...')
('Olivia', 'Nothing to do about it, I guess! Things should calm<br/>down after the festival, at least.')
('Olivia', 'Markley and my husband have been very anxious this<br/>whole time, insisting I go home.')
('Olivia', 'But now that we finally purchased an apartment in<br/>the capital, I wanted to settle in and adjust to the<br/>culture here.')
('Olivia', "Oh, my. Is it that late already? I should get going<br/>home, though perhaps I'll stop by the department<br/>store first.")
('Olivia', "I'm in the mood to cook for myself for a change.")
('Olivia', 'Now that I finally have an apartment of my own, I try<br/>to make the most of those mundane parts of life.')
('Olivia', "It's not just been café scouting for me the past few<br/>days. I've taken to exploring the whole city. I even<br/>visited Trion Tower for the first time.")
('Olivia', "Who knew it'd take me until this stage in my life to<br/>slow down and smell the roses? Different cultures and<br/>stores can all be so fascinating.")
('Olivia', 'As a child, all I did was attend fancy balls and take<br/>violin lessons. To me, that was the height of culture.')
('Olivia', "It's taken me until now to realize just how narrow<br/>that worldview is.")
('Olivia', 'These places are all so fascinating, I just had to<br/>recommend them to the ladies back in Oración.')
('Olivia', "They sadly didn't seem interested. Everyone there is<br/>so old-fashioned—cutting edge technology doesn't<br/>catch their eye.")
('Olivia', "I suppose that's Oración for you, but it's a<br/>shame regardless. And I say that as someone<br/>from there.")
('Olivia', 'I made the right choice buying an apartment in the<br/>capital, with there being interesting state-of-the-art<br/>stores like this one in the vicinity.')
('Olivia', "I used to spend the summer at our holiday home, but<br/>there's so much more to see and do in the capital that<br/>this might be my new top choice.")
('Olivia', "This café is so cozy, despite how trendy it is. It's still<br/>quite comfortable and homey, even despite all the<br/>cutting-edge tech they have in stock.")
('Olivia', "I wonder what I should buy... Oh, well! No reason to<br/>rush whatsoever. I'm in no rush to leave the capital.")
('Olivia', 'I never get tired of this place, no matter how many<br/>times I come here.')
('Olivia', "Oh, so this is that orbal store I've heard so<br/>much about.")
('Olivia', 'What a novel idea to combine the café setting with<br/>an orbal store. Gives you the time to relax with a nice<br/>cup of coffee while you browse around.')
('Olivia', 'A stylish place like this would have been unthinkable<br/>back in my hometown of Oración.')
('Butler Markley', 'Hmm... Mistress Olivia has more or less finished all<br/>her negotiations.')
('Butler Markley', "The master is still very busy in Oración, so you'd<br/>imagine she'd show some restraint whilst she's here.")
('Butler Markley', "He's got a lot on his hands, trying to quell the chaos<br/>that Daltie and Edmond's arrests have caused.")
('Butler Markley', 'As such, he will be spending the entirety of the<br/>Revolution Festival in Oración.')
('Butler Markley', "That's why Mistress Olivia is here. She's here to act<br/>as his representative in the capital while the master<br/>is busy. Or...she's supposed to, anyhow.")
('Butler Markley', "*sigh* In reality, she's just acting like she's here to<br/>sightsee, and not like she has duties to fulfill.")
('Butler Markley', "It'd be for the best if Mistress Olivia could return to<br/>Oración for the time being, but neither her nor the<br/>master seem to care much right now.")
('Butler Markley', "Some carelessness is fine here and there, but it's like<br/>she's forgotten why she's actually here.")
('Butler Markley', 'The apartment purchase here in Edith was done with<br/>the express purpose of making her work as<br/>representative easier.')
('Butler Markley', 'Yes, sir... I think it may be a good idea for Mistress<br/>Olivia to return to Oración for the time being.')
('Butler Markley', "If her job was to spend all her time relaxing at trendy<br/>state-of-the-art cafés, she'd be excelling at it.")
('Butler Markley', 'However, it seems as if she has forgotten the reason<br/>why we purchased an apartment here in the capital<br/>in the first place...')
('Butler Markley', 'Mistress Olivia has taken quite a shine towards this<br/>establishment, but I do wonder if her attachment has<br/>started to border on excessive.')
('Butler Markley', "Then again, I wouldn't quite say it's a bad<br/>thing either...")
('Butler Markley', 'Her time spent in this orbal café might just be for the<br/>purpose of purchasing some goods for the master.')
('Butler Markley', 'The store does seem to stock quite high-end orbal<br/>appliances not commonly available.')
('Butler Markley', "Though Mistress Olivia isn't the most experienced in<br/>the field of orbal devices, so I would much rather<br/>she'd leave the task to me.")
('Butler Markley', 'That said...it is part of my job to keep her in check<br/>as well. She tends to be a bit of a free spirit.')
('Butler Markley', 'While I do agree the purchase of the apartment in the<br/>city was necessary, I feel like restraint is being left by<br/>the wayside overall.')
('Butler Markley', "Mistress Olivia has taken quite a shine to<br/>this establishment. I'm not surprised, considering a<br/>store like this isn't commonplace in Oración.")
('Butler Markley', 'Regardless of that, she could stand to show<br/>some restraint. Her trip here is for business, after all.<br/>Not for pleasure.')
('Butler Markley', 'Haha. Coming to this café was a fantastic choice.')
('Butler Markley', 'This orbal café seems to be a new business.')
('Butler Markley', "I've heard that the owner is still a young man with a<br/>track record of successful start-ups ever since his<br/>school days.")
('Butler Markley', "We've got a lot to learn from novel ideas like this...")
('Kei', 'Your work to liberate this area is much appreciated.')
('Kei', 'Seeing you work so hard to help out has made me<br/>realize I should strive for the same.')
('Kei', "Not by fighting, of course. I'm putting my<br/>observational skills to the test so that I may help<br/>relay information to Marduk and the guild both.")
('Kei', 'My hope is to be able to contribute with<br/>helping refugees. No matter how small, I must do<br/>my part.')
('Kei', "I'm unsure as to what I should do in a situation<br/>like this... It's so out of my depth.")
('Kei', "While it's reassuring to have Professor Cronkite and<br/>Associate Professor Esmeray with us...")
('Kei', "...I can't help but feel pathetic at not being able to<br/>contribute whatsoever.")
('Kei', 'And so the year came and went.')
('Kei', "It wasn't really my intention to become a regular of<br/>this establishment, but I can't deny it's helped me<br/>make progress on my thesis.")
('Kei', 'Analyzing the organizational logistics and<br/>transportation system behind the festival might be a<br/>fun endeavor.')
('Kei', "I'll continue doing research in the capital during the<br/>upcoming year as well, so it looks like my regular<br/>visits to this café will continue.")
('Kei', 'Now that I think about it, a lot more institute<br/>associates have been invited to the festival than usual.')
('Kei', 'Professor Cronkite was to be expected, of course,<br/>considering his involvement in the development of<br/>the new weaponry being unveiled.')
('Kei', "But Professor Hamilton being here caught me<br/>off guard. I'd love to get the chance to speak with her.")
('Kei', "The Basel Institute of Science's professors have all<br/>been invited to the Revolution Festival this year.")
('Kei', "I'm aware that Professor Hamilton wasn't present last<br/>year, nor a few years before that. It's her first time<br/>attending in a while.")
('Kei', "I did hear they're planning on unveiling new<br/>weaponry, that with which Professor Cronkite<br/>himself was involved in developing.")
('Kei', "Weaponry is not one of my areas of interest, but I'm<br/>nonetheless intrigued to see the fruits of his labor.")
('Kei', "I'm so grateful that we get the opportunity to properly<br/>celebrate the Revolution Festival again this year.")
('Kei', 'Classes and research have gone back to normal in<br/>Basel as well, so things are finally going back<br/>to normal.')
('Kei', 'Nothing will ever bring Professor Callaghan back, but<br/>time marches on ever forward. The institute will<br/>continue their research programs for his sake.')
('Kei', 'What happened to Creil is still so hard to wrap my<br/>head around...')
('Kei', "It's not my area of study, so I'm not sure about all<br/>the details.")
('Kei', "But I feel like I remember a hypothetical discussion<br/>regarding those kinds of weapons in one of Professor<br/>Callaghan's lectures.")
('Kei', 'Maybe he was manipulated by the mafia in<br/>some way?')
('Kei', "Y-You're Professor Hamilton's student.<br/>Quatre, right? I wasn't aware you were in the capital.")
('Quatre', "Oh, you must be Kei. You're Associate Professor<br/>Tain's student.")
('Quatre', "I heard you're carrying out some field research<br/>regarding urban engineering.")
('Kei', "Yes. That's why I come to the capital so often.<br/>Though right now I'm mostly here just to visit<br/>my parents.")
('Kei', 'They were worried half to death after everything that<br/>happened in Basel.')
('Van', 'I mean, I get why your folks would be worried.<br/>Shit got real messy back there.')
('Kei', "The institute's still dealing with the aftermath of<br/>losing one of its professors, so a lot of classes are<br/>being canceled.")
('Kei', "It's a little better now with Professor Hamilton taking<br/>charge, but it's not perfect either.")
('Kei', "So I'll be staying with my parents until things settle<br/>down back at the institute.")
('Quatre', 'I see... Gran must be working really hard.')
('Quatre', "You mentioned your parents, didn't you...?")
('Kei', 'Hmm? What was that, Quatre?')
('Quatre', "Nothing... Don't mind me.")
('Quatre', 'Well, I wish you the best of luck in your research as a<br/>fellow student.')
('Kei', "Things seem to be getting back on track in Basel,<br/>partially thanks to Professor Hamilton's hard work.")
('Kei', 'I never expected to get the chance to see her again,<br/>although I wish it could have been under less<br/>worrying circumstances.')
('Kei', "Last I'd seen her was during my first year trip at<br/>the institute. She was just as lovely this time as she<br/>was back then.")
('Kei', "I know she was going to continue her research into<br/>the desertification of the east, so I imagine she'll be<br/>returning to her travels soon.")
('Kei', 'I should be able to get back to Basel by the end of the<br/>day if I take the next train.')
('Kei', "The main reason for my visiting of Edith is to visit<br/>my parents, but I'm quite enjoying my field<br/>research, too.")
('Kei', 'I might be able to motivate some of the<br/>underclassmen to take on field research, too, if I could<br/>show them how much fun it can be.')
('Kei', "I've been trying to conduct some investigation into<br/>the capital's underground infrastructure on the side.")
('Kei', "Utilizing underground space in the form of a subway<br/>really is a revolutionary idea, isn't it?")
('Kei', 'But there are plenty of spaces that were abandoned<br/>during the development process that still have<br/>untapped potential.')
('Kei', "A whole district could be created out of all that<br/>unused underground space, so it'd be a shame for it to<br/>go to waste.")
('Kei', "One of the most fascinating aspects of urban<br/>engineering is just conserving the history behind the<br/>places you're helping develop.")
('Kei', 'How to keep old geographical landmarks around and<br/>preserve their history while continuing to develop<br/>their utility.')
('Kei', "Trion Tower and Edith's subways called to me.<br/>They're the reason I chose to pursue this field.")
('Kei', "I don't know if I would've pursued it, and gone on<br/>to study at the Basel Institute of Science, had I lived<br/>anywhere else.")
('Kei', "My parents' place being in the capital has come in<br/>handy for me. It facilitates me visiting for research<br/>so often.")
('Kei', "Associate Professor Tain is the institute's main<br/>specialist in urban engineering.")
('Kei', 'Though Professor Cronkite has some experience in<br/>the field, too. He was involved with Trion Tower,<br/>after all.')
('Kei', "Well, he's a genius, after all. Far be it for him to limit<br/>himself and his knowledge to just one area<br/>of expertise.")
('Kei', "While Professor Cronkite is definitely one of the<br/>biggest names in Basel, there's still plenty of other<br/>geniuses at the institute.")
('Kei', "It's hard not to feel self-conscious about your<br/>mediocrity when your next-door neighbor skipped to<br/>doing his master's degree at fifteen.")
('Kei', "I've been researching the urban structure of the<br/>capital while visiting my parents. Thanks to this<br/>place, my stay has been really productive.")
('Kei', 'I thought to check it out since I heard the owner also<br/>studied at the institute. It turned out to be a really<br/>comfortable spot to work in.')
('Kei', 'The excellent connection makes working a cinch, but<br/>the atmosphere is great for when you need to take<br/>a break and recharge, too.')
('Kei', 'I have to give it to Ilhan. This idea was a success.')
('Kei', "As a result, the influence of Trion Tower can be<br/>observed in various aspects of the capital's<br/>urban design...")
('Kei', 'In addition, the industrial structure, which was future<br/>proofed under the assumption that the underground<br/>transportation system would expand...')
('Kei', "Phew, time to take a break. It's easy to relax after<br/>some hard work in this store. I don't even have to<br/>think of the impending tasks I haven't done!")
('Kei', "Anyway, I'm almost halfway through my urban<br/>engineering report. Time to put my nose to<br/>the grindstone!")
('Alicia', "That wallet was a birthday gift from my parents.<br/>It's really special to me.")
('Alicia', "I'm willing to pay whatever's necessary to get it back,<br/>even if I have to purchase it back from the<br/>black market.")
('Alicia', 'Thank you so much, and good luck with your search!')
('Yimai', 'Been a while since I last got the chance to buy some<br/>stock from repair shops and black market dealers.')
('Yimai', "I did happen to hear a survivor of Creil's been<br/>working at Thunders.")
('Yimai', 'Mighty awful, what happened there. I feel sorry for<br/>the lass.')
('Yimai', "It's the kind of wound even revenge can't heal.<br/>You don't just bounce back from something so awful.")
('Yimai', "I'm not the most spotless person here, but I still feel<br/>just awful for her. Can't imagine what she's<br/>going through.")
('Yimai', 'These indiscriminate attacks are just unforgivable.')
('Magisa', "Station Street's changed a whole lot since I was last<br/>above ground. It's all new and trendy shops around.")
('Magisa', "Leaves an old lady like me in the dust, I'd say.<br/>Spend a little too much time underground, and the<br/>whole world changes 'round ya.")

('Seyla', 'I have something here for you, actually! I hope you<br/>like it.')

('Ms. Sonia', "I can't afford to waste any time. I can do this!")
('Ms. Sonia', 'Was that Mr. Powell we saw earlier?')

('Ms. Sonia', "I'm guessing you're on your way back from<br/>club practice? It's rather late...")
('Sasha', 'Oh, yeah. You see, the winter nationals are just<br/>around the corner.')
('Sasha', "So it's extra important I escort the students at least<br/>partway home, since they don't have club practice.")

('James', "Wh-Why are you even bringing that up?! That's<br/>old news!")

('Van', "Gotta shell out for my assistants, you know. Even if<br/>the costs are startin' to pile up.")

('Inspector Daswani', "Oh, I'm already done for the day. I just stopped by<br/>one of the stores in front of the station.")
('Inspector Daswani', "I'll be back home soon, don't worry. I'll even stop by<br/>for one of Gigi's favorite cupcakes on the way—")
('Inspector Daswani', 'Huh? No? Maybe a bagel, then...?')
('Inspector Daswani', '...Yeah. Yeah. Love you. See you later.')
('Inspector Daswani', 'What? You got a problem?')
('Van', 'Nope. Not at all.')
('Van', "That your wife, I'm guessing? Didn't know you had a<br/>daughter either. Look at you playin' the family man.")

('Inspector Daswani', "Cheesecake? Now that's an idea... N-Not that I was<br/>asking for your opinion!")
('Inspector Daswani', "You'll start straightening up one day, when you have<br/>a family. With one on the line, you don't just get to<br/>do whatever you want.")

('Detective Nate', "*sigh* Tyrell's girls are too eccentric for me, and the<br/>women in the police department just have no cool.")

('Detective Nate', '*sigh* Man, I feel close to my limit.')
('Sr. Officer Paul', "You're having a hard time, too, yeah? That why<br/>you're on patrol duty?")
('Sr. Officer Paul', 'I guess Almata HAS been quiet.')
('Sr. Officer Paul', "But we can't relax just yet. We never know when<br/>they'll strike again, after all.")
('Detective Nate', "It's hard to request a day off when things are like this.")
('Detective Nate', "We'd better hurry up and arrest those guys! At least<br/>then I'll be able to get back in my girlfriend's<br/>good books.")
('Sr. Officer Paul', "Flimsy motivation aside, I guess we're both aiming for<br/>the same thing. Let's catch those guys.")
('Cao', "It's so rare I get the chance to talk to these two.<br/>I always find our discussions most fascinating.")
('Cao', "Now, we at Heiyue find ourselves very interested in<br/>finding out more about Professor Cronkite's<br/>contractual partner and Marduk's future prospects.")
('Cao', "I would definitely appreciate the chance to converse<br/>about each other's opinions.")
('Van', "Hey, man, do whatever you want. Err...<br/>Actually, maybe don't.")
('Professor Cronkite', "I quite enjoyed the café right across the street, but<br/>even then, I can't say I'm altogether too fond of the<br/>drinks here.")
('Professor Cronkite', "Basel-style cafés don't seem to have made their mark<br/>in the capital just yet.")
('General Manager Thorndyke', 'Actually, they seem to be spreading more in the<br/>Ored direction...')
('General Manager Thorndyke', 'I believe I heard that the Langport-style café that sells<br/>Eastern tea over at Trion Tower is giving the<br/>Basel-style one some fierce competition.')
('Cao', 'Indeed. In fact, that establishment is managed by<br/>yours truly. We have the privilege of enjoying quite<br/>the favorable reputation.')
('Cao', "It's not just our staples capturing the public's interest,<br/>like our brown sugar bubble tea. Our newest fruit<br/>vinegar item has also proven popular.")
('Cao', "Would you two be interested in trying the deep,<br/>complex flavor of Eastern tea at some point? It's an<br/>entirely different experience from coffee.")
('Professor Cronkite', 'Hmm... Sounds enticing.')
('General Manager Thorndyke', 'Now we absolutely HAVE to give it a try.')
('Van', '(Damn. Shit might not be authentic, but I still wanna<br/>give it a try...)')
('Van', '(Maybe I should go and take a look around<br/>Trion Tower...)')

('Aaron', '(Oh, yeah. Those kinds of cafés are all<br/>over Langport.)')
('Risette', "(Coffee and Eastern tea... I kind of feel like I'm<br/>seeing the same mistakes happen all over again...)")
('Quatre', '(Hmm. Yang spends more time thinking about coffee<br/>than his actual studies.)')
('Judith', '(Oh, I love that Eastern café! Their tea is<br/>honestly amazing.)')
('Bergard', "(And the world marches ever forward. But even if<br/>times change, I'm not ready to cast old-fashioned<br/>coffee shops aside just yet.)")
('General Manager Thorndyke', "That was quite the impressive show of skill back<br/>there. It would seem Twinings and the Security<br/>Chief weren't exaggerating their reports after all.")
('General Manager Thorndyke', "Either way, I'm pleased to see you've been<br/>making sufficient use of both your holo core<br/>and stun caliber.")
('General Manager Thorndyke', "Heh... Apologies for my haughty tone. I'm sure<br/>I'll receive a scolding for it from a certain service<br/>concierge later.")

('General Manager Thorndyke', "He's also been entrusted with his own independent<br/>operation on top of his job of watching for the<br/>populace's safety.")
('General Manager Thorndyke', "I'm sure he'll be able to get to the bottom of things.")
('Van', "Yeah. I ran into him in Riverside. Just as imposin'<br/>as ever.")
('Van', "(Can't shake this odd feelin' here.)")
('Van', 'An independent operation, huh.')
('Van', "(Well, at least he's lookin' into things.)")
('General Manager Thorndyke', 'I must thank you for your significant contributions<br/>towards the development of both the holo core and<br/>stun caliber.')
('General Manager Thorndyke', "Your contributions as a tester have been invaluable.<br/>I'm certainly counting on you and Risette.")
('General Manager Thorndyke', "I'd love to talk to you all in private, if I get<br/>the chance.")
('Van', 'Sure. I can hear you out. After that, though?<br/>No promises.')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "We should be able to get in touch with Chief<br/>Rouran shortly. It'll be a retroactive report, but it's<br/>best that we stay prepared.")

('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', 'For starters, I plan on getting in touch with<br/>each district.')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "Have you considered joining forces with Risette?<br/>I expect that'd make conducting your investigation<br/>more efficient.")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "Today's the perfect day for a clandestine meeting, so<br/>it's when we have to keep our eyes peeled.")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "But out of everyone that showed up today, it had to<br/>be Heiyue, Marduk's general manager, and that<br/>famous professor.")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', '(Phew, I know who I need to update later...)')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', 'The Revolution Festival is going to consist of two<br/>official events—the ceremony and the memorial mass<br/>at the cathedral.')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', 'We plan on tightening security measures everywhere,<br/>regardless of the current state of matters with Almata.')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "Were they able to still, the Revolution Festival<br/>would've been the perfect time to strike.")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', 'To be honest, I do feel somewhat relieved.')
('Hazel', 'Thought you might show up sooner or later. I take it<br/>this is about the unofficial partnership between the<br/>guild and CID?')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "That it is. Glad that we're on the same page, at least.")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "Our first priority should be getting the situation<br/>under control, not being at each other's throats.")
('Hazel', 'I guarantee you that the guild holds no ill will towards<br/>the CID.')
('Hazel', '...Even if you DID steal Kilika from us.')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', 'W-Well, umm... That was more than five years<br/>ago now. Surely, water under the bridge?')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "(They can't still be mad about that! I guess wisdom<br/>and age don't necessarily pair together...)")
('Hazel', 'I do agree with you for the most part. When it comes<br/>to saving the citizens of this capital, every<br/>minute counts.')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "Precisely! You'll have to excuse me for jumping right<br/>into it, but how about we discuss the main points of<br/>our collaboration?")
('Professor Cronkite', "Hmm... The coffee here isn't bad at all.")
('Professor Cronkite', 'This place has brought Basel-style coffee to a whole<br/>new level, though I expected no less than perfection<br/>from an Institute of Science graduate.')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'All you ever talk about is coffee, you know.')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "You're, like, at least a LIIITTLE concerned about<br/>Professor Hamilton and Quatre, right?")
('Professor Cronkite', "Of course, but worrying won't get me anywhere.<br/>Speculation is pointless unless you put those thoughts<br/>into action.")
('Professor Cronkite', "I believe you're already aware of that, aren't<br/>you, Esmeray?")

('Associate Professor Esmeray', "Gotti's a famous movie director, right?")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "We don't have any movie theaters near the institute,<br/>so I haven't seen many films.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'Buuut I should have the time during the<br/>Revolution Festival. Maybe watching one<br/>will teach me a thing or two!')
('Professor Cronkite', "Though still missing a special something to take it<br/>over the edge, I can't quite complain when I shouldn't<br/>even have this chance in the first place.")
('Professor Cronkite', "Don't you agree, Mr. Arkride?")
('Van', 'Agree with what?')
('Professor Cronkite', 'That even if the quality of a product leaves a lot to be<br/>desired, its relative value skyrockets during times<br/>of crisis.')
('Professor Cronkite', "You know the proverb, 'hunger is the best sauce'?<br/>Well, that isn't just a theory.")
('Professor Cronkite', 'It is an extremely logical and systematic social,<br/>psychological, and physical phenomenon.')
('Van', '...')
('Risette', 'Umm, Professor? What might you...?')
('Professor Cronkite', 'If I may ask, what are your thoughts on this<br/>phenomenon happening?')
('Professor Cronkite', "Or, more than that, why do you think it is that<br/>some people can move, while some can't?")

('Professor Cronkite', "There's no effect without cause.")
('Professor Cronkite', "You may be able to change or manipulate it, but it<br/>won't necessarily mean you've eradicated said cause.")
('Professor Cronkite', "I recommend you keep that in mind if you're going to<br/>continue looking into this anomaly.")
('Van', "...Got'cha. Guess it makes sense one of Hamilton's<br/>pupils and Quatre's senior would know<br/>something more.")
('Van', "We'll keep it in mind.")
('Professor Cronkite', 'As irritating as Esmeray can be, I believe<br/>collaborating with her is my best recourse.')
('Professor Cronkite', "I'm planning on trying an orbal tech-based approach<br/>to this anomaly henceforth.")
('Professor Cronkite', 'I suppose I could offer my assistance, should I make<br/>any discoveries. If time remains frozen, it will only<br/>prove to be a hindrance to my research.')

('Agnès', 'Was Giacomo the one who altered the locks like this?')
('Van', "Not him. It's just been a thing us shady folks have<br/>known about for a while.")
('Van', "There're places like this all over the city people make<br/>good use of.")
('Van', "CID knows about 'em, too. They just leave it alone.")
('Agnès', 'Th-They do? Why?')
('Agnès', "...I'm sorry. I keep egging conversation on when we<br/>really need to move.")
('Agnès', "I'm ready for whatever we'll find here.")
('Van', "Good. 'Cause there's no turnin' back now.")
('Van', '...?')
('Agnès', 'Hmm? Is something wrong?')
('Van', 'Nah. We can go in.')
('Van', "(Was that just my imagination? ...Ehh, I don't pick<br/>up a scent, so I guess it doesn't matter either way.)")
('Renne', 'Heehee. His nose is as sharp as ever.')
('Renne', 'Aidios knows how this is going to end...but it better<br/>be with my classmate safe, spriggan.')
('Van', "Man, all that build up and then they're outta stuff to<br/>make the lattes with. What a let down.")
('Agnès', 'At least the coffee was good!')
('Van', "I guess. Maybe I'll mosey by this evening and see if<br/>they've restocked.")
('Van', "Definitely not gonna hang around this neck of the<br/>woods if I don't have to.")
('Agnès', 'So your distaste of the guild even trumps your love<br/>of sweets?')
('Agnès', '(Or maybe this is more about one specific bracer...)')
('Van', "Why're you staring at me like that?")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Hey there. Working hard or hardly working?')
('Van', '...')
('Agnès', 'Huh?')
('Bracer Alvis', 'Ugh. You again...')
('Elaine', 'Van and...the girl from before.')
('Agnès', 'Oh, hello, Elaine.')
('Van', 'Bah. Shoulda bolted when we had the chance.')
('Zin the Immovable', "So you're the kid Elaine grew up with, huh?")
('Zin the Immovable', "Nice to meet you. I'm—")
('Van', "Zin the Immovable. One of the guild's go-to guys.")
('Van', 'A master-level Taito practitioner and A-rank<br/>bracer—though some folks say you should be S-rank<br/>by now.')
('Zin the Immovable', 'You know your stuff.')
('Zin the Immovable', "I'm Zin Vathek. Don't think I'm quite the figure you<br/>make me out to be, though.")
('Zin the Immovable', "It's nice to finally meet you, spriggan.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Sounds like we owe you for the other day.')
('Van', "Don't sweat it. Not about to pass up the chance to<br/>put you guys in my debt.")
('Van', "Name's Van Arkride.")
('Van', "Would've rather not met you, but here we are.")
('Zin the Immovable', "That so? Heh. Well, it's nice to meet you all<br/>the same.")
('Bracer Alvis', 'Wh-Why are you being so friendly to him?!')
('Bracer Alvis', "This guy's been stealing our jobs and doing shady<br/>stuff for years!")
('Bracer Alvis', 'To be honest, we probably have reasonable grounds<br/>to apprehend him!')
('Agnès', '...')
('Van', "Can't argue there.")
('Elaine', "*sigh* That's so like you to say.")
('Elaine', 'Zin, we have nothing to gain by associating with<br/>this man.')
('Elaine', 'Come what may, he will expertly skirt the line of<br/>legality and our code to avoid incriminating himself.')
('Elaine', 'We need not interact with him more than the bare<br/>minimum necessary to do our duties, as we did the<br/>other day.')
('Van', 'See? She gets me.')
('Elaine', 'Be quiet, Van.')
('Van', "...Yes, ma'am.")
('Bracer Alvis', 'W-Wow...')
('Agnès', '(I thought as much...)')
('Zin the Immovable', "Hahaha! Isn't that something?")
('Zin the Immovable', "You've got a Xipha, right?")
('Van', "Uh, yeah? What's it to you?")
('Mare', 'Contact information exchanged with the Calvard<br/>Bracer Guild—commissions received.')
('Van', 'Wait, what?!')
('Elaine', 'Are you sure this is wise?!')
('Bracer Alvis', "You can't be serious...")
('Zin the Immovable', 'See, we just got in a few big jobs...')
('Zin the Immovable', '...but Elaine and I are going to be out of town for a<br/>few days.')
('Zin the Immovable', "You wouldn't mind helping us out a bit, would ya?")
('Zin the Immovable', "I don't see the harm in letting you take care of some<br/>simple jobs like monster exterminations.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Well, that and some are a little too gray for us, if you<br/>catch my meaning.')
('Elaine', '...')
('Bracer Alvis', 'H-Hold on...')
('Agnès', '...')
('Van', "I guess looks can be deceivin', huh?")
('Van', "You're built like a bear, but sly as a fox.")
('Van', "All right. I'll take your jobs—for 20% more than your<br/>goin' rate.")
('Van', "But if they ain't my style, I'm not doin' it. That work<br/>for you?")
('Zin the Immovable', "Sure does. You can look over the two I just sent you,<br/>but I don't think there should be an issue with either.")
('Zin the Immovable', "I'd like you to take care of at least one of 'em. It's in a<br/>place you've got a bit of a connection to now.")
('Van', "Oh? Well, whatever. I'll look at 'em later.")
('Bracer Alvis', "Th-This isn't a good idea! We can't trust a shady<br/>character like this guy with our work!")
('Zin the Immovable', "I understand your reservations, but with as much<br/>work as we have piling up, now's not the time to get<br/>picky about help.")
('Zin the Immovable', "I'll handle the reports and getting this approved.<br/>That okay with you, Elaine?")
('Elaine', '*sigh* So be it.')
('Zin the Immovable', "Well, we've got a train to catch. See you two around.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Alvis and I will go buy the tickets, so if you wanna say<br/>anything to this guy, make it quick.')
('Elaine', 'Wh-What do you...?')
('Bracer Alvis', 'Grr...')
('Elaine', '*sigh* Unbelievable...')
('Elaine', "I see you're just as popular with your seniors as ever.<br/>Too bad only men fall for it.")
('Van', "My charms work on the ladies, too, y'know.")
('Van', "Might've met my match with that guy, though.<br/>Zin's gonna be a tougher cookie than I thought.")
('Van', 'Finally see how he can go toe to toe with that freak<br/>of nature.')
('Elaine', "...Hmm? No, never mind. I don't have time to dig<br/>into that right now.")
('Elaine', "Just so you know, A's been silent since what<br/>happened. It'll be a while until we learn<br/>anything more.")
('Van', 'Figures.')
('Agnès', '...')
('Elaine', "So you're a client of his, correct? Agnès, was it?")
('Agnès', "Y-Yes, that's right! I really appreciate your help the<br/>other day, too!")
('Elaine', "I appreciate the sentiment, but I didn't contribute<br/>much, really.")
('Elaine', 'What are you doing out and about with him<br/>today, though?')
('Elaine', "Given that you're not wearing your uniform, is your<br/>request not over yet?")
('Van', 'Well—')
('Agnès', 'Umm... That is part of it, yes.')
('Agnès', "But I'm also working part-time at Arkride<br/>Solutions now.")
('Agnès', "Today's my first day on the job.")
('Elaine', 'Wha...')
('Elaine', 'Explain yourself. Now.')
('Van', 'Hey, I tried to turn her down!')
('Van', "I'm tellin' you, she's craftier than she looks!<br/>Sure, there is some other stuff goin' on, but—")
('Elaine', "No 'stuff' could excuse this! What are<br/>you THINKING?!")
('Elaine', "She's a civilian! What would you do if<br/>she got—?!")
('Bracer Alvis', "Elaine! The train's leaving in a minute!")
(40000, "Wait, did he just say 'Elaine'?")
(40001, 'What? THE Elaine? No way!')
('Elaine', "...This conversation is not over, for the record.<br/>Don't think you can avoid me forever.")
('Elaine', 'Agnès, please, please be careful. You better keep<br/>her safe.')
('Elaine', 'Sorry to keep you waiting.')
('Bracer Alvis', "Don't sweat it—but we need to go!")
('Agnès', 'Umm...')
('Van', "Bah. Somethin' tells me she's gonna keep houndin'<br/>for answers till she gets one.")
('Van', 'Now how am I gonna shake her off next time...?')
('Agnès', '...')
('Agnès', 'So...I take it you two are close?')
('Van', "That's a generous way to put it. We just go way back,<br/>is all.")
('Van', "Even though we've both been in the capital for a<br/>while, I hadn't seen her for three years till<br/>just recently.")
('Agnès', 'I...see. But you seemed so... Never mind.')
('Van', "Huh? Well, anyway. Coulda gone without meetin'<br/>the big guy, to be honest.")
('Van', "I mean, who'd've guessed Zin the Immovable, of all<br/>people, would be dumpin' work on us.")
('Agnès', 'I know what you mean. Even people outside of<br/>Calvard would recognize his name.')
('Agnès', 'Did you look at the jobs he sent to your Xipha yet?')
('Van', 'Not yet. *sigh* Guess I oughta look.')
('Agnès', 'Oh...')
('Van', "So that's their game.")
('Van', 'One of them sounds like my usual kind of thing.')
('Van', "As for the other, the cops took so long investigatin'<br/>Giacomo that a monster moseyed in, eh?")
('Agnès', 'So it seems...')
('Van', "Handy that both of 'em are close to the areas we were<br/>already plannin' to cover.")
('Van', 'None of this was on the docket, though.')
('Van', "You're cool to call it a day and head back to<br/>the office.")
('Agnès', "I'd like to keep helping, if you'll have me.")
('Agnès', 'This is my first day on the job after all.')
('Van', 'Heh. Then I guess we oughta get back to work.')
('Elaine', 'What are YOU doing here?')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Arkride, you made it!')
('Zin the Immovable', 'I called him over to hash out some<br/>important business.')
('Van', 'You heard the man. Quit glaring daggers at me.')
('Agnès', "It's...uh...good to see you again.")
('Elaine', "The same to you. Let me guess, you're working<br/>again today?")
('Elaine', "And then there's this one...")
('Feri', 'Hmm? Oh, right! My name is Ferida Al-Fayed.')
('Feri', 'I work with Agnès and Van now.')
('Feri', "I'm still learning the ropes, but I'll take on any job—<br/>no matter how dangerous!")
('Van', 'Come on, you think I had a choice in this?')
('Van', "'Sides, it's plain as day she ain't your average kid.")
('Elaine', 'Are you a jaeger by any chance?')
('Feri', "Yes! I'm from the Warriors of Kruga. Well, until I<br/>got kicked out, that is.")
('Elaine', 'I see... So you were involved in what happened<br/>in Creil.')
('Zin the Immovable', "That's just the topic I was hoping to discuss.")
('Zin the Immovable', "Mind filling us in on what went down? Alvis' story<br/>was full of holes.")
('Van', "...I'll tell you what I can, but nothin' about my clients.")
('System', 'Van explained the nightmare that unfolded in Creil...')
('System', '...though he naturally left out details such as<br/>the Geneses.')
('Zin the Immovable', "Hmm... That Walter's just full of surprises.")
('Van', 'Old friend of yours, right? Heard you used to run<br/>together with your Taito stuff.')
('Zin the Immovable', "Your info-gathering's served you well.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'We trained under the same master until Walter lost<br/>his way over ten years ago.')
('Zin the Immovable', "But that's enough about me.")
('Zin the Immovable', "It's interesting that the society sent an Enforcer after<br/>A's people.")
('Elaine', 'Agreed. I could have easily seen them joining forces<br/>at some point.')
('Elaine', 'Though, that seems out of the question now.')
('Van', "Far as I know, the society's been quiet the last year<br/>or so.")
('Van', "Guessin' you guys are still chasin' them?")
('Zin the Immovable', "They're always a concern, but we can hardly<br/>prioritize them over Almata right now.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Hmm...')
('Elaine', "All that aside, I'm curious how deceased jaegers were<br/>able to get up and move around.")
('Van', "Your bracer buddy was seein' things. None of<br/>that happened.")
('Elaine', "Don't try that with me. There were sightings of<br/>monsters behaving strangely, too.")
('Elaine', "And Alvis isn't our only witness, a police officer on<br/>the scene also saw the Eisenschild leader disa—")
('Feri', '*sigh*...')
('Elaine', "I'm sorry. That was very insensitive of me.")
('Zin the Immovable', "Well, I'm sure you've got your reasons for<br/>keeping quiet.")
('Zin the Immovable', "We're up to our ears in work as is, so it's not like we<br/>can help out with whatever you're dealing with.")
('Zin the Immovable', "Hmm. Maybe it's about time to call in some backup.")
('Van', 'Oh?')
('Agnès', 'Bracers from the other Calvardian branches,<br/>I presume?')
('Elaine', "Actually, no. We're so short-staffed nationwide that<br/>branches are already sharing personnel to get by.")
('Elaine', "We've been toying with bringing in someone from<br/>another country to help ease the load.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Unfortunately, whether they can come or not is still<br/>up in the air.')
('Zin the Immovable', "So for the time being, I'll just have to dump as much<br/>work on you as you can take!")
('Van', "Bucko, we've got plenty to deal with already, y'know.")
('Feri', "Don't worry! I'm with you guys now, remember?")
('Elaine', 'Ferida, please take care of yourself.')
('Elaine', "And, Van, from now on I'll be sending your tasks<br/>straight to your Xipha via orbmail.")
('Elaine', "If an emergency happens, I may need to call.<br/>Don't ignore me if I do, all right?")
('Van', 'Sure thing.')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Achoo!')
('Bracer Alvis', "I hope you're not getting a cold...")
('Zin the Immovable', '*sniff* Nah. Probably just a certain lady talking about<br/>me somewhere.')
('Elaine', 'Back on topic, what were you saying, Alvis?')
('Bracer Alvis', 'Oh, right. Just that we have more threats to keep our<br/>eyes on than just the usual suspects and the society.')
('Bracer Alvis', 'Namely, that group that defeated the<br/>Eisenschild unit.')
('Bracer Alvis', "While they aren't part of Almata per se, the two<br/>groups seem related.")
('Elaine', "Agreed. Though, judging by the Almata executives<br/>that appeared in Langport, we'll have our hands full<br/>with them alone.")
('Elaine', "That said, I do agree we'll need to add the group<br/>Melchior originally came from to our watch list.")
('Elaine', 'Not to mention all the potential interlopers from<br/>the East...')
('Elaine', 'All the while, the CID shows no interest in<br/>sharing information.')
('Zin the Immovable', "Those guys've only gotten stingier with time.")
('Zin the Immovable', "And something tells me there's more to it than<br/>wanting to save face.")
('Elaine', 'I have the same feeling.')
('Elaine', "So for the time being, we're on our own.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Not quite. We can always call in a certain spriggan<br/>for backup.')
('Bracer Alvis', 'Why do you insist on relying on that criminal<br/>for help?!')
('Elaine', "I protest as well, Zin. I'm more inclined to send you<br/>to get information out of the CID for us.")
('Elaine', "Why don't you invite your master's daughter<br/>to dinner? You were students together, as I recall.")
('Elaine', "I'm sure you two have a LOT to talk about.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Have mercy on me...')
('Zin the Immovable', "Man, you used to be such a softie. How'd you get<br/>so tough?")
('Elaine', 'I owe it to years of training.')
('Elaine', "By the way, my suggestion just now wasn't a joke.")
('Elaine', "You are well acquainted with her, she once worked<br/>for the guild, and she has the former president's<br/>confidence, too.")
('Elaine', "We'd get a lot more out of her than my old friend at<br/>the CID.")
('Bracer Alvis', 'You do have a point...')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Hmm...')
('Fie', 'You mean the Flying Swallow, right?')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Ah! You made it.')
('Elaine', 'Has it already been a year? And did you get taller?')
('Fie', "Somehow, yeah. I think I'm done growing, though.")
('Bracer Alvis', "You're that ace bracer from the Empire, right?")
('Fie', "I suppose. The name's Fie Claussell.")
('Fie', "Starting today, I'll be working with you all here<br/>in Calvard.")
('System', 'Afterward, they went to Station Street to pick up<br/>some odds and ends.')
('System', 'Then, when it came time to return to the office...')
(500, 'October 18th, 3:30PM')
('Van', "It's a little early, but I think we should call it a day.")
('Van', 'You can head on back to the office. Agnès, feel free<br/>to go straight to the dorms, if you want.')
('Agnès', 'Really?')
('Feri', 'Does this have to do with your conversation with that<br/>bracer earlier?')
('Aaron', 'Is this about your call with the big guy earlier?')
('Van', "Nah, it's nothing that important.")
('Van', "Oh, and your trial period's over, Risette. I dunno how<br/>long you were plannin' on hangin' around, but we're<br/>happy to have you.")
('Risette', "Thank you. I'll bring the supplies we purchased back<br/>to our base.")
('Van', "'Preciate it. Anyway, don't stay out too late<br/>now, guys.")
('Agnès', 'Oh...')
('Feri', 'Hmph. Why is he running off all on his own?')
('Feri', 'Do you think we should track him?')
('Aaron', 'Hmph. Something about this rubs me the wrong way.')
('Aaron', 'What do you say we tail him?')
('Agnès', "W-We shouldn't invade his privacy...")
('Feri', "But aren't you curious, Agnès?")
('Aaron', "You're not fooling anyone. We both know you want<br/>to find out what's up.")
('Agnès', 'I-I mean... Yes, but...')
('Agnès', "Risette, aren't you against prying into Van's<br/>business, too?")
('Risette', "On the contrary, I'm in full support.")
('Risette', "I've been fiercely curious about his destination.")
('Risette', 'Furthermore, it seemed he was going there for the<br/>sake of his acquaintance rather than for<br/>personal business.')
('Risette', 'But in truth, I was recommended to start spending<br/>more time as I please, so I intend to do just that.')
('Agnès', 'Wh-What?!')
('Feri', "All right! Then we shouldn't leave anyone out.")
('Feri', "Let's call Aaron!")
('Aaron', 'Nice save, maid. We could use some help, though.')
('Aaron', "Let's give the pipsqueak a call.")
('Risette', 'Will you be coming along, Ms. Claudel?')
('Agnès', "I-I... *sigh* Fine, I don't want to be the only one<br/>left out!")
('Agnès', 'I really thought you were more mature than this...')
('Risette', 'I apologize for my imperfect nature. I am still only<br/>20, after all.')
(500, 'October 23rd, 1208, 6:32AM')
('Renne', 'Perhaps we arrived a little early.')
('Renne', 'Odette and Albert are coming from the 10th district,<br/>so they should be here before long.')
('Agnès', "Umm... I'm really sorry I've asked so much of you.")
('Agnès', "Don't worry, though. Even though I'll be away from<br/>the group, I promise I won't let it affect my work!")
('Renne', "Heehee. I never had any doubt. In fact, I've already<br/>told the—")
('Feri', 'Agnès!')
('Agnès', 'Oh!')
('Van', "Well, you're early. All ready to head out?")
('Agnès', 'Almost. The others should be—')
('Agnès', 'Oh! You finished working on the car!')
('Van', "Yeah. A mechanic over in Riverside had to lend a<br/>hand, but we got 'er ready in time.")
('Aaron', "If I squint hard enough, I can almost fool myself into<br/>thinking it's a limo.")
('Risette', 'The maximum occupancy has been improved from<br/>five to eight passengers—and it sports its own<br/>on-board computer.')
('Feri', 'We could even fit Agnès AND her friends now!')
('Agnès', 'I suppose you could.')
('Renne', "You've been up to some interesting business, now<br/>haven't you?")
('Van', "Not half as interestin' as any trip you're in charge of.")
('Van', "On the other hand, it's real reassurin' to know you'll<br/>be around in Basel. You know, just in case.")
('Renne', 'I could say the same of you.')
('Agnès', 'Hmm? Why do you seem to know each other so well?')
('Renne', 'Heehee. We have a little...history together, you see. ❤')
('Agnès', '...?!')
('Feri', 'Oh, my...')
('Aaron', 'Ding, ding—another challenger enters the ring.')
('Van', "We're talkin' about five years ago here. Stop bein'<br/>such a damn tease.")
('Renne', 'Oh, dear. How cold of you.')
('Agnès', "...I'm not going to get a real answer to this, am I?")
('Agnès', 'Regardless, what are you all doing here?')
('Van', 'Oh, right. Hey, Risette.')
('Risette', 'This is for you, Ms. Claudel.')
('Risette', 'There are sandwiches for breakfast, as well as<br/>some coffee.')
('Feri', 'Victor and Paulette asked us to give it to you!')
('Feri', 'They made more than enough for your friends to<br/>have some, too!')
('Agnès', 'How thoughtful of them.')
('Renne', 'I concur, and it smells wonderful, too.')
('Agnès', "Knowing the chef, it's sure to be great.")
('Albert', "What's going on here?!")
('Odette', "*whistle* Had to get in a heartfelt goodbye before<br/>you left? Don't make too much of a show of it,<br/>you two! ❤")
('Lyle', 'No way, she really does have a boyfriend at her job!')
('Albert', 'No she does not!')
('Agnès', 'Please, everyone, this is a misunderstanding.')
('Van', "Uhh, we'll go ahead and get out of your hair now.")
('Van', "We'll see you again in Basel, Agnès. Race ya there.")
('Agnès', 'R-Right! Travel safely, everyone.')
('Zin the Immovable', "Ah. Figured you'd come by eventually.")
('Fie', 'Hey.')
('Renne', "I can't say I'm surprised. You all feel compelled to act,<br/>too, I take it?")
('Van', 'Yeah. Looks like you guys are real busy here.')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Supremely. The two of us were out of town when it<br/>happened and had to rush right back.')
('Fie', 'We have to go back out again soon, though.')
('Agnès', "I wasn't expecting to find you here, too, Renne.<br/>You must have left extra early.")
('Renne', 'It seemed wise to come and exchange information on<br/>what Liberl and the society are up to.')
('Renne', 'I take it you all are here for the same reason?')
('Van', "Yeah. Sorry for eatin' into your time, but can we talk<br/>for a bit?")
('Van', 'So the whole region around Creil really did get locked<br/>down by the army, huh?')
('Aaron', "Can't say I blame them.")
('Fie', "It's to the point where not even press or the bracers<br/>can get close.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Everyone gets the same stock response from<br/>the authorities.')
('Zin the Immovable', "'There are no confirmed survivors among the villagers<br/>or visitors.'")
('Judith', 'Hmm...')
('Feri', "That's awful...")
('Van', "So if there's nobody left, why are they keepin' the area<br/>under lock and key?")
('Renne', 'As it so happens, the three disciples are rushing to<br/>the scene.')
('Quatre', 'All three?! Not just Professor Hamilton?!')
('Risette', 'Professors A. Russell, G. Schmidt, and L.<br/>Hamilton...')
('Risette', "...the continent's three greatest minds all in one place.")
('Renne', "I can't imagine they wanted to reunite under<br/>circumstances like these.")
('Judith', "This can't be any ordinary post-disaster<br/>investigation, then...")
('Renne', "Indeed, and I'm sure Quatre knows why as well.")
('Renne', 'The initial devastation caused by nuclear weapons is<br/>not the only reason why they are forbidden.')
('Quatre', 'Following detonation, radioactive particles will<br/>blanket the blast zone.')
('Quatre', "While still theoretical, it's thought this radiation will<br/>cause horrible chronic damage to both organisms and<br/>the environment.")
('Renne', 'When one of these weapons explodes, radioactive<br/>particles spread from the point of detonation.')
('Renne', "While still theoretical, it's thought this radiation will<br/>cause horrible chronic damage to both organisms and<br/>the environment.")
('Feri', 'So, even just being in the area could be<br/>dangerous, right?')
('Fie', 'Given all that, I can KIND of understand why the<br/>army would be mobilized to seal off the area.')
('Zin the Immovable', "Yeah, but we're talking about a village being blown<br/>away here. By our principles and for the sake of<br/>public safety, the guild can't ignore this.")
('Zin the Immovable', "That's why high-ranking bracers from all over the<br/>continent are starting to gather in Calvard.")
('Renne', 'On top of many A and B-ranks, word has it the head<br/>branch in Leman is considering sending an S-rank<br/>as well.')
('Van', "Pullin' out the big guns and putting them in<br/>charge, huh?")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Actually, no.')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Those of us already here will go after Almata while<br/>the newcomers cover the capital and other areas<br/>in need.')
('Fie', 'I may even call in some personal backup.')
('Fie', 'Well, I say that, but knowing them, they may already<br/>be on their way.')
('Van', 'Oh?')
('Aaron', "Hmm.<br/>(Must be the...whatever they're called from<br/>the Empire.)")
('Agnès', "By the way, I noticed Elaine isn't here. Is she out on<br/>another job?")
('Zin the Immovable', "Yeah. The idea's to handle as much work as we can<br/>before we dedicate ourselves to rooting out Almata.")
('Zin the Immovable', "So she's handling some stuff elsewhere in the capital<br/>right now.")
('Fie', "I'm a little worried about her, to be honest.")
('Van', '...Whaddaya mean?')
('Fie', 'Everyone was shocked by what happened to Creil,<br/>but Elaine seemed especially shaken.')
('Fie', 'She rushed out right after to start working and<br/>gathering information like a woman possessed.')
('Agnès', "That's disconcerting...")
('Van', '...')
('Zin the Immovable', "We've all been there on jobs plenty of times, so she's<br/>probably just rattled.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'But if you see her around, check in on her, all right?')
('Van', 'Will do.')
('Renne', "If I may, I'd like to address a certain elephant in<br/>the room...")
('Renne', "...or should I say the actress? You've snagged quite<br/>the famous employee.")
('Fie', "I'm surprised you can afford her day rate. Are you<br/>filming an advertisement for the office or something?")
('Judith', 'Wh-Who, me...? Oh, hello, everyone.<br/>(How did they see through me?!)')
('Judith', "Don't mind me. I'm more of a secretary than an<br/>assistant, anyway.")
('Agnès', 'I believe Risette has both those positions covered...')

('Van', "Don't mention it.")
('Van', "Anyway, we'll leave you to your work now.")
('Renne', 'Van, please wait.')
('Renne', 'Was that journalist a friend of yours?')
('Van', 'Yeah. Knew him for about five years.')
('Van', "I remember helpin' you two strike a deal half a year<br/>ago, come to think of it.")
('Renne', 'That you did. I worked with him many times, and<br/>truly owe him a lot.')
('Renne', 'The world lost a wonderful person.')
('Agnès', 'Renne...')
('Van', 'For now, all I can say is this.')
('Van', "We won't let the gifts he left us go to waste.<br/>No matter what.")

('Kopeyka', "I-I dunno, but I've gotta snap a pic of this!")

('Myna', 'M-Mommy!')
('Clarissa', "Let's hurry, Myna!")
('Van', 'Bah...')
('Shizuna', 'It looks like time has stopped in this area, too.')
('Feri', 'The effect extends this far, huh?')
('Fie', 'Yeah. There are a lot more people frozen here than in<br/>Old Town, too.')
('Aaron', "About as many as you'd expect for there being a<br/>festival going on, huh?")
('Kincaid', "Indeed. Though, it's not too surprising.")
('Feri', 'This area has been frozen, too...')
('Aaron', "About as many as you'd expect for there being a<br/>festival going on, huh?")
('Fie', "We should probably assume the whole city's the same<br/>at this point.")
('Kincaid', "It's safe to assume the entire city is in a similar state.")
('Van', "Here they come! And something's tellin' me they<br/>won't be as much of a pushover as the others.")
('Shizuna', "Heh. Looks like—these seem like they'll put up much<br/>more of a fight.")
('Feri', 'Evil spirits sighted!')
('Fie', "These look like they've been enhanced by a demon<br/>sphere, too!")
('Aaron', 'Here they come!')
('Kincaid', 'These look to have been enhanced by a demon<br/>sphere, too.')
('Aaron', 'Hah! Get outta here, losers!')
('Feri', 'O Arusha, grant us your protection!')
('Fie', "This'll be a breeze!")
('Kincaid', 'One minute will be more than sufficient for foes<br/>like you!')
('Van', "That takes care of 'em. What was up with those auras<br/>they had, though?")
('Shizuna', "I'm wondering the same thing. They were in a<br/>different league compared to the last batch.")
('Van', 'Whew... These things are still a real headache.')
('Feri', 'At least they were kinda small.')
('Aaron', "At least they're small time. Not like they're gonna<br/>give us much trouble.")
('Van', "The demon spheres're gonna have to buff 'em up a<br/>hell of a lot more than that if they want 'em to stand a<br/>chance against this crew.")
('Feri', 'Yeah!')
('Aaron', 'Heh. Damn right.')
('Van', 'Tch!')
('Shizuna', "They've got us surrounded!")
('Fie', "They've got us surrounded!")
('Kincaid', "They've got us surrounded!")
('Bracer Alvis', 'Haaah!')
('Van', "Nice timin'!")
('Fie', 'Thanks for the save!')
('Aaron', "Figures you're around these parts.")
('Professor Cronkite', 'They are not the only ones here, either.')
(40451, 'Fire!')
('Feri', "That's my brother's boss!")
('Shizuna', 'The general manager of Marduk paired with the<br/>genius professor.')
('Kincaid', 'Mr. Thorndyke and Professor Cronkite, is it?')
('Van', "And they're packin' some heat, too.")
('Van', "Hey, now. The heck're you doin'?")
('Bracer Alvis', 'Stay out of this, spriggan. Or wait... Are you on<br/>their side?')
('Fie', "Umm... I'm not following.")
('Bracer Lahad', "We've gotta get to the bottom of something,<br/>that's all.")
('Bracer Lahad', 'When all hell broke loose, we hurried out to help<br/>people ASAP.')
('Bracer Regina', 'Only to be greeted by these people already aiding in<br/>the evacuation efforts.')
('Bracer Regina', 'Which is fine in theory. But they were just too well<br/>prepared—like they knew all of this was going<br/>to happen.')
('Van', "I get'cha now.")
('General Manager Thorndyke', "I believe there's been a terrible<br/>misunderstanding here.")
('General Manager Thorndyke', "It's purely coincidental that my men and I happen to<br/>be here.")
('Bracer Gray', "Y-You can't honestly expect us to believe that!")
('Bracer Gray', "We SAW you with one of Heiyue's leaders!<br/>That makes you even more suspicious!")
('Bracer Alvis', "And what's your excuse, Professor Cronkite? Why are<br/>you with them?")
('Professor Cronkite', 'Must I really explain my actions here?')
('Professor Cronkite', 'To understand the most unusual phenomenon that<br/>has taken place today, I enlisted help to investigate it.')
('Bracer Alvis', '...!')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', 'Are you fighting AGAIN?!')
('Kincaid', 'There you are, Second Lieutenant.')
('Van', "Glad to see you're doin' okay, too, Professor.")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "It's a relief to see you in one piece, sir!")
('Van', "Glad to see you're both lookin' well.")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', 'The same to you.')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "I'm glad you're all okay, too!")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "I'm glad you're all okay, too!")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "We have no time for infighting—the safety of Edith's<br/>civilians should be priority number one.")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "If words won't convince you to stop, I'll be forced to<br/>exert the full authority of the CID. Understand?")
('Bracer Alvis', "Y-You've got to be joking!")
('Bracer Lahad', "I know we SHOULD be working together, but I just<br/>can't trust the likes of them.")
('General Manager Thorndyke', "Well, if the president wills it, we'll comply.")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "Th-That's not quite what I meant...")
('Fie', "...I think I see what's happening here now.")
('Kincaid', 'Hmm... I believe I understand the situation now.')
('General Manager Thorndyke', 'Seeing as Mr. Arkride has only just arrived, perhaps it<br/>would be wise to recount the details in more depth.')
('General Manager Thorndyke', 'Come along...Alvis, was it? We can continue this<br/>conversation in the café.')
('Bracer Alvis', "Sure, that's fine by me...but who put you in charge?!")
('System', 'They entered the café and listened as everyone<br/>relayed what they knew of the situation.')
('System', 'Their experiences mirrored each other—a strange call<br/>followed by the city and sky changing ominously, and<br/>most people being frozen in time.')
('System', 'They entered the café and listened as everyone<br/>relayed what they knew of the situation.')
('System', 'They also learned where Risette and Naje, who had<br/>been with the second lieutenant and Esmeray,<br/>were now.')
('Van', "So Naje went out lookin' for the crown prince...")
('Van', "...and Risette is investigating with Cao to learn more<br/>about what's happening.")
('Feri', "It sounds like they've got their eyes set on the demon<br/>spheres just like us.")
('Aaron', "Sounds like they're after the demon spheres, too.")
('Aaron', 'No clue why Cao would be helping out, though.')
('Shizuna', "I'm curious about that strange sphere that appeared in<br/>the sky and then disappeared, too.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "That's right. Naje seemed to feel really bad about<br/>leaving, but the prince is her number one priority.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "Hooonestly, I can't blame her.")
('General Manager Thorndyke', 'As for Miss Twinings, she is technically still under<br/>your employ.')
('General Manager Thorndyke', 'I believe that is why she wished to investigate, so I<br/>granted her request.')
('General Manager Thorndyke', 'Of course, the White Orchid Dragon has his<br/>motives—not that I could hazard a guess as to what<br/>those are.')
('Professor Cronkite', 'Given his foresight, he no doubt wants to learn<br/>something about the current phenomenon.')
('Professor Cronkite', 'Talent like his is wasted on the likes of Heiyue...<br/>though perhaps such an environment is where he<br/>truly shines.')
('Bracer Alvis', 'Ugh... Why do we have to rely on weapon designers,<br/>PMCs, and criminals?')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "I'm currently working on contacting police officers<br/>and CID affiliates who haven't been frozen.")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "Between that effort and assisting civilians in need,<br/>I haven't been able to help investigate at all—<br/>as frustrating as that is.")
('Bracer Alvis', "We're in the same boat, really. This should be a<br/>situation where the guild can shine, but we still can't<br/>help much.")
('Bracer Alvis', 'Ugh. If only Elaine or Zin were here...')
('Fie', "No kidding. At the least, I'm sure they're both okay,<br/>wherever they are.")
('Van', "Either way, if one of my employees is hittin' the<br/>pavement, I've gotta go back 'em up.")
('Van', 'Leave Risette to us, and focus on your own stuff.')
('Shizuna', 'Count me in.')
('Feri', "We've got this!")
('Aaron', 'Something tells me the super maid and Cao are<br/>doing a-okay on their own, though.')
('Kincaid', 'I will continue my operation with them. This area is<br/>in your hands, Lieutenant.')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', 'Yes, sir!')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "Thanks. I'm counting on you all.")
('Bracer Alvis', "I'll make my way back to the guild. I don't think we<br/>can afford to have anyone standing around right now.")
('Bracer Alvis', "I'm counting on you, everyone!")
('Fie', 'Leave it to us.')
('Bracer Alvis', "I'm counting on you, Arkride!")
('Van', 'No problem. Good luck with everything on your end.')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'Please do what you can for Risette!')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'Please do what you can for Risette!')
('General Manager Thorndyke', 'Best of luck and fair travels.')
('General Manager Thorndyke', "I'll be returning to the department store, what of<br/>you, Professor?")
('Professor Cronkite', 'Since I find myself in a café, I intend on resting here<br/>for a short while before returning to work.')
('Bracer Alvis', 'Oh!')
('Bracer Regina', "The air's clearing!")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', 'They did it!')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'Heehee. Van and his friends are always so reliable!')
('General Manager Thorndyke', 'Well, that settles that. Though I must say, Professor,<br/>your theory is most fascinating.')
('Professor Cronkite', 'It has the capacity to be fascinating, but at present it<br/>is merely a hypothesis. The truth of the matter will<br/>only become clear with time.')
('System', 'They returned to the orbal café to report back to<br/>Second Lieutenant Kaela, and to discuss their<br/>next move.')
('General Manager Thorndyke', 'So you wish to continue working with Arkride<br/>Solutions for the time being, then?')
('Risette', 'I do. While I am aware that our chief of security and<br/>yourself have goals of your own in this situation...')
('Risette', '...I do not believe my return would significantly<br/>contribute to furthering those goals.')
('Risette', "As such, I believe that continuing as I am will best<br/>serve Marduk's interests.")
('Risette', 'So I ask that you allow me to continue on with<br/>the solutions office as I have been.')
('Van', '...')
('Aaron', 'Heh.')
('Feri', 'Risette...')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'Heehee...')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', '...')
('General Manager Thorndyke', 'For the record, I had fully intended on approving<br/>your decision without the rousing speech.')
('General Manager Thorndyke', 'Very well. We at Marduk consider fairness to be one<br/>of our guiding principles.')
('General Manager Thorndyke', 'Go ahead and show us just how much value you can<br/>bring to the table.')
('Risette', 'Thank you, sir. I shall.')
('Cao', 'Hmm... So when do we begin the bidding for who<br/>can loan her next?')
('Van', "Hey! We're tryin' to have a serious discussion here!")
('Aaron', "Save your breath, that guy's never gonna change.")
('Cao', 'I was being half serious, at least.')
('Cao', "Regardless, since we happen to be together, I'd like to<br/>travel with you all for a while longer.")
('Cao', "I am concerned about Lady Ashen's well-being, as<br/>well as some notable others.")
('Cao', 'I am relieved to know that Lady Ashen is well, but<br/>there are some other notable individuals I remain<br/>concerned about.')
('Aaron', 'Oh, right. Fan and Gien are in the capital right now,<br/>too, yeah?')
('Van', "*sigh* Can't say I'm all that thrilled about havin' you<br/>of all people covering our backs.")
('Van', "...But you did help one of my people, so I'll put up<br/>with it this time. Welcome to the team.")
('Cao', 'Splendid. It always pays to put others in your debt<br/>when the opportunity presents!')
('Van', "I knew the catch was comin'!")
('Feri', '(Heehee.)')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', '(They go together surprisingly well.)')
('Risette', "(Indeed. Such are Mr. Arkride's charms.)")
('Shizuna', "Maybe it's time we part ways.")
('Shizuna', "If you've got the White Orchid Dragon on your side,<br/>you hardly need me.")
('Van', "Makes sense. Thanks for all the help you've given us.")
('Shizuna', 'Not at all. Hanging out with you helped me get a<br/>better handle on the situation, so it worked out for<br/>both of us.')
('Shizuna', "I'm going to meet up with Kurogane and the others,<br/>so if we learn anything, we'll give you a heads up.")
('Fie', "Heehee. In that case, I think I'll be off.")
('Fie', "Once I've traded info with the others bracers, I want<br/>to check on the situation around the rest of the city.")
('Bracer Alvis', "We'd really appreciate that, Fie.")
('Van', "Makes sense. Thanks for helpin' out all this time.")
('Van', "We'll let you know if we learn anything new.")
('Feri', 'Thank you so much, Fie. It was fun<br/>working together!')
('Fie', 'Haha. Same to you.')
('Fie', "As soon as I find Elaine, I'll be sure to let her know<br/>you're all right.")
('Van', 'Thanks, I guess.')
('Kincaid', 'Hmm... In that case, this seems a good time for me to<br/>take my leave.')
('Kincaid', 'I do have other duties to attend to after all.')
('Van', "Can't say I'm surprised. Just try not to die out<br/>there, buddy.")
('Kincaid', 'I could say the same to you.')
('Kincaid', 'Lieutenant, Mr. Thorndyke, Professor Cronkite.')
('Kincaid', "While I'm here, I'd like to exchange information.")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', 'Understood!')

('Van', 'Bah. Really?')
('Aaron', 'Makes sense, but damn, that sucks.')
('Risette', 'We could likely still make the journey if we used back<br/>roads and the like, but it would be much slower.')
('Feri', "Isn't there another route that we could take?")
('Cao', 'I was about to suggest one, actually. What say you to<br/>taking a detour through the Blacklight District?')
('Cao', 'Not only would it give us a route, but a number of<br/>skilled warriors are gathered there. It could give us<br/>extra strength going forward.')
('Van', "That's not a bad idea, actually.")
('Van', "I think my master was there, too. It'd be a huge help<br/>to have him with us.")
('Aaron', 'Yeah, he is one damn strong dude.')
('Risette', 'We may be able to resupply there as well.')
('Van', 'All right. Best way to the Blacklight District from<br/>here is that secret entrance in Riverside.')
('Van', "But there's no way to be sure the route there'll be safe,<br/>so better make sure we're prepared before headin' off.")
('Feri', 'Roger that!')
('Cao', 'Then let us be off.')
('System', 'To advance the main story, go to the underground<br/>entrance in the northern part of Riverside.')
('Van', '(Hmm... Now where should we go next?)')

('Agnès', "Th-That's a lot of money...")
('Agnès', "(It's the same amount of mira I pooled together to<br/>pay Van at first...)")
('Agnès', 'He could buy a precious gemstone with that<br/>much mira.')
('Van', "I hear photography's a real mira pit of a hobby if<br/>you're serious about it.")
('Van', "I'd rather sink 50,000 mira on car mods to be honest,<br/>but that's just me.")
('Agnès', "(I take it he's some sort of a car buff?)")
('Agnès', 'Is it just me, or is he acting a little strange?')
('Agnès', "It's like he doesn't want to buy the camera to<br/>begin with.")
('Agnès', "And he wasn't even sure what camera model he<br/>wanted in the first place. He had it written down<br/>instead—like he's here for someone else.")
('Van', "Nah, that's botherin' me, too.")
('Van', "Thought it'd be an open and shut case, but guess not.")
('Van', "Oh, I think he's about to leave.")
('Isla', 'Thank you very much for your purchase! Please<br/>come again.')
('Van', "Let's tail him.")
('Agnès', 'Got it!')
('Daniel', "It's almost time for the meeting. I don't want to<br/>be late!")
('Agnès', 'He rushed off in the direction of the<br/>department store.')
('Van', "Somethin' here definitely smells.")
('Van', "Wonder what's makin' him rush there right now.")
('Van', "I can think of a few possibilities, but let's just go after<br/>him for now.")
('Agnès', 'We lost him...')
('Agnès', "He's definitely in here somewhere, though.")
('Van', "Yeah. Didn't look like he noticed we were tailin' him,<br/>either, so I doubt he ran away.")
('Van', "Let's just look around and see if we can find him.")
('Agnès', 'Right!')
('Daniel', "I-I'm so sorry I kept you waiting!")
(40301, "Don't worry. You're right on time.")
('Van', "(Found him. That's his voice, all right.)")
(40301, 'So, how did it go?')
('Daniel', 'I bought it, no problem!')
('Daniel', 'This is the correct camera, right?')
(40301, '...Yes, it certainly is.')
(40301, 'Thank you for going out of your way to purchase it.')
(40301, 'As agreed, I will no longer be pressing charges about<br/>what happened.')
('Daniel', 'Oh, what a relief! Thank you so much!')
('Agnès', '(I wonder if this is the reason he stole that money<br/>from the cash register...)')
('Van', "(Sure looks like it. Somethin' seems real fishy about<br/>all of this.)")
('Van', "Sorry to rain on your parade, but you mind puttin'<br/>this deal on hold for a sec?")
('Daniel', '...?!')
(40301, "Wh-What's going on here?")
('Agnès', "We're from Arkride Solutions office. We work here<br/>in the capital.")
('Agnès', 'We were hired to investigate you, Daniel.')
('Daniel', 'What?! Wait, did Lott hire you?')
(40301, 'Hmm...')
('Van', "Don't worry. We're not here to stop you guys<br/>or anything.")
('Van', "We just want you to tell us a little about what's<br/>happenin' here. What's the story?")
('Van', "I know it's a lot to ask, but we need somethin' to<br/>report back to our client. 'S our job, after all.")
('Van', "And if you don't want 'em to know the full truth, we<br/>can help you out there, too.")
('Daniel', 'Damn it. Everything was going so well, too...')
('Daniel', "But I guess it can't hurt to tell you, since you're<br/>willing to keep this all a secret...")
('Daniel', "I don't want to cause you any more trouble, so do you<br/>mind if I do the talking?")
(40301, "Very well. I can see we aren't getting out of this<br/>without telling them the truth, so if you would.")
('Daniel', 'Well, this is all my fault, really.')
('Daniel', 'Two days ago, I was riding my bike to work<br/>as always.')
('Daniel', 'But the road I usually take was really busy, so I<br/>decided to take the next one over instead.')
('Daniel', 'Just as I was exiting it, though, I rode right into this<br/>man here.')
('Daniel', "Fortunately he wasn't badly harmed, but his camera<br/>was totally ruined.")
('Agnès', 'So you got into an accident.')
('Daniel', "*sigh* Basically, yeah. I'm lucky it was this man and<br/>not someone else, though.")
('Daniel', "He said ordinarily he'd be well within his rights to<br/>turn me over to the police and sue me for damages.")
('Daniel', 'But he was willing to let bygones be bygones as long<br/>as I compensated him for the camera.')
('Daniel', "I-I didn't have any money, so getting sued would<br/>cause a lot of trouble for both me and my family...")
('Daniel', 'So I did whatever I could to claw it together with the<br/>intention of paying it back later.')
('Van', 'Then you used that money to buy a new one?')
('Van', "I see. I think I know what's going on now.")
(40301, "*sigh* I'm glad to hear that. I don't like being treated<br/>like some kind of criminal just for being a decent<br/>human being.")
('Van', 'Still, you mind if I check just one thing?')
('Daniel', 'What do you mean?')
('Van', 'Can you show me the broken camera that started<br/>all this?')
(40301, 'What would that achieve?')
(40301, "It's the exact same model that young Daniel<br/>here purchased. Of that I'm certain.")
(40301, "I gave him a note with the exact model name on it, so<br/>I'm certain he bought the right one.")
('Van', "Oh, I don't doubt that. But you could be lyin' about<br/>which model was broken in the first place.")
('Van', 'The only way we can be sure this is all fair and above<br/>board is to see it.')
('Daniel', 'Wh-What do you mean?')
('Agnès', 'Oh!')
('Agnès', "You're saying he could be taking advantage of this to<br/>make Daniel buy him a more expensive camera than<br/>the one that he damaged?")
('Agnès', "So that's why we need to check that they're the same.")
('Daniel', "I can't believe that's true. I rode into him out of<br/>nowhere—he wouldn't have had time to come up<br/>with a lie like that.")
('Van', "You're naïve, kid. Ever heard of a mock-up?")
('Van', "It's a product replica that's equipped with just the<br/>bare minimum functions so you can test how it feels<br/>to use.")
('Van', "There's a few scammers goin' around using those to<br/>get people to buy them the real thing.")
('Van', "Like as compensation for an accident they<br/>deliberately caused by runnin' into their victim,<br/>for example.")
('Daniel', "W-Wait, you're not suggesting...")
(40301, "That's quite an accusation you're making there.")
(40301, "I don't have a habit of carrying around broken items,<br/>so I'm afraid I can't prove anything right now.")
(40301, "Besides, you've got nothing to do with any of this.<br/>You've no right to order me around.")
('Van', "I ain't orderin' you around.")
('Van', "But I can't just sit back and let this poor guy get<br/>swindled out of a lot of mira just 'cause he didn't<br/>know any better.")
('Van', "Nothin' wrong with opening his eyes up a little.")
('Daniel', 'Umm... I realize how inappropriate this is coming<br/>from me, since the accident was my fault<br/>and everything...')
('Daniel', "But would it be possible to see the broken camera<br/>after all? Later, I mean. Doesn't have to be now.")
(40301, 'Ugh... What basis do you have for trying to pin this<br/>on me?!')
(40301, 'I can see that giving you a chance to settle this out of<br/>the courts was a mistake!')
('Agnès', 'I do realize just how rude we must sound to you.')
('Agnès', "We just want a reason to believe your story.<br/>Please, won't you give us one?")
(40301, "Why?! I'm the victim here! Why am I supposed to be<br/>doing the legwork here?")
('Van', "*sigh* All right, if bein' nice won't do it here, guess<br/>it's time to shift gears a little.")
('Van', "If you give up on the camera and leave this guy alone,<br/>we'll let you go.")
('Van', "But you won't be so lucky if you try and pull this<br/>shit again.")
(40301, '...')
(40301, 'Haha... Hahaha!')
(40301, "Bah. I would've gotten away with it if you hadn't<br/>come along, asshole.")
(40301, "Oh, what a joke this is. I've had enough.")
(40301, 'Here you go. Take your damn camera.')
('System', 'The man returned the camera to Daniel.')
('Daniel', 'Wh-What?!')
(40301, '*sigh* Man, what a shitshow.')
(40301, "You two better watch it. If I come across this<br/>solutions office of yours again, I'm going to put you in<br/>your damn place.")
(40301, "I'll show you exactly what I mean if I ever have the<br/>displeasure of seeing you again.")
('Daniel', 'Th-Then it really was just a setup?')
('Van', 'Sure was.')
('Agnès', 'It was like he turned into a whole different person...<br/>It took me by surprise.')
('Agnès', "Still, this is the best outcome for you, isn't it?<br/>Now you don't need to give away the camera after all!")
('Van', 'Just so you know, we know you took money from the<br/>cash register at your job to buy it.')
('Van', "You only just bought the thing, so I'm sure the shop'll<br/>let you return it—if that's what you wanna do,<br/>at least.")
('Daniel', '...!')
('Daniel', "Haha... It's like I'm dreaming...")
('Daniel', 'I was going to return the money as soon as I could...')
('Daniel', "I didn't even want to take it in the first place...<br/>Guess I have the option of just refunding the camera<br/>and returning it ASAP.")
('Agnès', "I think that's the best course of action.")
('Van', "How're you plannin' to put it back?")
('Daniel', "That's...a good question.")
('Van', "Well, way I see it, you've got two options here.")
('Van', 'You can explain what happened to your boss and<br/>return the mira in person.')
('Van', "I can't guarantee you're not gonna get fired on<br/>the spot, but you can at least square up about it.")
('Van', "What you did wasn't right, but you were being<br/>exploited by a criminal. Hopefully they'll go easy on<br/>you if they know that.")
('Daniel', '...')
('Van', "Your other option's to slip the money back without<br/>tellin' anyone.")
('Van', "Sounds like your friend's already coverin' for you, so I<br/>doubt any discrepancy in their numbers is gonna get<br/>traced right back to you.")
('Van', "You'll get to keep your job and everything, but no<br/>promises your conscience will be clean after the fact.")
('Agnès', "Personally, I feel like it'd be best if you owned up to<br/>your mistake...")
('Daniel', '...What do you think I should do?')
('Van', 'What do I think? Well...')
('Van', 'My take on things is that it was a bad thing, but not<br/>the end of the world.')
('Van', "I'd just own up to it and try to move past it if I<br/>was you.")
('Van', 'Especially if you feel like the guilt is gonna eat at you<br/>after the fact.')
('Daniel', "Yeah... Yeah, I think you're right.")
('Agnès', 'Then...')
('Daniel', "Yeah, I'm gonna tell my boss about it.")
('Daniel', "Last thing I want is to drag Lott into this. I couldn't<br/>stand it if they find out the money's gone and blame<br/>him for covering for me.")
('Daniel', "I'd rather own up to my mistakes and move on, even<br/>if I have to face the consequences of my actions.")
('Agnès', "I think you're doing the right thing. I'm rooting<br/>for you.")
('Van', "I don't think you need to make a mountain out of a<br/>molehill over a small lapse of judgment, as long as you<br/>make it right.")
('Van', "'Specially if it could end up costing you your job or<br/>tarnishin' your reputation. Honesty ain't always the<br/>best policy.")
('Daniel', "Yeah... Yeah, I think you're right.")
('Agnès', 'Then...')
('Daniel', "Yeah. Sorry, but I'm gonna return the money and stay<br/>quiet about the whole thing.")
('Daniel', "I'll consider myself fortunate and take this as a<br/>learning experience.")
('Van', "You do you, man. It's your life to take or screw up.")
('Daniel', "By the way, I'm not wrong in assuming Lott was the<br/>one who hired you two?")
('Agnès', 'Umm, yes. That would be right.')
('Agnès', 'He happened to see you taking that money from the<br/>cash register and was worried about you.')
('Daniel', "Damn it. I had a feeling he'd seen me doing it.")
('Daniel', 'Are you guys okay with me paying you instead<br/>of him?')
('Van', 'As long as you run things by him, sure. Oh, and no<br/>stolen mira either.')
('Daniel', 'That goes without saying, haha.')
('Daniel', "I didn't cover the full amount with stolen mira<br/>anyway. 20,000 came from my own pocket.")
('Daniel', "I'll still have that left even after I return what I stole.")
('Van', "Glad to hear it. Wire the money when you're<br/>set, then.")
('Daniel', "Will do. And I'll go and apologize to Lott about the<br/>whole thing, too.")
('Daniel', 'I also need to thank him for hiring you.')
('Daniel', 'You really saved me today. Thank you so much.')
('System', 'Quest Friendly Felon completed!')
('System', 'Received')
('Van', "We're done with Station Street now.")
('Van', "Well, save for lookin' at the bulletin board.")
('Van', "It's on the right hand side of the station's<br/>main entrance. C'mon.")
('Van', "Let's check the board again and get to our next job.")
('Agnès', 'Got it!')
('Van', "This is where we're pickin' up that case for the<br/>courier job.")
('Agnès', 'Right.')
('Agnès', 'The job description mentioned that other people<br/>might try to stop us from seeing the job through, too.')
('Agnès', 'We should be paying careful attention to our<br/>surroundings, then.')
('Van', "Right on. Now, let's go in.")
('Agnès', "Erm... I'm sorry, but something is still bothering me<br/>about this job.")
('Agnès', 'Everything about it seems so suspicious... Are you<br/>really taking the job?')
('Agnès', 'And what do the number and letter in the job<br/>description even mean? 13-I?')
('Van', "Don't worry about the number, but the I is the<br/>recipient's initial. I know who it is, and I trust 'em.")
('Van', "Never met 'em in person, of course, but they got quite<br/>the rep in the criminal world as a goody-two-shoes.")
('Van', "That case isn't gonna have bombs or drugs or<br/>anything super shady, so don't worry about that.")
('Van', "Our job's just makin' sure it gets to its<br/>destination safely.")
('Agnès', "...All right. If you're that certain about this, I will say<br/>no more.")
('Agnès', 'We should head on inside, then.')
('Agnès', 'We need to pick up the item inside the station, right?')
('Agnès', 'Should we head on inside now, then?')
('Detective Nate', 'Ahem. Can I have a minute, you two?')
('Detective Nate', "What've you got there?")
('Agnès', '...?!')
('Van', "Oh, look who it is. You're the guy who was with<br/>that inspector the other day.")
('Detective Nate', "This 'guy' has a name. It's Nate. Not like I care if you<br/>remember or not.")
('Detective Nate', "Wait... You were the ones who set that reporter on<br/>us, weren't you?!")
('Detective Nate', "She ended up causing a huge commotion in the<br/>station because she wouldn't leave us alone!")
('Van', "Damn, sounds rough, buddy. Not sure what it's got to<br/>do with me, though.")
('Detective Nate', 'Grr... You really know how to rub someone the<br/>wrong way!')
('Detective Nate', "You said your name was Agnès, right? I'd stay away<br/>from shady characters like him if I was you.")
('Agnès', "Ahaha... I appreciate your concern, but I'm<br/>perfectly fine.")
('Agnès', "I'm currently working for him as a part-time<br/>employee, actually.")
('Detective Nate', 'Wh-What?!')
('Detective Nate', "Now that's something you should REALLY<br/>reconsider! If there's something you need to talk<br/>to somebody about, I can totally listen!")
('Van', "Look, man, I don't care if you're looking for a<br/>hookup, but don't do it in broad daylight.")
('Van', "We're busy people, y'know.")
('Detective Nate', "Wh-Wha...? Wait! I'm not finished with you yet!")
('Detective Nate', "I don't care about you! I care about that case you<br/>have there!")
('Van', "Why? Am I breakin' some sort of law I don't<br/>know of?")
('Detective Nate', "In case you didn't know, train stations are ideal<br/>targets for criminals.")
('Detective Nate', "Whether it's stealing, groping, or some kind of shady<br/>deal, crimes are way easier to commit with a lot of<br/>people around.")
('Detective Nate', "So if I see a shady character like you walking out with<br/>a suspicious looking briefcase, that's a double<br/>whammy of dubiousness.")
('Detective Nate', "That's too suspicious to just let you go like that!")
('Agnès', "Umm, that sounds more like you're relying on instinct<br/>than any concrete evidence.")
('Agnès', "I'm sorry, but I don't think it's very fair to treat people<br/>like suspected criminals without good reason.")
('Detective Nate', "I'm not suspecting you of anything, Agnès! This guy<br/>here's the problem!")
('Detective Nate', "Now hurry up and show me what's in that case!<br/>You'll be free to go after that. As long as there's<br/>nothing illegal, of course.")
('Agnès', 'Umm...')
('Van', "You know I can just decline to havin' my private<br/>property searched, yeah?")
('Van', "I don't gotta show you anything if I don't wanna.")
('Van', "If you're really dyin' to see what I got here, you're<br/>gonna need a search warrant. We'll talk then.")
('Detective Nate', 'The nerve of you, I swear!')
('Detective Nate', "Now I'm even MORE curious what you've got in<br/>that thing!")
('Agnès', "(He's really not making this easy for us, is he?)")
('Van', "*sigh* Fine. Just 'cause it's you, I'll do you a solid and<br/>tell you what's in it.")
('Van', "Bunch'a Crossbell Hot Shots.")
('Van', 'We got a client who wanted a huge chunk of their<br/>back catalog imported.')
('Agnès', "Umm... What's a hot shot?")
('Van', "*sigh* Do I really have to explain it? You know what<br/>I'm talkin' about, right?")
('Detective Nate', "...I'm guessing it's some sort of magazine featuring<br/>pictures of women.")
('Detective Nate', "Not like I would know! I've never seen or read them!")
('Agnès', 'I-I see...')
('Van', "Not gonna lie, I'd much rather not go broadcastin' my<br/>client's fetishes to the cops...")
('Van', 'But if you really insist, fine. You can look as much as<br/>you want.')
('Van', "Don't worry, we'll gladly keep guard while you're<br/>enjoyin' yourself.")
('Agnès', "We've got no choice, huh? We can't risk him running<br/>off with them.")
('Detective Nate', 'Wh-Why are you looking at me like that?! Stop it!')
('Van', 'Aww, no need to be shy. Hell, I can even get some<br/>extras next time we import a batch, just for you.')
('Detective Nate', 'Fine! Fine!')
('Detective Nate', "Just stop talking before you make Agnès think I'm<br/>some kind of pervert!")
('Detective Nate', "Okay, okay... I admit it, you're right. I don't have any<br/>hard evidence to suspect you of anything.")
('Detective Nate', "I'm not sure if there's actually magazines in that<br/>thing, but let's just say I believe you for now and let<br/>you go.")
('Van', 'You sure? Would make things easier on us if you did.')
('Detective Nate', "Hmph. Just so we're clear, I'm not doing this for you.")
('Detective Nate', "It's for Agnès' sake—and my honor.")
('Agnès', 'Ahaha... Thank you very much.')
('Van', "We'll get goin', then.")
('Detective Nate', "*sigh* That Arkride Solutions guy's not to be trusted.")
('Detective Nate', "I'm going to have to keep an eye on him. Though I<br/>wish I could trust Agnès' judgment here...")
('Agnès', "Whew... We're finally away from him.")
('Van', 'Yeah. Dude caught me off guard there.')
('Van', "Dunno if he's got great instincts or if that was just<br/>some dumb luck.")
('Agnès', "Just to be sure, the case isn't actually full of men's<br/>magazines, right?")
('Van', "Course not. No one's gonna go through all this<br/>trouble for something like that.")
('Van', "We got sidetracked enough. Let's get back to getting<br/>this thing to the drop off point.")
('Agnès', 'Okay.')
('Agnès', 'Let me check the note again, just to be sure.')
('Agnès', 'The drop off point is on the north side of the<br/>Riverside District.')
('Van', 'Must be at the end of the path on the left of<br/>the temple.')
('Van', "All right, let's get going. And keep your eyes peeled<br/>for trouble.")
('Agnès', 'Understood!')
('Van', "Guess you won't really know when we're there, but<br/>I will.")
('Van', 'So just stick with me. And keep your eyes peeled<br/>for trouble.')
('Agnès', 'Understood!')
('Agnès', '(We thankfully managed to avoid getting searched<br/>by Nate...)')
('Agnès', "(But I can't deny I'm rather curious myself about<br/>what's in the case.)")
('Roderick', 'Could you guys be...?')
('Van', "We're from Arkride Solutions.")
('Van', "You're Roderick, I take it?")
('Roderick', "That's right.")
('Roderick', "I'm the only survivor of the terrorist attack you've<br/>been investigating, though I was only a kid at<br/>the time.")
('Van', 'Let me start by giving you this locket back, then.')
('System', 'Van handed the locket over to Roderick.')
('Roderick', "Thank you very much. I'll be sure to treasure it.")
('Roderick', "I take it you're the one that had it this whole time?")
('Van', "Yeah. His name's Bruno.")
('Van', "He's the man who stole it from the hotel you were<br/>staying at twenty years ago.")
('Bruno', '...')
('Roderick', "Then you're the thief who just so happened to target<br/>our room the same day those terrorists came for us...")
('Bruno', "Heard you told the police that you didn't remember<br/>anything at the time.")
('Bruno', "I thought you'd have forgotten me.")
('Roderick', 'Oh, I would never forget you.')
('Bruno', 'Then why did you cover for me?!')
('Bruno', "...No. I suppose it doesn't matter at this point.")
('Bruno', "I'm... I'm sorry. I may not have been the man that<br/>killed your parents, but I still let 'em die.")
('Bruno', "If you want revenge, I'll take it. You can even turn me<br/>in to the cops if you want. I won't resist.")
('Van', '...')
('Agnès', 'Bruno...')
('Feri', '...')
('Aaron', '...')
('Roderick', '...Bruno.')
('Roderick', "For twenty years, I've wanted to meet you. For twenty<br/>years, I wanted to say something to you.")
('Roderick', 'Thank you. Thank you for saving my life.')
('Bruno', 'Wh-What?!')
('Roderick', "When I woke up that night, the first thing I saw was<br/>two men standing by my parents' bed.")
('Roderick', "Both of them drenched in blood. It was too late for<br/>my parents. I was so scared that I couldn't move.")
('Roderick', "It would've been too late for me, too, if you hadn't<br/>appeared then.")
('Bruno', '...')
('Roderick', "You didn't hesitate. You looked me in the eyes and<br/>immediately took my hand and led me out of<br/>the room.")
('Roderick', "I'll admit I noticed you pocketing Mom's locket as<br/>you did.")
('Agnès', "(I guess he wasn't willing to pass up on<br/>the opportunity.)")
('Feri', '(He was still a thief at the end of the day...)')
('Aaron', "(Heh. Came to loot the place and wasn't gonna leave<br/>empty handed, huh?)")
('Roderick', 'But you still saved my life. You told me not to tell<br/>anyone about you after you left, and I listened.<br/>You were my hero. Still are.')
('Roderick', "That's why I never told the police or my relatives<br/>about you. You've been my secret this whole time.")
('Van', 'Tough nut to crack, huh?')
('Bruno', "You... You idiot! I'm no hero!")
('Bruno', "I just didn't think I was gonna chance on a murder<br/>scene and I led you away without even thinking<br/>about it!")
('Bruno', 'Then you had to go and thank me after that...<br/>You sounded so pitiful...')
('Bruno', "That one thing's continued to haunt me all<br/>these years!")
('Bruno', 'So I started making more and more mistakes, until I<br/>finally gave up thieving!')
('Roderick', "Really? I'm...very sorry about that.")
('Bruno', 'Bah! Get that smile off your face!')
('Bruno', "But...I guess that means it's thanks to you that I was<br/>able to change.")
('Bruno', 'I should be thanking you, not the other way around.')
('Roderick', 'Haha... It makes me genuinely happy to hear I was<br/>able to do something for you after everything you did<br/>for me.')
('Van', 'You sure are a piece of work, old man.')
('Agnès', 'Still, it sounds like this was a happy ending<br/>for everyone.')
('Feri', 'But that wraps that job up!')
('Aaron', "Man, that was corny as hell. But I guess it's not that<br/>bad to see that from time to time.")
('System', 'The party kept Bruno and Roderick company as the<br/>two of them talked for a while longer.')
('System', 'Eventually, they saw Roderick off, who—as much as<br/>he wished he could stay—was forced to leave for a<br/>business meeting.')
('Bruno', "Well, I'm gonna head off.")
('Bruno', "I'll make sure to wire you your money later.")
('Van', 'Cheers.')
('Bruno', '...')
('Bruno', 'Uhh... Listen, this is all thanks to you guys...')
('Van', "What's that? Can you say that again?")
('Bruno', 'Bah! Forget it! See ya!')
('Agnès', "Heehee. He's not one for being honest with his<br/>feelings, is he?")
('Feri', 'Not everyone can be honest with themselves!')
('Aaron', 'Dude needs to learn to speak his heart more.')
('Van', "You're right about that one.")
('System', 'After Bruno departed, Van contacted editor-in-chief<br/>Sullivan to update her on what happened.')
('System', 'She concluded that there was no reason to publish<br/>what they had learned as there were no threats to<br/>the public.')
('System', 'And so it was that, unbeknownst to the world, the story<br/>of the former thief and the locket he stole came to a<br/>happy end.')
('System', 'Quest Change of Heart completed!')
('System', 'Received')
('Roderick', 'Could you guys be...?')
('Van', "We're from Arkride Solutions.")
('Van', "You're Roderick, I take it?")
('Roderick', "That's right.")
('Roderick', "I'm the only survivor of the terrorist attack you've<br/>been investigating, though I was only a kid at<br/>the time.")
('Van', 'Let me start by giving you this locket back, then.')
('System', 'Van handed the locket over to Roderick.')
('Roderick', "Thank you very much. I'll be sure to treasure it.")
('Roderick', "I take it you're the one that had it this whole time?")
('Van', "Yeah. His name's Bruno.")
('Van', "He bought it on the black market, and has been tryin'<br/>to get it back to its rightful owner.")
('Van', "Don't go gettin' the wrong idea. He didn't actually<br/>steal it from you.")
('Bruno', '...')
('Roderick', "I...see... That's a shame.")
('Bruno', 'What do you mean?')
('Roderick', "I've been wanting to meet the man who stole it for<br/>twenty years now, so that I could thank him.")
('Bruno', 'Th-Thank him?!')
('Bruno', 'Why the hell would you wanna thank the thief that<br/>took advantage of you in the middle of a<br/>terrorist attack?!')
('Roderick', "Haha. I'm not gonna deny that that's what he did.")
('Roderick', "But he also saved my life. He's a hero to me.")
('Van', "Never heard someone call a thief their hero, but I<br/>guess there's a first time for everything.")
('Roderick', "When I woke up that night, the first thing I saw was<br/>two men standing by my parents' bed.")
('Roderick', "Both of them drenched in blood. It was too late for<br/>my parents. I was so scared that I couldn't move.")
('Roderick', "And that's when this old man showed up. A<br/>thief, really.")
('Bruno', '...')
('Roderick', 'As soon as our eyes met, he took my hand and led me<br/>out of the room. No hesitation.')
('Roderick', "I'll admit that I noticed him pocketing Mom's locket<br/>as we ran.")
('Agnès', "(I guess he wasn't willing to pass up on<br/>the opportunity.)")
('Feri', '(He was still a thief at the end of the day...)')
('Aaron', "(Heh. Came to loot the place and wasn't gonna leave<br/>empty handed, huh?)")
('Roderick', "But he still saved my life. Regardless of everything,<br/>he's my hero. And, when he left, he asked me not to<br/>tell anyone about him.")
('Roderick', "So that's why I never told the police or my relatives<br/>about him. He's been my secret this whole time.")
('Van', "Gotta give it to you, man. You're loyal. Even to the<br/>man who stole your things.")
('Roderick', "To be fair to him, the locket's the only thing he took.")
('Bruno', "Don't be an idiot! 'The only thing he took'?!<br/>He shouldn't have taken anything at all! A piece of<br/>shit like that has no business being anyone's hero!")
('Bruno', "He probably just didn't think he was gonna chance on<br/>a murder scene and took you without thinking!")
('Roderick', "You know, maybe you're right. But that doesn't<br/>change the fact that he's the only reason I'm still<br/>here today.")
('Roderick', "I don't want to ask any more of you, but if you do<br/>ever find the man who stole it, could you give him a<br/>message from me?")
('Roderick', "Tell him, 'Thank you so much. You're still my hero to<br/>this very day.'")
('Van', 'Sure. If we just so happen to run into him.')
('Roderick', 'I appreciate it. Now... I think I should be going.')
('Roderick', 'Thank you again, sir.')
('Bruno', "...I've done nothing to deserve your thanks.")
('Van', '...You sure that was for the best?')
('Bruno', 'Yeah... Yeah, I am.')
('Bruno', "He grew up to be quite different from what I thought<br/>he'd be.")
('Bruno', "But an upright and honest young man like that<br/>shouldn't be bowing his head to criminal scum like<br/>me to begin with.")
('Van', 'If you say so.')
('Bruno', "I'll be on my way, then.")
('Bruno', "I'll make sure to wire you your money later.")
('Van', 'Thanks.')
('Bruno', '...')
('Bruno', 'I really owe you for what you did.')
('Van', 'Talk about a difficult old man.')
('Agnès', 'Heehee. Still, I suppose this is case closed.')
('Feri', 'But that wraps things up!')
('Aaron', "Hard agree. But, hey, at least the job's done.")
('System', 'After Bruno departed, Van contacted editor-in-chief<br/>Sullivan to update her on what happened.')
('System', 'She concluded that there was no reason to publish<br/>what they had learned as there were no threats to<br/>the public.')
('System', 'And so it was that, unbeknown to the world, the story<br/>of the former thief and the locket he stole came to a<br/>happy end.')
('System', 'Quest Change of Heart completed!')
('System', 'Received')
('Van', 'Are you Stephan? The guy that wrote that request?')
('Van', "We're with Arkride Solutions.")
('Stephan', 'You really came!')
('Stephan', "Oh, thank goodness. I was worried you wouldn't even<br/>see my request.")
('Risette', 'You mentioned worrying about the safety of<br/>your father?')
('Stephan', 'Yeah. He got himself caught up in a<br/>suspicious-sounding new religion.')
('Stephan', "What he chooses to believe is his own choice, of<br/>course—but I haven't been able to get in touch with<br/>him for some time now.")
('Stephan', "That's why I'd like you to try and find out if he's all<br/>right or not.")
('Van', "That's all? Don't want us to try and knock some sense<br/>into him?")
('Van', "Feel like that's what most people in your position<br/>would try to do.")
('Stephan', 'I have mixed feelings on the whole situation, to<br/>be honest. That religion in particular.')
('Stephan', "It hasn't been ALL bad on us, or him, really.")
('Stephan', "Have you heard about them? They're called<br/>Libra Domina.")
('Van', 'Never heard of it, no.')
('Agnès', 'Nor have I.')
('Stephan', 'Its fundamental beliefs are largely the same as those<br/>of the Septian Church. They worship Aidios, for one.')
('Stephan', "But, on top of that, it's also based heavily on the<br/>concept of karma—doing good deeds brings rewards,<br/>while bad ones do the opposite.")
('Feri', "It doesn't sound so bad to me...")
('Aaron', "Doesn't sound so bad, but what's the catch here?")
('Stephan', "As I said, it's actually done a lot of good for him.")
('Stephan', 'My father was kind of a terrible person before he<br/>joined them, you see.')
('Stephan', 'He refused to work, and would just spend all his time<br/>either gambling or drinking himself silly.')
('Stephan', "Mom got tired of it, and they eventually divorced.<br/>I didn't see him after that. Well, not until recently...")
('Stephan', 'When I finally met him again, it was like he was a<br/>totally different person. A friend of his apparently<br/>recommended he join the church, which he did.')
('Van', 'And the church put him back on the right track.')
('Stephan', 'Pretty much. He became a really hard worker and<br/>dropped both drinking and gambling.')
('Stephan', "He's shown regret for turning his back on his family<br/>at the time, too. I can't say it's all bad. I'm partly<br/>happy he joined, actually.")
('Stephan', "But I just can't shake this...anxiety I feel the more I<br/>hear about them.")
('Risette', 'What have you heard about them?')
('Stephan', 'Once people join the church, they start trying to<br/>convince anyone and everyone to join, too.')
('Stephan', "Recruiting more members is considered one of the<br/>good deeds I mentioned earlier, and it lets you...'level<br/>up' as a person.")
('Stephan', "I've heard that those who donate particularly large<br/>sums of mira are given special blessings by the<br/>religion's guru, too.")
('Stephan', "My father's hoping that if he does enough good<br/>deeds, he'll be able to bring our family back together.")
('Feri', "Nothing wrong with wanting to do good things, yeah,<br/>but I'm not too sure about the recruitment<br/>and donations.")
('Feri', 'The Arusha who I believe in has no interest in<br/>those things.')
('Aaron', "Can't blame you. That's shady as hell.")
('Agnès', "So that's why you're worried?")
('Stephan', "Yes. I mean, what if it's just the tip of the iceberg?<br/>What if there are worse things happening behind<br/>closed doors that I don't know about?")
('Stephan', 'So, could I ask you to go and check on him?')
('Van', 'Hmm... This really is a job more fit for us than the<br/>guild or the cops.')
('Van', '(What should we do? Should we take the job on<br/>right now?)')
('Stephan', "I'm really worried that something sinister is going on<br/>behind the scenes in the religion my father joined.")
('Stephan', "I haven't been able to get in touch with him for a<br/>while now, so I'd really appreciate it if you could at<br/>least check if he's okay.")
('Van', 'Hmm... This really is a job more fit for us than the<br/>guild or the cops.')
('Van', '(What should we do? Should we take the job on<br/>right now?)')
('Van', "You mind waitin' a bit? We'll take the job,<br/>don't worry.")
('Van', "We'll come back and let you know when we're ready<br/>to start investigatin'.")
('Stephan', 'I see... Of course. Just let me know, then.')
('Stephan', "I'll wait right here.")
('Van', "Sure. We'll take your job on.")
('Van', "With that settled, next step is figurin' out where to<br/>start lookin'.")
('Van', "You said a friend of your dad's the one that convinced<br/>him to join the church, yeah?")
('Stephan', "Yes, that's right. His name is Carson.")
('Stephan', "I remember hearing that he's usually in the Riverside<br/>District at this time of day.")
('Stephan', 'Around the terrace area specifically.')
('Stephan', 'I think most people that want to join the religion or<br/>have any sort of interest in it have to go through him.')
('Van', "Good start as any. All right, let's head to Riverside<br/>and see if we can find this Carson.")
('Van', 'Just leave the rest to us.')
('Agnès', "We'll let you know if we learn anything useful.")
('Stephan', 'Thank you! Good luck!')
('Risette', 'We should go ahead and make our way over to the<br/>terrace area of the Riverside District.')
('System', 'Quest New Religions started!')
('Risette', "So they've gone underground. It's quite the ideal<br/>place for any illicit activities if going undetected is<br/>your goal.")
('Van', "Let's get after 'em, or we're gonna lose 'em!")
('Feri', 'Right!')
('Aaron', "It's time to go settle this!")
('Stephan', "I'm so glad you're okay, Dad.")
('Stephan', "You look like you've lost a bit of weight since I last<br/>saw you, though.")
('Walton', 'Haha, maybe I did.')
('Walton', "I'm so sorry for worrying you, son.")
('Walton', 'I was just so desperate to get our family<br/>back together... The church gave me hope that I<br/>might, and I foolishly clung to it.')
('Walton', "After everything, I was led astray again. I'm<br/>so ashamed. I still have work to do to be the man I<br/>want to be.")
('Stephan', "If anything, it's good to see you being so honest<br/>with yourself.")
('Stephan', "Don't worry. I'll be here to support you through it<br/>all, Dad. We'll improve, together. No matter how<br/>long it takes...")
('Walton', 'Oh, Stephan... Thank you.')
('Agnès', "It's so nice seeing a happy ending.")
('Walton', "I really can't thank you enough.")
('Stephan', "Nor can I. I shudder to think what could've happened<br/>if you hadn't come in to help when you did.")
('Stephan', 'Thank you so, so much.')
('Van', "Don't mention it. Just doin' my job.")
('Risette', 'The guru and the artifact both have been lost.')
('Risette', "It's only a matter of time before the church itself falls<br/>apart, now that it lacks its leader.")
('Risette', "The guru and his accomplices have been arrested.<br/>I'm certain it's only a matter of time before the police<br/>dismantles the church itself.")
('Risette', 'And the police said they would help with the care<br/>of anyone feeling the shock of the events that<br/>just happened.')
('Feri', 'Now you can do your best not to cause any<br/>more trouble!')
('Aaron', "Now you can keep your head low and make sure you<br/>don't screw up that bad again.")
('Walton', "Oh, of course. You've got my word on that.")
('Stephan', "Well, I think it's about time we let you get back<br/>to work. Once more, thank you. And take care!")
('Van', 'Sure. Same to you.')
('System', 'Quest New Religions completed!')
('System', 'Received')
('Downey', 'The hell, man?! Who do those guys think<br/>they are?!')
('Hyades', "Chill it, Downey! I get how you feel, but shouting's<br/>doing nothing for us!")
('Junifer', "Oh, but I'm NOT lettin' them get away with this!<br/>Hell no! Not with our street racer pride on the line!")
('Graham', 'Seconded. We should take our chance while we can.')
('Van', "What's goin' on here?")
('Graham', 'Van!')
('Junifer', 'Guess I could let ya know.')
('Junifer', "There's this bunch of street racers causing trouble for<br/>us ever since they turned up in the capital.")
('Downey', "They're taunting us, I tell you! They drive like<br/>madmen around town just to get on our nerves!")
('Downey', 'I ran my car into a guardrail thanks to their<br/>dumb asses! Argh, just thinking about it gets me<br/>angry all over again!')
('Hyades', 'The hand-me-down I got from Downey got trashed<br/>real bad, too. Dude, she had to be sent to the<br/>body shop...')
('Hyades', 'How can we let loose and enjoy a sweet drive with<br/>them tearing it up around town?')
('Van', "Yeah, they sound pretty bad. Who're we dealin'<br/>with here?")
('Graham', "They call themselves the High Bloods. There's four<br/>of them, and they all come from Oración.")
('Graham', 'They used to stick to their turf, but they recently<br/>started moving here.')
('Graham', "They're all rich kids, obviously, and their cars are<br/>really souped up.")
('Junifer', "What's more, their leader Lucio is the grandson of<br/>ETWS' current company president.")
('Junifer', "He's got a modded ETWS sports car. Ain't no slouch<br/>as a driver, either.")
('Junifer', "Last we raced, he passed me by like I was just crawlin'<br/>through the street! Can you believe that?")
('Van', "Hol' up! You said it was the ETWS<br/>president's grandson?!")
('Van', "Man, that sucks. Last thing you need is someone<br/>related to the company's top brass being a dick.")
('Graham', "And he's not the worst of it.")
('Graham', "There's another guy that's an even more<br/>reckless driver.")
('Graham', "His name's Damian, and he styles himself as their<br/>main fighter.")
('Downey', "He's all cocky, taunting us from his bike just 'cause he<br/>can take tighter turns than any of our cars!")
('Downey', "He's the one that did my baby in! I'll never forgive<br/>that bastard. Never!")
('Van', "He thinks he's better than us car drivers, does he?")
('Van', "So, what're you planning to do about these guys?<br/>Surely you're not just gonna let 'em keep<br/>runnin' wild?")
('Graham', "Definitely not. We've tried warning them over and<br/>over to stop behaving like this, but it's fallen on<br/>deaf ears.")
('Graham', "Since they're not heeding warnings like that, I tried<br/>talking to Lucio directly.")
('Graham', "Only thing he said was, 'If you want us to leave, you'll<br/>have to best us in a race.'")
('Junifer', "We're actually on our way to the race right now.")
('Van', "Yeah? Guess my timing's just that good.")
('Graham', 'You could say that, haha.')
('Junifer', "There's four of them, but me 'n Graham are the only<br/>ones with rides right now.")
('Junifer', "And that's not even countin' car specs and<br/>driving ability... Hate to admit it, but it's stacked.<br/>And not in our favor.")
('Junifer', "But we can't just give up!")
('Graham', 'Yeah. Better to lose outright than to flake out on<br/>them and just lose by default.')
('Graham', "Not like we're hoping to lose, though! We're not<br/>backing down until they're in the ground!")
('Graham', 'Wish us luck.')
('Van', '(Hmm...)')
('Van', "(I don't wanna sit back and let a bunch of rich<br/>assholes wreak havoc in Edith.)")
('Van', "(Maybe I could lend 'em a hand here.)")
('Graham', 'Better to lose outright than to flake out on<br/>them and just lose by default.')
('Graham', "Not like we're hoping to lose, though! We're not<br/>backing down until they're in the ground!")
('Graham', 'Wish us luck.')
('Van', "(I don't wanna sit back and let a bunch of rich<br/>assholes wreak havoc in Edith.)")
('Van', "(Maybe I could lend 'em a hand here.)")
('Van', "(Right now's not really the time. Maybe if my<br/>schedule clears up a bit later.)")
('Van', 'You mind if I join?')
('Junifer', "I appreciate the sentiment, but this is our problem to<br/>deal with. Wouldn't be right to drag you into it.")
('Van', 'Hard disagree. This goes beyond just you. It involves<br/>all car lovers now.')
('Van', "As a fellow driver myself, I can't just stand back and<br/>let a bunch of punks with no sense for safe drivin'<br/>screw my home up.")
('Van', "I wanna teach 'em a lesson.")
('Junifer', 'Van...')
('Downey', "Haha! Now that's what we like to hear!")
('Hyades', "Don't see why he can't join. Why not let him?")
('Graham', "All right. Thanks, Van. You're really saving our<br/>asses here.")
('Graham', "You might honestly be the best help we could've got.<br/>I respect you a lot, man.")
('Van', "Thanks for sayin' so.")
('Van', "That still leaves the problem of dealin' with<br/>Damian, though.")
('Van', "I'm no biker, so I'm not gonna be able to help there.")
('Junifer', "Not so sure how we're gonna deal with that niggling<br/>little detail.")
('Hermès', "Whew. That's all for today, then. Now, back to<br/>my bike...")
('Hermès', '...Hmm?')
('Hermès', 'Why are all of you gathered here?')
('Van', 'Hermès!')
('Van', "Your timin' couldn't be any better. Got some free<br/>time on your hands?")
('Hermès', "Huh? I mean, I'm done for the day, so I guess I do.")
('Hermès', "I see. So you're going to be racing them to teach them<br/>a lesson?")
('Van', 'Yeah. Would really help if we had a biker of your skill<br/>level on our team.')
('Van', 'What do you say? You up for it?')
('Hermès', "Haha. Sure, I'll join your team.")
('Hermès', 'Teaching a naughty rider how to behave sounds<br/>like fun.')
('Hermès', "I'll make sure they think twice before causing trouble<br/>in the capital again!")
('Van', 'Glad to see you so fired up for this.')
('Graham', 'I really appreciate you agreeing, too. Now it feels like<br/>we have a fighting chance.')
('Junifer', "Yep! It's gonna be a proper four vs. four race! Now all<br/>that's left is leavin' them in the dust!")
('Junifer', "Anyway! Clock's tickin'! Let's get goin' to the<br/>meeting spot!")
('Junifer', 'You ready to go?')
('Hermès', 'Ready whenever you are.')
('Van', 'Same here.')
('Graham', "Then let's roll!")
('System', 'Quest Race in the Capital started!')
('Van', "'On the gateway to our fair capital lies a merchant<br/>whose store carries varieties for every man.'")
('Van', "That's gotta be the department store, yeah? But what<br/>am I supposed to do here?")
('Administrator Wesley', 'Might you happen to be Mr. Van Arkride, sir?')
('Van', "Huh? Yeah, that's me.")
('Administrator Wesley', 'I see, I see! ...Ahem!')
('Administrator Wesley', 'Congratulations, sir! You are precisely the 333rd<br/>customer to visit our store today!')
('Administrator Wesley', 'Allow me to present you with a gift in honor of<br/>this moment!')
('Van', 'S-Sure...?')
('Administrator Wesley', "It's an all-expenses-paid invitation to a bathing<br/>facility in Trion Tower.")
('Administrator Wesley', 'Massage included, too, so I believe it would be a fine<br/>way to rest away your weariness.')
('Van', "Wait, what?! Since when was it a thing to give out<br/>stuff this fancy just for wanderin' in at the right time?!")
('Administrator Wesley', 'Is it not to your liking, sir?')
('Van', "No, it ain't that. It sounds amazing, trust me.")
('Administrator Wesley', 'Haha. Then please accept it with our blessing.')
('Administrator Wesley', 'Allow me to give you this, too.')
('Van', 'Another riddle, huh?')
('System', "'Last task: Reach the place in the business district<br/>where three pillars stand and you can hear the<br/>rushing water. I'll await you there.'")
('Van', 'This is the last one, huh? Hmm...')
('Administrator Wesley', 'Well, I will leave you to enjoy the rest of<br/>your evening.')
('Van', "(That's two unexpected but awesome gifts I've<br/>got now.)")
('Van', "(What's my client's aim here? To put me in<br/>their debt? To get me to let my guard down?)")
('Van', '(Man, I still got no clue. But I guess I might as well<br/>see this through to the end.)')
('Van', "Are you Jess' manager?")
('Manager', "That's right.")
('Manager', "Never thought he'd up and disappear like that.<br/>And without saying anything to his housemates!")
('Van', 'What have you heard?')
('Manager', 'We were recently talking about his future. As an<br/>artist, I mean.')
('Manager', "I'm sure you heard about it already, but he missed his<br/>concert three days ago.")
('Manager', 'Got an earful from me, of course.')
('Manager', "All he said to me was that, 'things can't keep going<br/>like this.'")
('Van', 'Hmm...')
('Manager', 'He said he wanted to get away from his current<br/>environment and work someplace else.')
('Manager', 'Even mentioned trying to perform abroad.')
('Agnès', 'It could be a very rewarding challenge as a<br/>performer, yes...')
('Feri', "I can't blame him for wanting to try...")
('Aaron', 'Talk about wanting it tough.')
('Risette', "That's quite a courageous idea.")
('Quatre', 'I admire his courage on the matter, at least...')
('Judith', 'Not every artist has the guts to do that, I guess.')
('Bergard', "That's quite a courageous idea.")
('Manager', "Well, I said to forget about it for now. He's at a<br/>critical point in his career. Too critical to be<br/>going anywhere!")
('Manager', 'I told him straight up that he has no hope of<br/>succeeding if he just leaves the country now.')
('Manager', "His response? 'So be it. An early retirement might<br/>suit me, if it comes to it.'")
('Van', "He's awfully willing to throw everything away.")
('Manager', "However, I'm still his manager as of now.")
('Manager', "So he's obligated to inform me in case he does leave<br/>the capital. So far, he hasn't done that.")
('Manager', "Wherever he is, I trust it's still near the capital.")
('Van', "Thanks for the info. That's real useful.")
('Van', 'While I got you here, mind if I ask about anyone else<br/>that might know him?')
('Manager', "I don't know how much I can say on that end.<br/>He's always been a very private person.")
('Manager', 'But I do know he recently helped arrange the music<br/>for an idol duo.')
('Manager', "Seyla and Lulua, I think? They're the best I can give<br/>you when it comes to acquaintances.")
('Van', "Just knowin' that is a big help. We know the two of<br/>'em, so it should be easy to ask about him.")
('Manager', "I believe they're in the middle of a concert right now.")
('Manager', "It's over in the Blue Score, where Jess himself<br/>often performs.")
('Van', 'Ah, right.')
('Van', 'Thanks again.')
('Van', 'Thanks again.')
('Manager', "Don't mention it. I hope you can bring him to<br/>his senses.")
('Manager', 'Good luck.')
('Agnès', "Let's head to the Blue Score, then, so we can speak<br/>with the idols.")
('Feri', "What are we waiting for? Let's go talk to them!")
('Aaron', 'Next stop: Blue Score.')
('Risette', 'Let us be on our way, then.')
('Quatre', 'We should go and speak with the idol duo, then.')
('Judith', "All right! Let's go and talk to them!")
('Bergard', "Let's go and speak to those two idols, then.")
('Van', 'Yeah. Off to Riverside we go.')
('Van', 'Yeah. Off to Riverside we go.')
('Alicia', 'Oh! Are you...?')
('Van', "We're from Arkride Solutions.")
('Van', "I take it you're the client the guild referred to us?")
('Alicia', "Yes, that's right! My name's Alicia.")
('Alicia', "Shall we take a seat? I'll explain the job details to you.")
('Alicia', 'The people from the guild told me that the two of<br/>you are experienced in more...off-record matters?')
('Van', 'Comparatively speaking.')
('Van', 'So, you want our help in finding a wallet that ended<br/>up on the black market?')
('Van', 'Can you tell us what happened?')
('Alicia', 'Of course. I was a victim of pickpocketing a few days<br/>ago, and my wallet was stolen.')
('Alicia', 'I told the guild about it right away, and they managed<br/>to catch the culprit...')
('Alicia', 'But they unfortunately already used all the mira inside<br/>and sold the wallet itself.')
('Agnès', 'Oh, no...')
('Alicia', 'The bracers were able to recover some of the money<br/>for me, at least.')
('Alicia', "But it's the wallet itself I cared most about.")
('Alicia', "It was a present my parents gave me for my<br/>twentieth birthday! It's one of my most<br/>prized possessions.")
('Alicia', 'I really, really want to get it back, whatever it takes!')
('Agnès', 'I understand why.')
('Alicia', "Buying it back from the black market won't be<br/>an issue. I'm willing to put the mira forward for it.")
('Alicia', 'So, will you please help me?')
('Van', "With it bein' a direct request from the guild, I don't<br/>see any issue in takin' you up on it.")
('Van', '(Should we start right now?)')
('Alicia', "I'm willing to buy the wallet back if that's what<br/>it takes.")
('Alicia', 'So, will you please help me?')
('Van', 'Well...')
('Van', '(Should we start right now?)')
('Van', "Sorry, we're a bit busy at the moment. Do you mind if<br/>we think about it first?")
('Van', "We'll come back and talk to you again once things<br/>have settled down.")
('Alicia', "I see... All right. I'll be waiting here, then!")
('Van', "All right, we'll do it. Can you tell us a bit about the<br/>wallet itself?")
('Van', 'Gotta be pretty valuable if a pickpocket would just up<br/>and sell it like that.')
('Alicia', "It is. It's a Pintilie, from their memorial lineup.")
('Alicia', "It's high quality leather, made to last. My parents<br/>saved for a while so they could afford it for me.")
('Agnès', 'Pintilie is a luxury brand. Last I checked, their wallets<br/>go for at least a few thousand mira apiece.')
('Agnès', 'I condemn that they did it in the first place, but I<br/>understand why a thief would opt to sell it.')
('Van', 'Huh. Okay, one more question.')
('Van', 'Did the pickpocket tell the guild who they sold it to?')
('Alicia', 'Unfortunately, they refused to say that much.')
('Alicia', 'The guild still tried to find the wallet...')
('Alicia', "...but they've had no luck in finding it, no matter how<br/>hard they've searched.")
('Van', 'They tried at least, though.')
('Van', "Still, it helps narrow down my search. Just gotta<br/>look where the guild didn't.")
('Van', 'Betting it ended up in the hands of a competent<br/>black market seller.')
('Van', "Now that I think about it, it might've been that<br/>old guy...")
('Agnès', 'Wait, you have an idea where it might be?')
('Van', 'An idea, yeah.')
('Van', "Not sure, but it's worth checkin'.")
('Van', "He's probably down there right now... No,<br/>scratch that. He's probably in the department store<br/>boutique right now, actually.")
('Agnès', "Let's see if we can find something there, then.")
('Van', "We'll let you know how things go later.")
('Alicia', "Thank you! I'll be waiting!")
('System', 'Quest The Brave Little Wallet started!')
('Neumann', 'Welcome to our store! How may I help you today?')
('Van', 'Mind if I ask you a question?')
('Van', "We're lookin' for one of your regulars. An old man<br/>called Yimai.")
('Van', "We wanna talk business with him, y'see.")
('Van', 'Has he been here today?')
('Neumann', 'He came here not long ago, actually!')
('Neumann', 'He often buys our lower quality and outdated goods<br/>at surprisingly fair prices.')
('Neumann', 'Was in a very good mood today, too. He mentioned<br/>picking up a good haul today.')
('Neumann', 'I think he said his next stop would be a repair shop?<br/>He wanted to stop by and see if they had anything<br/>worth buying.')
('Agnès', 'Maybe he was referring to the one in Old Town?')
('Van', "That's what my mira's on. Let's go check it out.")
('Agnès', 'Oh, come to think of it...')
('Agnès', 'This store looks like it sells wallets, too.')
('Agnès', "Have you ever sold any wallets from Pintilie's<br/>memorial series here?")
('Neumann', "We still do, actually. We've stocked them ever since<br/>they were first put onto the market last year.")
('Neumann', "They're a really popular item of ours since you can<br/>engrave them. Our customer base loves them.")
('Van', "How much do they cost? I've heard it's at least a few<br/>thousand mira.")
('Neumann', "It'd be about ten thousand mira, sales tax included.")
('Van', 'Got it. We learned a lot from you, so thanks for<br/>the info.')
('Neumann', "Not at all. I'm happy to have been of service.")
('Agnès', 'Next, we should head off to the repair shop in Old<br/>Town, then!')
('System', 'They contacted Alicia, and agreed to meet her in the<br/>orbal café.')
('Agnès', 'Buying it back cost us 5,000 mira, but we believe this<br/>is the wallet you were looking for.')
('Agnès', 'Could you take a look at it yourself to confirm?')
('Alicia', 'Of course!')
('System', 'Agnès handed the wallet to Alicia.')
('Alicia', "'Happy twentieth birthday. May your life be filled<br/>with endless joy.'")
('Alicia', "*sniffle* I can't believe it... It's a little embarrassing<br/>that you had to see me like this, but this is definitely<br/>my wallet!")
('Alicia', "I honestly never thought I'd see it again.")
('Alicia', "And much less so quickly! I can't believe you got it<br/>back to me.")
('Agnès', "Heehee. I'm glad to hear we bought the right one.")
('Alicia', "I'll have to go and thank the guild for referring you to<br/>me, too!")
('Alicia', 'You have no idea how much this means to me.<br/>Thank you so much!')
('Van', "No problem. Just make sure you don't go fallin' for<br/>another pickpocket.")
('System', 'Quest The Brave Little Wallet completed!')
('System', 'Earned')
('System', 'Received')
('Ilhan', "Lucky you. Sounds like she's in the area.")
('Ilhan', "How about you take a seat and wait for her<br/>over there? I'll bring out some drinks.")
('Van', 'Thanks.')
('Agnès', 'Much appreciated.')
('Feri', 'Umm...')
('Feri', "Didn't Jonas say we shouldn't talk to her?")
('Feri', 'Is it really all right for us to meet her without<br/>reporting back to him?')
('Van', "Plans don't always pan out in this line of work.")
('Van', "And I ain't following his plan if this job turns out to<br/>go against my principles.")
('Feri', '(Is this really what spriggans are like?)')
('System', 'Wait for Jessica to arrive here?')
('System', 'The three of them sat down to wait. A woman arrived<br/>before long.')
('Jessica', "It's nice to meet you. My name is Jessica.")
('Jessica', "I take it you're from Arkride Solutions? I heard about<br/>it from Ilhan.")
('Van', "That's right. Thanks for comin'.")
('Van', 'Our client gave us a photo of you, and we used that to<br/>find you.')
('Van', "I wanna go over a few things with you, but let's start<br/>with your family.")
('Van', "We've met with a man who claims to be your brother.<br/>He's told us quite a fair bit about you. Does any of it<br/>ring a bell?")
('System', 'Van told Jessica everything that Jonas had told them.')
('Jessica', "I-I've never heard anything like that at all...")
('Jessica', "I guess my parents could've hidden it from me this<br/>whole time...")
('Agnès', 'Should it be true, I would understand it if they did,<br/>considering how delicate a matter it is.')
('Van', 'Okay, next question.')
('Van', "You ever got a problem with someone takin' photos<br/>of you without your consent?")
('Jessica', 'H-How did you know?!')
('Jessica', "Ahem... Yes, I have. They've even sent the<br/>photographs they've taken of me directly to my house.")
('Agnès', 'Is that why you chose to move away without telling<br/>anyone about where?')
('Jessica', 'Pretty much... I actually started feeling like I was<br/>being followed about a month ago.')
('Jessica', 'The feeling just kept getting worse and worse<br/>over time. I was proven right once I started receiving<br/>photos and letters to my home address.')
('Jessica', 'That was why I asked my boss to help make<br/>my move discreet.')
('Jessica', "I didn't feel safe going to the police or guild either for<br/>fear that it'd just anger him and make it all worse...")
('Feri', 'W-Wait a second!')
('Feri', 'Then the man who claimed to be your brother and<br/>gave us this job to begin with...')
('Van', "...Is probably the stalker she's been tryin' to shake this<br/>whole time.")
('Van', "Dude was probably just bullshittin' us right from the<br/>start so we'd do his stalkin' job for him.")
('Jessica', 'What?!')
('Jessica', "You mentioned you have a photograph of me with<br/>you, didn't you?")
('Jessica', 'Could I see it?')
('Van', "Yeah. 'S not a problem.")
('Jessica', 'N-Noooooo!')
('Jessica', "H-How?! He's STILL trying to find me?!")
('Jessica', "I thought it'd be over after I moved...")
('Agnès', "It's all right, Jessica. Please try and stay calm.")
('Van', "Sorry for upsettin' you like that. Still, I guess this<br/>confirms our suspicions.")
('Van', "Our client here ain't Jessica's brother. He's the stalker<br/>who's been makin' her life miserable lately.")
('Feri', "I can't believe it! I didn't even realize he was lying!")
('Agnès', "We're on your side here, Jessica. Please don't worry<br/>about that.")
('Van', "I got an idea here. Why don't you hire me so we can<br/>turn the tables on this asshole?")
('Jessica', 'Wh-What do you mean?')
('Sylvie', "Welcome! ...Oh, if it ain't Van. What can I do you<br/>for today?")
('Van', "I'm here on a job. Wanted to ask you a question.")
('Van', "You ever heard of a delinquent group goin' by the<br/>name Desire?")
('Sylvie', "Oh, yeah. Nasty bunch, the lot of them, and ain't got<br/>a lick of scruples. They'll even take jobs from A.")
('Sylvie', "Violence, blackmail, you name it. Their leader's<br/>supposed to be pretty smart, too.")
('Van', 'Got it. Sounds like a load of trouble to be honest.')
('Sylvie', 'That leader and one of his goons came here about a<br/>month ago.')
('Sylvie', "Bought two large caliber orbal guns and left.<br/>I'd rather not sell our goods to folks like those, but<br/>business is business.")
('Agnès', 'A month ago?')
('Agnès', "You don't happen to know the name of the person<br/>accompanying that leader, do you?")
('Feri', 'Did you say a month ago?')
('Feri', 'Do you remember what the other guy with him<br/>was called?')
('Aaron', 'Oh, yeah? A month ago?')
('Aaron', 'Do you remember the name of this other goon?')
('Sylvie', 'I think I do?')
('Sylvie', 'Mark, if memory serves me well.')
('Van', 'Jackpot. We finally found him.')
('Van', 'Anything else you can recall?')
('Sylvie', 'Hmm...')
('Sylvie', "Remember 'em talking about Mark takin' on this big<br/>job so he could split from the team.")
('Sylvie', "Guns they got were the real deal. Heavy stuff.<br/>Bigger 'n' meaner than anything a common gangster<br/>should be hauling around.")
('Sylvie', "Mark was a ball of nerves when I handed 'em to him.")
('Van', "So we're dealing with a gangster takin' on a big<br/>enough job that he needs to bust out the big guns<br/>for it. All so he could leave 'em.")
('Agnès', 'Just hearing that is very...ominous...')
('Feri', 'I have a bad feeling about this...')
('Aaron', 'None of this sounds good, I can tell you that much.')
('Sylvie', "That's all I remember.")
('Sylvie', "If you need any more info on Mark, maybe get it<br/>straight from the horse's mouth and just ask someone<br/>from Desire directly.")
('Van', "Yeah, it's probably a good idea.")
('Van', 'Can you point me at someone in particular?')
('Sylvie', "Sure can. You know Eddy, the son of the Newberry<br/>General Store's owner? He's part of their gang.")
('Van', 'Oh, right. Heard he was going through a bit of a<br/>rebellious phase lately.')
('Van', "But I didn't think he'd ended up joinin' Desire.")
('Van', "I dunno where he is right now, though.<br/>Well, Newberry's as good a place to start as any.")
('Van', 'Oh, right. Heard he was going through a bit of a<br/>rebellious phase lately.')
('Van', "We just saw him arguin' with his mom back at<br/>their shop.")
('Van', "I never thought he'd ended up in Desire, though.<br/>Weird.")
('Van', "Hopefully he's still there. Let's go see.")
('Agnès', "We're off to Old Town, then.")
('Feri', "Let's get going! To Old Town!")
('Aaron', 'All right. To Old Town we go.')
('Van', 'Thanks for the help.')
('Sylvie', "Don't mention it.")
('Sylvie', "Actually, I have somethin' else for you.")
('Sylvie', 'Heard this story through the orbal net recently.<br/>Took a while to reach my ears.')
('Sylvie', "Somethin' about these jaeger corps that got wiped out<br/>right in the outskirts of Baume. You hear about it?")
('Van', "That's not a name you hear often. Baume's up in the<br/>north-east, right?")
('Van', "First I've heard of it. How come you're tellin' us this?")
('Sylvie', 'Rumor has it that those jaeger corps were hired by<br/>someone outside the country.')
('Sylvie', "Most people speculate the carnage might've been<br/>A's doin'.")
('Sylvie', "It's got potential to mess with my weapon supply<br/>routes, so I was hopin' you'd heard somethin'.")
('Van', "Afraid not, sorry. But I'll keep you in the know if I do<br/>hear anything.")
('Van', '(Hmm... Might be something to keep in mind...)')
('Van', "(This place's name is Iota. Ilhan's the owner's name.)")
('Van', "(We're in the endgame now. Literally...)")
('Van', "You must be Ilhan, correct? Count Iota's butler.")
('Ilhan', 'You know my name? Then you must have come to<br/>save the princess!')
('Van', 'Sure have. And we got all three keys, too.')
('System', 'Van handed the three keys they gathered to Ilhan.')
('Ilhan', "You actually brought them! These are indeed the keys<br/>we need to unlock the princess' cell!")
('Ilhan', 'She may finally walk free once more!')
('Agnès', "It's such a relief to hear that.")
('Agnès', "But will you be okay? Won't you face consequences<br/>for your betrayal of the count?")
('Agnès', "(...Maybe I'm taking this game too seriously.)")
('Feri', "Whew. That's mission accomplished, then!")
('Feri', "But what's gonna happen to you? Will you get<br/>punished for betraying the count?")
('Aaron', "But you can't just go and backstab the count without<br/>paying the price, yeah?")
('Aaron', "What's the script say about that?")
('Ilhan', "You're absolutely right. I'm sure to pay a price for<br/>this—perhaps the steepest price of all.")
('Ilhan', "But I am only standing before you today because of<br/>the royal family. I could not live with myself if I<br/>didn't help them in their hour of need.")
('Ilhan', 'I will go and set the princess free now. Can I ask you<br/>to wait here while I do so?')
('Van', 'Sure.')
('Van', "Wonder who's playin' the princess.")
('Agnès', "I'm so excited for the finale. They put so much effort<br/>into the whole production.")
('Feri', "I wonder if she'll be in a fancy dress?")
('Aaron', 'She better be hot as hell considering everything we<br/>did to finish this whole thing.')
('Ilhan', "Thank you for your patience. I've brought the<br/>princess here with me.")
('Van', 'Nice. We finally get to—')
('Percy', 'Heehee! So you are the kind strangers who rescued<br/>me, are you?')
('Percy', 'Umm... Thank you so much! The Kingdom of Edith<br/>will never forget this kindness!')
('Van', "Oh, c'mon! At least put some oomph into it!<br/>Don't drop the ball at the end!")
('Agnès', "Heehee. Well, I didn't see this coming.")
('Feri', 'The ending kinda ruined the whole thing for me...')
('Aaron', 'Hell no! Can we get a recast on this princess?!')
('Percy', "I'm sorry. We couldn't find anyone to play the role of<br/>the princess in time.")
('Percy', 'Thanks for helping out, Ilhan.')
('Ilhan', "Hah, don't mention it. I had a lot of fun.")
('Ilhan', "I'd be happy to help out again if you have any<br/>other roles for me.")
('Ilhan', "I'll leave it to you, then. See you around!")
('Percy', 'Well! Can you tell me what you thought of the<br/>game, then?')
('Van', 'Honestly, it was more fun than I expected it to be.')
('Van', 'You clearly put a lot of effort into both the puzzles<br/>AND the setting.')
('Agnès', 'The story being so dramatic helped to draw us into<br/>it, too.')
('Feri', 'I really liked seeing who you picked for each role!')
('Aaron', "Your casting choices weren't half bad,<br/>princess notwithstanding.")
('Percy', 'Haha... I really am sorry about that.')
('Percy', "I wasn't sure if there was really a mystery game<br/>like this...")
('Percy', '...but judging by your reactions, it looks like I was<br/>worrying for nothing.')
('Van', 'Yeah. Could always try a different setting if you<br/>wanna shake things up a little.')
('Van', "Don't gotta stick to the kingdom and princess setting.")
('Percy', "Yep, that's the plan!")
('Percy', "I've always had trouble getting people to take an<br/>interest in my ideas. Many feel like puzzle games are<br/>just inaccessible.")
('Percy', "But if I can nail the setting, then maybe that'll draw<br/>people in! And then they'll realize how much fun they<br/>can be!")
('Van', 'Always good to see someone enjoying their hobbies.')
('Percy', "Yeah. But I don't plan on keeping it a hobby! I want<br/>to set up an event-planning company and take it to<br/>the next level.")
('Percy', 'Anyhow, my confidence is soaring sky high now with<br/>a glowing review coming from our famous spriggan!')
('Percy', "I'm heading home to start working on the next game!")
('System', 'Quest QA Testing completed!')
('System', 'Received')
('Neumann', 'Welcome to Jardin, sir. How may I help you?')
('Van', "Wanted to ask you somethin', actually.")
('System', 'Van introduced himself and asked the man if he had<br/>seen Lulua and a well-dressed woman in the<br/>shop recently.')
('Neumann', "I suspect you're referring to Madam Daphne. She is<br/>one of our regulars.")
('Neumann', 'She actually happened to stop by a few days ago,<br/>accompanied by a young woman.')
('Neumann', "I had thought she was Madam Daphne's<br/>granddaughter, but I see I was mistaken.")
('Van', 'Hmm...')
('Van', "The two must've seemed fairly close for you to get<br/>that impression.")
('Neumann', 'Oh, they most certainly did.')
('Van', "Guess you haven't seen them today?")
('Neumann', 'A correct assumption.')
('Neumann', 'I hear that Madam Daphne frequents the Erland<br/>store in the Seiden District as well as our own.')
('Neumann', 'Perhaps she may have visited there today instead?<br/>I hear she is on good terms with its manager, too.')
('Van', 'Erland over in the Seiden District? Got it.')
('Van', 'Thanks for the info.')
('Neumann', "You're quite welcome, sir.")
('Van', '(Over to Seiden I go, then.)')
('Van', "You're Isla, right? You wanted to hire us?")
('System', 'Van handed her his business card.')
('Isla', "Arkride Solutions... So you're the spriggan!")
('Isla', "I-I can't believe I'm actually meeting you...")
('Judith', "You'd think you were meeting a celebrity<br/>or something.")
('Isla', "Oh! I'm sorry if I offended you. It's just that I've only<br/>ever heard rumors about you. I wasn't even sure you<br/>were real.")
('Isla', "I'm so glad you came. I didn't have anyone else to<br/>turn to.")
('Agnès', 'Would you tell us what the job is about?')
('Isla', 'Oh, of course.')
('Isla', 'But could we discuss this someplace else? Just let me<br/>ask my boss for permission to step out for a moment.')
('Van', 'So, the job description mentioned you wanting to<br/>go home?')
('Isla', "Yes, that's right.")
('Isla', "My parents called this morning to inform me my<br/>grandmother, who's been hospitalized, is in<br/>critical condition.")
('Isla', "She's been in the hospital for quite a while now, so<br/>I'm worried it might finally be her time...")
('Judith', 'I can understand why you want to see her so<br/>badly, then.')
('Isla', 'The issue is that my home and the hospital are both<br/>in Anchorville City.')
('Isla', "I know what I'm asking is unreasonable, since we're<br/>not allowed to leave the capital right now.")
('Isla', "And it's why I couldn't go to the guild or anyone else<br/>about this.")
('Quatre', 'I understand your reasoning in coming to us.')
('Risette', 'That certainly explains why you called on us.')
('Aaron', "Yeah, I get why you'd ask us for help.")
('Feri', "It makes sense why you'd ask us.")
('Feri', "But aren't there checkpoints all around the city?<br/>Can we even get through those?")
('Aaron', "There are checkpoints set up around the city though,<br/>aren't there? Can we even get through those?")
('Risette', "Regardless, there are still checkpoints all around<br/>the city. Passing through those won't be an easy task.")
('Quatre', "But there's checkpoints all around the city.<br/>How could we get through them?")
('Van', "Hmm. Before we decide if we'll take the job or not, I<br/>wanna hear somethin' from you.")
('Van', 'The state of emergency was issued by the government<br/>and applies to everyone in Edith.')
('Van', "You'll be breakin' the law if you try to leave.")
('Van', "That's the kinda thing that goes on your record<br/>forever if you get caught.")
('Van', "Might even screw up your chances of workin' in<br/>the capital. That bein' said, are you sure you really<br/>wanna do this?")
('Isla', 'I understand that, and I understand the state our<br/>country is in right now.')
('Isla', 'But this might be the last time I ever see<br/>my grandma...')
('Isla', "I'd never forgive myself if I just sat here and waited<br/>for it to happen. I want to at least try to see her one<br/>last time.")
('Isla', "If the worst really happens, I'll have to live with the<br/>fact that I never even got to say goodbye to her.")
('Judith', 'Isla...')
('Isla', "My parents said they'll come and pick me up outside<br/>the city if I can make it that far.")
('Isla', "All I need to do is make it out of Edith. Well, I say<br/>'all' like that's not the hardest part...")
('Van', 'Got it. I can tell your resolve is strong.')
('Van', 'As for us...')
('Isla', "My grandmother's taken a turn for the worse in the<br/>hospital, so I really want to go home and see her.")
('Isla', "Won't you please help me leave the capital?")
('Van', "I'd like to help, but with everything gone haywire,<br/>we're really busy right now.")
('Van', 'You mind if we get back to you later?')
('Isla', "I see... That's very unfortunate, but I understand<br/>where you're coming from.")
('Isla', 'Please let me know if you end up being able to<br/>help, though.')
('Van', "We're happy to help you see it through.")
('Van', "I'll drive you to Anchorville myself, whatever it takes.")
('Isla', 'Oh, thank you!')
('Van', 'Judith, Agnès, can you come with us?')
('Van', 'Probably gonna be a rough ride, so some emotional<br/>support will come in handy.')
('Agnès', 'Absolutely!')
('Judith', "I wasn't planning to leave you alone with her in the<br/>first place.")
('Van', 'Everyone else can stay here and keep an eye on<br/>things, gather info and stuff.')
('Van', "I'm countin' on you.")
('Feri', 'Got it!')
('Aaron', 'Heh. Works for me.')
('Risette', 'Please be careful.')
('Quatre', "I'll keep you updated on the traffic information while<br/>you're out.")
('Risette', "I'll keep you apprised of the latest traffic news while<br/>you're out in the field.")
('Van', 'Thanks.')
('Van', "Okay. We're heading out.")
('System', 'With the approval for her request secured, Isla<br/>quickly finished packing, and she joined Van, Agnès,<br/>and Judith in the car.')
('System', 'Once everyone was on board, they set off for<br/>the expressway.')
('System', 'Quest A Return Home started!')
('Van', '...')
('Agnès', 'Van...')
('Aaron', 'That reporter friend of yours used to work at<br/>Meld, right? The biggest gossip rag in Calvard.')
('Aaron', "I didn't know you were tight with the<br/>editor-in-chief.")
('Van', "I'm not. Dingo's mentioned him before, but I've<br/>never met the guy.")
('Van', "Supposed to be a bit of a headache to deal with, so<br/>I've tried to keep it that way, too.")
('Van', 'But it looks like my luck just ran out.')
('Feri', 'I really think we should meet him...')
('Quatre', "I wonder if he's there already? The orbal café's just<br/>over there.")
('Risette', "Perhaps he might be waiting for us already?<br/>Walking to the orbal café shouldn't take us so long.")
('Judith', "I wonder if he's there already? It's not that long a<br/>walk from here to the orbal café.")
('Bergard', 'We should go and visit him when we get a<br/>chance, then.')
('Judith', "Let's go meet with the guy once we have the chance.")
('Risette', 'We will have to go and pay him a visit as soon as we<br/>have an opportunity.')
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', "You really did come. Not that I didn't trust Dingo<br/>at all.")
('Van', "The name's Van Arkride. I take it you're<br/>Meld's editor-in-chief?")
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', "Yep, that's me. Me and Dingo go back about<br/>seven years.")
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', 'He told me a lot about you. Sounds like you were real<br/>busy over in Oración, too.')
('Van', "Heh. No clue what you're on about.")
('Feri', '(I thought there would be no reports about us being<br/>involved with it?)')
('Agnès', "(There won't. The authorities are keeping it a secret.)")
('Aaron', "(Dude's probably just saying that to get under<br/>our skin.)")
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', "Heh. Well, whatever. It's not getting an article,<br/>so I'm not interested.")
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', 'I called you here for one of those 4SPGs of yours.<br/>Nothing more, nothing less.')
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', "The gist of it is that I want you to help me look<br/>for Dingo's notebook.")
('Van', '...Oh?')
('Aaron', "What's this about?")
('Agnès', "You suspect he had a notebook containing<br/>information he'd gathered as a reporter—or more like<br/>as an information dealer?")
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', 'Both, actually.')
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', 'I first heard about it a few weeks ago, just before he<br/>headed off to Creil.')
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', 'I could tell he was chasing a dangerous scoop of<br/>some kind.')
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', 'So I jokingly asked if he had a will ready yet.')
('Feri', '...')
('Agnès', 'Oh...')
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', "And look at us now. It didn't really occur to me, not<br/>even for a second, that this would happen to him just<br/>four days later.")
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', 'He laughed at it at the time, and said one thing<br/>to me.')
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', "'The closest thing I have to a will is my notebook.'")
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', "'I've left it with a trusted source, so if anything<br/>happens to me, send out a 4SPG about it.'")
('Aaron', 'Wait a second...')
('Van', 'So this is a third memento of his, on top of the video<br/>and camera...')
('Van', "We don't have that notebook ourselves, though.")
('Van', "Sorry if that's what you were hopin' for.")
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', "Oh, I never thought you did. But I suspect you're the<br/>only one who can track it down.")
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', "Dingo seemed to trust you more than anyone, so I<br/>suspect that's the way he wanted it to play out, too.")
('Van', '...!')
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', 'The authorities have got everything that happened in<br/>Creil down on lock, and Almata are dead and gone.')
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', "So I can't imagine it'd have anything worth writing an<br/>article about in it to begin with, which means it's not<br/>worth my while hunting down.")
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', "But I can't just go and ignore his words about it.")
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', "So here we are. I'll put up the money for you to find<br/>this thing. My last gift to him.")
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', "So, what's it gonna be, spriggan?")
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', "You gonna go find Dingo's notebook, or not?")
('Van', '...')
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', "So, what's it gonna be, spriggan?")
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', "You gonna go find Dingo's notebook, or not?")
('Van', '...')
('Van', "Sorry, but we've got a lot on our plate right now.<br/>I can't give you an answer right away.")
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', 'Heh. Fair enough. Let me know if you do take the<br/>job on, though.')
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', "You don't have to if you don't want to, y'know.<br/>Hell, it'd be cheaper for me if you didn't.")
('Van', "We'll take the job. You got anything else you want<br/>to share?")
('Van', 'Maybe he said something more about this trusted<br/>source of his, for example?')
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', 'Heh. Yeah, I remember telling him that was nowhere<br/>near enough info to find the thing myself.')
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', "Only hint he gave me was that it's with 'people who<br/>know about as much about my past as you do.'")
('Van', 'Hmm...')
('Aaron', 'Heh. Way to pique my interest.')
('Agnès', "I wonder what Dingo's past was like...")
('Van', "I've only heard bits of it myself.")
('Van', 'How much do you know?')
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', 'Even less than you do, I suspect.')
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', "I know he used to live in Messeldam before ending<br/>up in the capital seven years ago. That's about it.")
('Feri', "(Wait, didn't Dantès act like he knew him?)")
('Dantès', "It's been some time since we last met, Dingo Brad.<br/>Though we did cross paths in Tharbad—<br/>albeit briefly.")
('Dantès', "If we exclude that little encounter, I haven't seen you<br/>since your days as a mere informant in Messeldam.")
('Dingo', "Yeah, and you were still Enrique's<br/>second-in-command back then.")
('Risette', '(Saying the two of them knew each other at length<br/>beforehand would be a fair assumption.)')
('Quatre', '(He said something along those lines when they were<br/>talking in that video, too.)')
('Judith', '(They did touch on it during the Creil video.)')
('Van', "All right. We'll see what we can dig up with that<br/>info, then.")
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', 'Good luck.')
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', "Anyway, my break's over. I've gotta get back to work<br/>on finding scoops for the festival.")
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', "I'll give you my number. Just give me a call if you do<br/>find it.")
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', "I'll wire you the money if you do. It can be my way of<br/>honoring Dingo's death.")
('Van', "Got it. We'll take it from here.")
('Aaron', "So, what's the plan here? We don't exactly have a load<br/>of info to go off of.")
('Feri', "Only clue we have is that it's someone that knows as<br/>much about Dingo as that guy does...")
('Agnès', 'That rules out Jack and Bermotti—and<br/>Van, obviously.')
('Agnès', 'Oh, and Renne, too.')
('Van', "Yeah. Any information dealer's probably out of<br/>question here, and so is anyone with as many<br/>connections as Renne has.")
('Judith', 'And people like Nina and I know even less than that<br/>editor-in-chief does.')
('Judith', 'Dingo was a very private person, and it went<br/>both ways. It honestly surprised me to see a gossip<br/>magazine reporter being so considerate.')
('Van', "That's just how Dingo was.")
('Van', 'Jack, Bermotti, and I tried not to pry into his past<br/>either, mind you.')
('Van', "But somethin' must've happened between Dingo and<br/>Dantès while he was still in Messeldam.")
('Van', "He left the city after whatever that was, ending up in<br/>the capital and becomin' a reporter right after.")
('Van', "Dunno any details, but I imagine we'll get out of this<br/>knowin' a whole lot more than we came in with.")
('Van', "We're gonna be unearthing what he tried to bury this<br/>whole time. All the burdens he carried by himself.")
('Agnès', 'Van...')
('Aaron', "You don't look like you're about to back<br/>down, though.")
('Van', "Hah, no way. A job's a job, and I'm nothin' if I can't<br/>see this kinda shit through.")
('Van', "But anyway. I can think of at least one person who'd<br/>fit the bill for this job that won't be a pain in the ass<br/>to meet up with.")
('Feri', 'Oh?')
('Van', "It's not an information dealer, mind you, but she was<br/>close to Dingo.")
('Van', "I can't be the only one who immediately thought<br/>of her.")
('Feri', 'Oh!')
('Bergard', 'I suspect I see who you mean now.')
('Quatre', "A rookie reporter who's still unwise to the ways of<br/>the underworld.")
('Risette', 'It does seem plausible that she might<br/>know something.')
('Agnès', 'Are we going to meet her, then?')
('Van', "Yeah, let's head on over to the Tyrell Times.")
('Van', "Don't think a meetin' with her will be all that hard to<br/>get as long as she's not out of the office.")
('Feri', 'Right!')
('Van', 'Oh, damn it! That bastard up and left us with the bill.')
('Aaron', "Gotta be pretty sly if you're gonna be running the<br/>biggest gossip rag in the country.")
('Agnès', "W-Well, it's the least we could do for him since he<br/>brought this to our attention.")
('Van', "(Whoops. Can't forget to bring Agnès before I hit<br/>this place up.)")
('Manager Deborah', "Oh! You couldn't have come at a better time!")
('Manager Deborah', 'I have a particular snack I stocked a surplus of in<br/>preparation for the festival.')
('Manager Deborah', "They're called honey glazed pretzels, and they're very<br/>popular over in Crossbell. Have you heard of them?")
('Agnès', "I have! They're a kind of bread shaped like a<br/>knot, right?")
('Agnès', "But I've never had the chance to try one.")
('Van', "I believe they're originally Erebonian, actually.")
('Van', "They wound up in Crossbell, where honey and<br/>Eastern spices were added to the mix and bam.<br/>Somethin' totally unique.")
('Agnès', 'Could we take a few of them off your hands to go as<br/>a sampler?')
('Van', "Okay, we've visited all the stores we planned on.")
('Agnès', "We've also got plenty of things to try! Shall we head<br/>back to Odette?")
('Van', "This is the area in front of the station, the<br/>Seventh District. Of course, I'm sure this ain't your<br/>first time coming here.")
('Agnès', "It isn't. It'd be hard to live in Edith and not come<br/>here from time to time.")
('Van', "My work brings me here plenty, too, so that's not<br/>gonna be changin'.")
('Van', "Aside from the station itself, there's also the<br/>department store where you can stock up on items<br/>and equipment.")
('Van', "Then there's the orbal café over there. If you need<br/>anything Xipha-related, that's where you'll wanna go.")
('Van', "As long as you know where those two places are,<br/>you're golden. You can get most stuff you need<br/>between 'em.")
('Agnès', "The head branch of the Bracer Guild in Calvard is<br/>also here, isn't it?")
('Van', "Urk... Yeah, but I'd rather not go anywhere near there<br/>unless we got a good reason to.")
('Agnès', 'Oh? How come?')
('Van', "Call it a business rivalry. Not to mention we can<br/>brush up against the line of what's considered strictly<br/>legal here and there.")
('Van', "The less they notice us, the better. You can go and<br/>visit them if you want, but I'd rather not go with you.")
('Agnès', 'I-I see...')
('Agnès', '(For someone who wants nothing to do with the<br/>guild, he seemed to know that bracer we encountered<br/>in the Riverside District very well.)')
('Van', "Anyway, now that we're here, let's just look around<br/>for a bit until our client calls.")
('Agnès', 'Right!')
('Van', 'Two of your limited edition lattes, to go.')
('Ilhan', "Coming right up! I thought you'd be pleased to see<br/>them in the menu again.")
('Van', "Ah, shit. You mind havin' the same as me? Sorry, I<br/>probably should've asked.")
('Agnès', "Oh, it's fine.")
('Agnès', 'I feel like I can trust your taste when it comes to<br/>sweet things.')
('Van', 'Heh. Damn right you can.')
('Van', "(They're not gonna follow us up to the second<br/>floor, huh?)")
('Agnès', '(...?)')
('Ilhan', "Sorry for the wait. Here's your lattes. Be careful,<br/>'cause they're hot!")
('System', 'Van received his order.')
('Van', "All right. Last stop's the flower seller in Old Town.")
('Agnès', 'To collect the muffins you asked for earlier?')
('Van', "Yup. Dying to give 'em a try. Let's get goin'.")
('Agnès', 'I thought we were purchasing sweets? What does a<br/>flower seller have to do with that?')
('Van', 'The guy uses flower nectar to make baked goods on<br/>the side.')
('Van', "Didn't get a chance to see him earlier on today, but I<br/>heard through the grapevine he's been workin' on<br/>somethin' new. Let's give it a look.")
('Van', 'Tch.')
('Elaine', 'You stay right there.')
('Elaine', "It's very rude to try and slink off the second you see<br/>someone, you know.")
('Van', "Was just bein' mindful. Didn't wanna bother<br/>you two.")
('Fie', "Your timing's actually perfect.")
('Fie', 'I was just telling her about how I ran into you guys<br/>earlier today.')
('Fie', 'We can get through the story faster with you here.')
('Van', "That's not...")
('Van', 'Fine. I guess I can chat you guys up for a sec.')
('Elaine', 'Trust you to sit next to Fie instead of me. Is she more<br/>your type?')
('Van', "It's 'cause she's the one who invited me over.<br/>Don't look too hard into things.")
('Elaine', "I'm just kidding. ...Though you'll forgive me for being<br/>suspicious when you seemingly only employ young<br/>women now.")
('Van', "I didn't hire any of 'em willingly! I told you<br/>that already. You know I'd much rather work alone if<br/>I can help it.")
('Elaine', "I know. Easier for your shady work to happen when<br/>there's no witnesses at all, right?")
('Van', "There's nothing shady about my work! I got standards<br/>and I ain't about to forgo 'em.")
('Elaine', 'Then why are you always trying to avoid me?')
('Van', "Now, that's a whole different issue.")
('Fie', "Third-wheeling's no fun.")
('Elaine', "That wasn't... *sigh* Sorry, I didn't want you to see<br/>me like that.")
('Fie', "Oh, I could listen to this all night. Not everyone gets<br/>to see the Beauty's Blade like this.")
('Van', "We're done now!")
('Fie', "Heehee. Zin wasn't kidding about the two of you<br/>getting along.")
('Elaine', "I'm not sure that's how I'd put it...")
('Van', "We've just known each other for a long time.<br/>That's all there is to it.")
('Elaine', "...Yes, that's right.")
('Fie', "I won't pry, but you two avoiding it so much only<br/>makes me more curious. Guess I'll figure out the rest<br/>on my own.")
('Fie', "Thanks for giving me something else to enjoy while<br/>I'm in Calvard.")
('Van', "The guild needs to stop lookin' toward smartasses for<br/>help, I swear.")
('Van', "First it's Kitty and now you.")
('Fie', 'You know her, too?')
('Van', "I take it the guild's had an eye on her for a while now?")
('Elaine', 'Of course. Especially considering who her<br/>current family is.')
('Elaine', "But she's only here in Calvard as a student right now.<br/>We have no intention of interfering in her affairs.")
('Van', "Yeaaah... I'm takin' that one with a big grain of salt.<br/>Especially when Zin's involved.")
('Van', "Still dunno why you're pawnin' jobs off on me when<br/>y'all have so many resources on hand already.")
('Fie', "You can never have too many. We'll still be short in<br/>the long term.")
('Elaine', "I hate to agree, but she's right.")
('Van', 'Man...')
('Van', "Well, thanks for the invite. I'll get out of your<br/>hair now.")
('Fie', "Sure thing. I learned a lot from talking with you.<br/>We'll have to sit down again together sometime.")
('Van', 'No promises.')
('Fie', 'Would you rather I not third wheel next time and<br/>leave you two alone?')
('Van', 'Not what I meant!')
('Elaine', 'Fie...')
('Fie', "I'll stop teasing her now before she gets angrier.")
('Fie', "Bye, Van. I'm sure we'll see each other again soon.")
('Van', "Wouldn't surprise me if we did.")
('Hazel', 'You came just at the right time!')
('Van', "Oh, no. Lookin' to shove more work onto us?")
('Elaine', 'No, we just wanted to ask you about something.')
('Elaine', 'Your ranks continue to swell, I see...')
('Risette', "My name is Risette Twinings, and I'm a concierge for<br/>the Marduk Company.")
('Risette', "I'm currently on long-term loan to Arkride Solutions,<br/>and hope to support Mr. Arkride to the best of my<br/>abilities for the remainder of my contract.")
('Risette', "It's a pleasure to meet you.")
('Elaine', 'Long-term loan?! And from THE Marduk?!')
('Elaine', '...')
('Elaine', "Well, aren't you fortunate to have such a capable and<br/>beautiful maid working for you?")
('Van', "That's not why she's here! She's backin' me up 'cause<br/>I'm a Marduk tester, and that's all!")
('Risette', 'As a valued client, I aim to support and assist you in<br/>any way I am able.')
('Risette', 'That includes your daily life, so please feel free to<br/>assign me any task you see fit.')
('Van', 'Can you not?!')
('Agnès', "(Risette looks the part, but I'm sure she'd be a<br/>splendid maid, too.)")
('Elaine', '...')
('Elaine', "Anyway, let's get back on topic. We wanted to ask<br/>you about what happened in Tharbad.")
('Van', "I figured Sylphid would've told you all the<br/>details already.")
('Hazel', "She's given us her report, yes. But it left a lot of<br/>unanswered questions.")
('Hazel', 'We were hoping you could help to fill in the gaps.')
('Elaine', "Exactly—like what happened when you fought<br/>Almata's leader and how you managed to get him<br/>to retreat.")
('Van', "*sigh* All right, shoot. I'll answer what I can.")
('Elaine', 'First question, then. Are you certain that puppeteer is<br/>connected to Almata?')
('Feri', "...Yeah. She was one of the people who attacked<br/>Aida's corps.")
('Aaron', "She was one of the people who took out that<br/>Eisenschild company, wasn't she?")
('Van', "Yeah, but she did say she was only contracted by 'em<br/>and isn't really a part of Almata.")
('Agnès', "She's supposedly part of the organization that<br/>Melchior was originally affiliated with.")
('Agnès', 'The two of them were just...terrifying.<br/>Much different from the mafia.')
('Van', "They got the eyes of a stone-cold killer, the both<br/>of 'em. Real pros, I'd bet.")
('Van', "Not that the mafia doesn't stoop that low, but it ain't<br/>really their style. They're more the kind to beat the<br/>shit outta you and then blackmail you.")
('Van', "Those two? Nah, they wouldn't do that.")
('Van', "If the victim's not dead, then it ain't good enough.<br/>Death is their endgame.")
('Van', "The girl's bad, but Melchior's in a class of his own.<br/>He enjoys the kill about as much as toyin' with his<br/>prey beforehand.")
('Elaine', 'Perhaps the organization she and Melchior originate<br/>from is focused on assassination.')
('Elaine', 'I suspect I know which one, too.')
('Van', "...And I suspect you're right about it.")
('Agnès', '(...?)')
('Risette', "It clearly is an organization separate from Almata<br/>altogether, even if it's evident that the connections<br/>between the two run deep.")
('Hazel', "That's ominous.")
('Hazel', "We'd have options available if it was just your<br/>run-of-the-mill mafia.")
('Elaine', "We'll have our work cut out for us, that's for sure.")
('Elaine', "Though there's something else that bothers me<br/>regarding Almata...")
('Van', "Where they're gettin' their mira from, I take it?")
('Elaine', '...Exactly.')
('Elaine', 'We already established that Almata used Vegas Films<br/>to spread those illegal drugs among the people<br/>in Tharbad.')
('Elaine', 'But acquiring so many and sneaking them into the<br/>orbal hookahs must have cost an eye-watering<br/>amount of money—and for no profit, either.')
('Feri', "That's true... It's not something you can do without<br/>having a lot of mira to spare.")
('Aaron', "You're not doing that at all unless you got the mira<br/>to burn.")
('Van', "Could've always raised it over time via illegal means,<br/>but I don't think that's it.")
('Van', "I ain't got a clue what the source really is, though.")
('Elaine', '...I see.')
('Hazel', 'Either way, talking with you was definitely<br/>illuminating. Thank you for your time.')
('Hazel', 'If you learn anything else, please let the guild know.')
('Risette', "We will. The guild's cooperation is going to be vital<br/>in taking down Almata.")
('Van', "Not that it makes sense for a little solutions agency<br/>like us to be handlin' somethin' this big to begin with.")
('Van', "So if you guys learn anything, don't be stingy and let<br/>us know, too.")
('Elaine', '...As long as our interests align, we will.')
('Elaine', "Much as I'd rather you not be involved with them in<br/>the first place.")
('Van', "I don't wanna be involved with 'em, either!")
('Van', "But it ain't that easy when they already got their eye<br/>on you and won't take no for an answer.")
('Feri', "I feel like there's more to it than that...")
('Aaron', 'You gotta be kidding me.')
('Risette', "I suspect your nature wouldn't let you avert your eyes<br/>from them, even if you could.")
('Elaine', 'The more things change, the more they stay<br/>the same...')
('Van', 'I swear...')
('Agnès', 'Ahaha...')
('Director Gotti', "Well, look who it is! I haven't seen you all since you<br/>were in Tharbad!")
('Van', "We weren't expecting to run into you here<br/>either, Director.")
('Director Gotti', 'I see Judith is with you, too!')
('Judith', 'Things just kinda worked out like that.')
('Van', "How come you're with Lieutenant Kaela?")
('Director Gotti', "Government asked yours truly to help with the<br/>ceremony's production!")
('Van', 'Makes sense. You did do a good job with the film<br/>festival planning, catastrophes notwithstanding.')
('Director Gotti', "Haha! Don't act like you didn't help at all there!")
('Aaron', 'I could do without a do-over from the last festival.')
('Agnès', "Please don't jinx it...")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "I wouldn't worry so much. You're more than aware of<br/>the fact that we're finally rid of A. The odds of<br/>anything major happening are low at best.")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "It's not improbable that there are remnants still out<br/>there, so security is still just as tight. As a precaution.")
('Van', 'You here to discuss unit placement, then?')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "That's right.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "The meeting's with us more than anything.")
('Quatre', "Supervisor Giscard! And Essy, too! I heard you'd<br/>help with the festival, but I didn't realize you'd be<br/>coming all the way here.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "Heehee. It's been a while.")
('Feri', 'We met you guys at Basel!')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "It's good to see you again, too.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "We're helping set up all the equipment for<br/>the ceremony.")
('Van', "Oh, yeah. Y'all are showin' off some new stuff, right.<br/>Must be pretty busy, then.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "Drowning in work, more like! This isn't even my<br/>specialty, but here I am, slaving away. Though your<br/>sympathy does soothe the pain, Van.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "...You don't mind if I call you Van, right?")
('Van', 'Course not.')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'Heehee. Good!')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'You can call me Essy just like Quatre does, if<br/>you want!')
('Van', "That, I'm gonna pass on.")
('Van', '(She gets real casual real quick.)')
('Quatre', "(That's just how Essy is. She's really friendly<br/>to everyone.)")
('Risette', 'Will Professor Cronkite be in attendance at<br/>the unveiling?')
('Aaron', 'Is that smartass professor gonna be at the unveiling?')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "He'll be at the ceremony, but not much else. He's got<br/>his hands more than full with another project<br/>right now.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'Professor Hamilton will be here, too.')
('Quatre', 'Really?!')
('Quatre', "The four of us might finally be able to get together.<br/>It's been such a long time...")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'Heehee. I certainly hope so.')
('Director Gotti', 'Esmeray, Kaela! Mind hearing me out here?')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'Oh?')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', 'What about?')
('Director Gotti', "You two are bursting at the seams with sex appeal!<br/>There's this pizzazz to ya! It's everything I could've<br/>hoped for, and more!")
('Director Gotti', 'What do you say we chase new heights<br/>of sexiness toge—')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', 'I am far too busy to even consider the proposition.')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "That's not a field I have much interest in, I'm afraid.")
('Director Gotti', 'What?!')
('Director Gotti', 'Is Judith all I have left?!')
('Judith', "Hey, hey. I don't remember agreeing to<br/>your nonsense.")
('Agnès', 'Ahaha... Same as always.')
('Van', "Now here's a group you don't see every day.")
('General Manager Thorndyke', "Well, if it isn't Arkride.")
('Risette', "I didn't expect to encounter you here, sir.")
('General Manager Thorndyke', "I found an opening in my schedule, so I'm here to<br/>take advantage of it.")
('Aaron', "Hey, Cao. Aren't you supposed to be<br/>babysitting Ashen?")
('Cao', "I believe she'd be rather cross with you if she heard<br/>you say that.")
('Quatre', "I didn't know you were here, Yang.")
('Professor Cronkite', 'That I am. I intend to meet with Professor<br/>Hamilton later.')
('General Manager Thorndyke', "While I have you here, I'd like to express just how<br/>impressed I was that you were able to defeat our unit<br/>in Oración.")
('Van', "Sorry 'bout that one. Didn't really have a choice at<br/>the time.")
('General Manager Thorndyke', "Oh, don't feel the need to apologize. If anything, you<br/>allowed us to obtain some very interesting data from<br/>the encounter.")
('General Manager Thorndyke', 'And I imagine that you made quite the contribution<br/>yourself, Risette.')
('Risette', 'I certainly hope I was able to make myself useful.')
('Van', "Take it you're in town because of the unveilin'<br/>ceremony, Professor?")
('Professor Cronkite', 'I was invited here and attended as the lead developer<br/>on the project, on that you are correct.')
('Professor Cronkite', 'However, I lost interest in the project itself as soon as<br/>the development work was complete.')
('System', "I thought I'd finally be free once the ceremony<br/>concluded, but these two weren't having any of it.")
('Cao', "I wasn't about to pass up the opportunity to have a<br/>talk with the famous Professor Cronkite, after all.")
('Van', 'If only you two could talk about anything not shady<br/>as all hell.')
('Cao', 'Not at all! I simply wanted to make<br/>casual conversation.')
('Cao', "If you're looking for someone plotting shady schemes,<br/>you should speak with my friend here.")
('General Manager Thorndyke', 'Heh. Very amusing.')
('General Manager Thorndyke', 'I simply came over to invite the good professor to join<br/>our company. We would very much appreciate<br/>his talent.')
('General Manager Thorndyke', 'Alas, he rejected my advances.')
('Professor Cronkite', "My current contract won't be expiring any time soon,<br/>I'm afraid.")
('General Manager Thorndyke', "Maybe if I'd been quicker about my approach... No, I<br/>suspect this contract of yours has been in place for<br/>quite a while now...")
('General Manager Thorndyke', "Perhaps even before talks of reinventing Calvard's<br/>military even began?")
('Professor Cronkite', "I haven't the faintest idea what you are implying.")
('Professor Cronkite', 'But I will have to admit I am curious about what<br/>research goes on behind closed doors at Marduk.')
('Professor Cronkite', 'I suspect you have access to a lot of technology that<br/>even Verne does not.')
('Cao', 'For our part, Heiyue is greatly interested in the<br/>research of both.')
('Professor Cronkite', '...')
('General Manager Thorndyke', 'Hahaha.')
('Cao', 'Heh.')
('Van', '(Shady to their core, all three of them.)')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', 'Oh, speak of the devil.')
('Risette', 'Good day to you all.')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "Oh, look who it is! I hope you're all having a<br/>great festival!")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "Oh, look who it is! I hope you're all having a<br/>great festival!")
('Naje', "Indeed. I can see you're all hard at work patrolling.")
('Risette', 'Associate Professor Esmeray. Lieutenant Kaela.')
('Van', "And the crown prince's bodyguard here with ya, too?")
('Quatre', "Essy! I see you've got company, too.")
('Van', "And the crown prince's bodyguard here with ya, too?")
('Van', 'Associate Professor Esmeray and the woman from<br/>the CID, huh?')
('Van', "And the crown prince's bodyguard here with ya, too?")
('Van', "Heard the prince told you to patrol just so you'd<br/>finally take a bit of a break?")
('Naje', 'Correct. I was highly reluctant to leave his side,<br/>regardless of the rest of his security personnel being<br/>there with him, but orders are orders.')
('Van', "Guessin' you were also told to patrol so you'd take a<br/>bit of time for yourself.")
('Naje', '*sigh* You truly are sharp.')
('Naje', 'I was highly reluctant to leave his side, regardless of<br/>the rest of his security personnel being there with<br/>him, but orders are orders.')
('Naje', "Still, I intend to return to him fairly soon. After I'm<br/>satisfied with my observation.")
('Van', 'Oh?')
('System', 'Oh?')
('Aaron', 'Oh?')
('Bergard', 'Oh?')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', 'Look over there. Discreetly, mind you.')
('System', "Isn't that...?")
('Aaron', 'Heh. I see now.')
('Bergard', 'Hmm... I understand now.')
('Van', "Yeah. Not surprised you've got your eyes on 'em.<br/>Talk about a triple threat.")
('Van', "Talk about a triple threat. Not surprised you've got<br/>your eyes on 'em.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "I'm not familiar with the purple-haired man, but I<br/>can see why you'd be concerned with having Yang<br/>and that Marduk manager both there.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "Wonder if this meeting has anything to do with<br/>the president? ...No, it feels like it's more than<br/>just that.")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "I haven't heard anything about that meeting myself.")
('Risette', 'I was aware that our general manager was coming to<br/>Edith for the unveiling of the new weapons.')
('Risette', "But I've heard nothing regarding the White<br/>Orchid Dragon. Admittedly, even if I had, I doubt I<br/>would have been at liberty to discuss it...")
('System', 'Risette...')
('Aaron', 'Hmph.')
('Bergard', 'Hmm...')
('Naje', 'You need not feel guilty. We understand that your<br/>job comes with its own restrictions, much like<br/>ours do.')
('Naje', "That's why it's much more appreciated to have you<br/>join us for tea and a chat.")
('Naje', "That's why we appreciate it all the more just how<br/>much you always do to help us.")
('Naje', "You're always so good to us, and we're truly grateful.")
('Risette', 'I am humbled by your kind words, Ms. Berka.')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "Aww! Isn't this nice? We've got a little friends circle<br/>of competent women starting up here!")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "Can I join? I get the impression we're all about the<br/>same age! Let Kaela in, too!")
('Quatre', '...What are you talking about, Essy?')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', 'Wh-Why am I being included in this? Much as this<br/>does feel like a group worth being part of...')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "Still, I'm twenty-one, and I believe Ms. Twinings<br/>is twenty?")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', '...What?')
('Risette', 'My circumstances are a little peculiar, but I am<br/>indeed twenty years old.')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "B-But you're both so cool and composed!<br/>Wh-What about you, Naje?")
('Naje', "Hmm? I'm twenty-five. What of it?")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'Nuh uh!<br/>I was so absolutely SURE you were older than me!')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "I'm almost twenty-eight... Why am I the only one<br/>nearing her third decade?")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "N-No, it's okay... I'm still younger than Yang, and as<br/>long as I keep producing results as a researcher...<br/>*sniffle*")
('Van', "*sigh* You're way too young to be stressin' about<br/>your age.")
('Agnès', "Heehee, I agree.<br/>(She's still young at heart, at least.)")
('Feri', "Don't worry! It barely shows that you're the oldest!<br/>You're still the most childish—er, I mean... You don't<br/>act your age! Wait...")
('Aaron', "For being so close to thirty, you act more like<br/>you're thirteen.")
('Quatre', 'You certainly act like the biggest child of the group...')
('Judith', "I never would've become an actress in the first place if<br/>I let something like my age bother me.")
('Bergard', 'Heh. This is a cute conversation from where I stand.')
('Risette', 'Regardless, I will stay here for the present to liaise<br/>and gather information. Particularly on the<br/>group there.')
('Risette', 'But if you require my aid, please let me know. I will<br/>hurry to your side.')
('Van', 'Will do. Thanks.')
('Risette', 'Still, I suspect there is worth in someone keeping an<br/>eye on them and what they are doing.')
('Risette', 'Perhaps I should handle it in case someone else takes<br/>over my current position in accompanying you?')
('Van', 'Yeah, sounds good to me. Thanks.')
('Van', "(Oh, boy... Good thing I got a warnin', but this is still<br/>sendin' chills down my spine.)")
('Van', 'Oh, boy...')
('Cao', "My! If it isn't Van and one of his dear friends.")
('Professor Cronkite', 'So it is.')
('General Manager Thorndyke', 'A very happy festival to you all. Would you care to<br/>join us for a while?')
('Aaron', '*sigh* What the hell are you doing here, Cao?')
('Risette', 'I had heard you were in Edith, but I was not<br/>expecting to encounter you here, sir.')
('Quatre', 'What are you up to here, Yang? This is such a strange<br/>place to find you.')
('Van', "I knew you and the professor were invited for the<br/>ceremony, but I'm guessin' you're not here to talk<br/>about the new weapons?")
('Van', 'Not with Cao here, anyway.')
('Van', "Unless Heiyue's thinking of introducin' Assault<br/>Frames to their arsenal now?")
('Cao', 'Naturally, we have no such intention.')
('Cao', "Appealing as they are, they do not fit Heiyue any<br/>more than the Empire's Panzer Soldats did.")
('Cao', "Though I am rather curious to know how well they'd<br/>work with regards to martial arts.")
('Professor Cronkite', 'Hmm... I am at least aware of Taito techniques being<br/>used in a Panzer Soldat before.')
('Professor Cronkite', 'And I have no doubt that whatever a Panzer Soldat<br/>can do, an Assault Frame will perform better.<br/>Have you tested them with hollow style already?')
('General Manager Thorndyke', "We certainly did, and saw some success. How viable<br/>it is depends heavily on the pilot's own<br/>skills, however.")
('General Manager Thorndyke', "Once we have established the hollow style's use in<br/>Assault Frames, it may be worth trying Gekka school<br/>techniques as well.")
('Cao', 'Heh. I would be happy to lend you some of our men<br/>for that trial, if you wish.')
('Professor Cronkite', 'Naturally, this is all in jest.')
('Professor Cronkite', 'I originally planned this meeting upon hearing that<br/>Marduk and Heiyue had dealings with one another<br/>during the crisis in Oración.')
('Professor Cronkite', 'As such, I asked their general manager to arrange for<br/>this meeting, thinking this an opportunity that does<br/>not present itself often.')
('Cao', "I'm truly honored to be able to meet you. And am<br/>quite elated to hear you wanted to meet with me<br/>so much.")
('Cao', 'Actually, I heard your father was born in Langport.<br/>Is that right?')
('Professor Cronkite', 'He was, though he left while young and made Basel<br/>his home for the rest of his years.')
('Professor Cronkite', 'I do hear he agonized long and hard on whether to<br/>become a merchant in Langport or a researcher.')
('Cao', 'Fascinating.')
('Cao', "Langport's people do seem particularly inclined to<br/>becoming merchants. Happens often to Easterners<br/>from there.")
('Cao', 'But if a genius researcher like you came from the<br/>same bloodline, clearly that rule is not absolute.')
('Professor Cronkite', "Bloodline matters little to me to begin with.<br/>A person's inclination is decided more by their<br/>individual personality and life experiences.")
('General Manager Thorndyke', 'Heh. I am inclined to agree. When evaluating<br/>potential new hires at Marduk...')
('Van', "I don't trust a lick of what they say, but there's<br/>nothing to really go off of here. Got no clue what<br/>they're up to.")
('Agnès', 'I agree...<br/>(I wonder if Dad is connected to this somehow?)')
('Feri', 'Yeah.<br/>(I wonder if Kasim has anything to do with this.)')
('Aaron', 'Better to just leave them be.')
('Risette', 'Speaking from experience, I agree.<br/>(Though I do wonder why Mr. Thorndyke is<br/>speaking with a member of Heiyue...)')
('Quatre', 'Agreed...<br/>(I wonder if Gran knows?)')
('Judith', "Yeah. Thinking so much about them's just gonna<br/>waste our time.")
('Bergard', 'We should keep their meeting in mind, but I suggest<br/>thinking no more on it.')
('Van', 'Shoot! They called in demons!')
('Shizuna', 'They must be trying to protect it!')
('System', 'Break the Demon Stone?')
('System', 'Break the Demon Stone?')
('System', 'Break the Demon Stone?')
('Lindsey', 'I imagine this is it?')
('Agnès', "Th-Thank you! I'll check right away!")
('Agnès', 'Yes! This stain on the front cover is from when I<br/>spilled tea on it!')
('Van', "So it's definitely your copy, then?")
('Agnès', "It has to be! I'm so relieved to finally have it back...")
('Agnès', "I'd honestly given up on ever finding it. Umm...<br/>Just who are you?")
('Lindsey', "Let's just say I run a bookstore on the other side<br/>of town.")
('Lindsey', "Oh, how unexpected it was to have you call out for<br/>me, the answer to your troubles being right in my<br/>store's lineup!")
('Lindsey', 'May this be fate, bringing us together?')
('Van', "Hell no. Just hearin' you say that's already givin'<br/>me goosebumps.")
('Van', "But thanks anyway. I'll wire you some mira later for<br/>your trouble.")
('Lindsey', "Heehee, don't worry so much about it! I owed you<br/>one, so let's call ourselves even.")
('Lindsey', "Well, I'll leave the two of you be!")
('Agnès', 'Thank you again!')
('Agnès', '(What kind of relationship do the two of them have?<br/>I wonder...)')
('Agnès', "I'm really sorry for all the trouble helping me turned<br/>out to be, Van.")
('Van', "Hey. Like I said, I didn't do it for free. I'll cash in the<br/>favor when you're rich and powerful.")
('Van', "Call it an investment in the future of one of<br/>my employees. Can't have you too bummed out<br/>about it.")
('Agnès', '(*sigh* If you say so.)')
('Agnès', "I'll do all I can to deliver on your expectations, then!")
('Agnès', "I'm so glad to finally have my book back.")
('Van', 'What a coincidence that one of your favorite book<br/>protagonists has the same name you do.')
('Van', 'Or is that why you like it so much?')
('Agnès', "It's a little embarrassing to admit it, but that's right.")
('Agnès', 'The reason why I asked my parents for it in the first<br/>place was because of the title.')
('Agnès', "But that's just the start of it. The real reason why I<br/>treasure it so much is because I admire Agnès'<br/>character so much.")
('Van', "Really? Isn't she like a magician tryin' to blend in<br/>with society?")
('Agnès', "Yes, but what I admire is her determination.<br/>She won't stop at anything to protect what she<br/>cares about, even if it's a danger to herself.")
('Agnès', "It's my comfort book. I'd always go back and read it<br/>whenever I felt like giving up...")
('Agnès', "Then I'd convince myself I was a magician just like<br/>Agnès and push on.")
('Van', 'Heh. Guess we all were children once.')
('Van', "(Though it might've rubbed off on her. She's very<br/>strong-willed herself, for someone her age.)")
('Agnès', 'Huh?')
('Agnès', "D-Don't get the wrong idea! I don't pretend to be<br/>her anymore!")
('Van', "Not what I was thinkin'. But 'anymore' does mean you<br/>used to, yeah?")
('Agnès', '...Oh!')
('Van', "Heh. Anyway, we've still got a bit of free time left.")
('Van', 'I think I got an idea about what you could pay<br/>me with. Why not show me what kinda sweets you<br/>students buy at the department store nowadays?')
('Agnès', "Ahaha. I wouldn't count that as payment. But<br/>let's see...")
('System', 'The two of them began a quick tour of the area in<br/>front of the station before their free time came to<br/>an end.')
('System', 'After that, they returned to work.')
('System', "Van's group decided to take a short break.")
('System', 'Everyone split up so they could spend their free time<br/>as they pleased.')
('Agnès', 'Thank you again for agreeing to come out shopping<br/>with me, Van.')
('Agnès', "I'm only going to buy some personal items, though.<br/>You really didn't have to accompany me.")
('Van', "You got a lengthy shopping list, right? Figured you'd<br/>need some help carryin' it all.")
('Van', "Somethin' about a bunch of art class supplies, yeah?")
('Agnès', "That's right. We're about to start lessons on oil<br/>painting soon.")
('Agnès', "And I don't suspect I'll be able to produce something<br/>I'll be proud of with my current supplies.")
('Agnès', "It's also a good chance to replace some of my older<br/>equipment with better materials, too.")
('Van', "Being a student is really rough on the wallet, huh?<br/>Well, let's see what we can find.")
('Agnès', 'Thank you!')
('Agnès', "It's surprising just how much of a difference in price<br/>there can be between paints that are basically the<br/>same color.")
('Agnès', "And then I have to choose between a 12-color set and<br/>a 24-color set... There's an almost overwhelming<br/>amount of options.")
('Van', 'For sure. The pricier ones are supposed to have more<br/>vibrant colors that fade less and have better coverage.')
('Van', "Not gonna tell you how to spend your money, but do<br/>keep in mind that you're at Aramis of all places.")
('Van', "Tryin' to make do with stuff more suited to your stage<br/>of learning instead of just shooting for top range<br/>goods could be educational in itself.")
('Agnès', "Heehee. Perhaps you're right. Maybe I should go for<br/>something more basic and affordable, then.")
('Agnès', "I'd also like to buy a wide variety of brushes.")
('Agnès', "I have some already, but it's just the beginner set I<br/>bought when I enrolled.")
('Van', "Maybe it'd be worth buying somethin' expensive like<br/>this fan brush, then?")
('Van', 'I know I just said not to shoot for top range goods,<br/>but with brushes, a difference in materials really does<br/>open up a lot of options.')
('Agnès', 'You know a lot more about this than I expected.')
('Agnès', 'Heehee. You do seem to have a lot of<br/>hobbies, though. Is painting one of them?')
('Van', "Uh, no. Not really. Gave it a shot, but I learned real<br/>quick it wasn't for me.")
('Van', "How about this set? Looks like it'd be a perfect match<br/>for you.")
('Agnès', 'Oh? The luxury Aramis the Artist model brush...<br/>Goodness gracious, this is expensive!')
('Van', 'That will be 2,000 mira in total.')
('Agnès', "I'll pay with this, then.")
('Agnès', "I'm quite happy with how that went! It fit perfectly<br/>within my budget, too.")
('Van', "Yeah. Figured you'd end up overspendin', what with<br/>everything you got.")
('Van', "You're good at keepin' to a budget for a rich girl.")
('Agnès', "Heehee. I wouldn't quite describe myself that way,<br/>but I suppose school has forced good habits on me.")
('Agnès', 'I perform a lot of different jobs as part of the<br/>Student Council.')
('Van', 'Heh. Maybe I could use some of those skills back at<br/>the office.')
('Agnès', "Ahaha... I wouldn't mind helping with all there is to<br/>do at the office.")
('System', "Van's group decided to take a short break.")
('System', 'Everyone split up so they could spend their free time<br/>as they pleased.')
('Agnès', "I think this is where we're supposed to meet<br/>with them.")
('Van', 'Oh, look who else is here.')
('Yumé', 'Van! Agnès!')
('Paulette', 'I had the impression this event was just for children.<br/>Are you going to be taking part, too?')
('Agnès', "That's right. I helped them out before when they<br/>were holding the event elsewhere.")
('Agnès', 'They invited me to come to this event as thanks<br/>for that.')
('Van', "And she had an extra spot, so that's why I'm here.<br/>Not that I'm complainin'. I wanted to check the<br/>whole thing out myself.")
('Paulette', "Heehee. I'm a little jealous you get to join in, to<br/>be honest.")
('Paulette', 'Would you mind keeping an eye on Yumé?')
('Van', 'Yeah, I guess I can keep an eye on her.')
('Agnès', "We'll have a lot of fun, Yumé!")
('Yumé', 'Yaaay!')
(40301, "Excellent. I see you've arrived with your guest,<br/>Ms. Claudel.")
(40301, "We're going to make our way to the airport<br/>now, everyone. Stay close behind, and make sure not<br/>to get lost!")
(15085, 'Okay!')
('System', 'Van and Agnès accompanied the children to<br/>the airport.')
('System', 'There, the children were seen off by their parents and<br/>guardians as the whole group climbed on board<br/>the airship.')
('System', "Van's group decided to take a short break.")
('System', 'Everyone split up so they could spend their free time<br/>as they pleased.')
('Feri', "I feel kinda small when I'm in this part of Edith.<br/>It's sooo big!")
('Feri', 'But why are we here?')
('Van', "You've been livin' here for a while, but you still don't<br/>have everything you need to make yourself comfy<br/>here, right?")
('Van', "I'm your boss, so I figured I should pitch in and help<br/>with that.")
('Feri', 'Heehee. Thank you for being so kind!')
('Feri', "Agnès helped me buy some bare minimum necessities<br/>for my room, but you're right. I'm still missing a lot<br/>of stuff.")
('Feri', "I still have some mira left for my move, so I'd like to<br/>buy some more things.")
('Van', "Should do that, then. Last thing I want is your dad<br/>yellin' at me for not takin' good care of you.")
('Van', "You should be able to buy just about everything you<br/>could want in this part of the city. Let's start with the<br/>orbal store first.")
('Feri', 'Got it!')
('Feri', "I've been here before, but it's always overwhelming<br/>how many orbments they have!")
('Van', "Right about what you'd expect, to be honest, since<br/>this is one of the biggest orbal stores in the<br/>whole country.")
('Van', "You wanna look at household orbments first? You can<br/>even try hagglin' the price down a little on the<br/>expensive stuff so it's more reasonable.")
('Feri', 'I was actually hoping to look at night-vision goggles<br/>for combat in the dark and security cameras.')
('Feri', "We need to make upgrading our office's defensive<br/>capabilities a top priority so I can keep you and<br/>Agnès safe!")
('Van', "No, we don't!")
('Van', "Maybe let's just start easy and look at the Xipha<br/>maintenance kits...")
('Van', "That's a lotta stuff you got there.")
('Feri', 'Heehee, I guess! I was planning on making some field<br/>rations for everyone.')
('Feri', 'Mine are quite popular back home, so I thought they<br/>might be useful!')
('Van', "I mean, I'm not really plannin' to take on any jobs<br/>that'll have us livin' out in the jungle for weeks...")
('Van', "...but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't curious about 'em.<br/>What ingredients do you use?")
('Feri', 'A little bit of everything! Assorted grains, dried<br/>fruits, chocolate...')
('Feri', "As well as, umm, a few other things you'll enjoy more<br/>if you don't know what they are.")
('Van', "That is NOT reassurin' me in the way you think<br/>it does.")
('Feri', "Heehee. I'll let you try some of the rations when<br/>they're done. You can give me your feedback then!")
('Van', "I'm not putting anything in my mouth until I know<br/>what it is!")
('Feri', "This is the gun shop? I've heard good things about<br/>the woman that runs it!")
('Van', 'Yeah. Probably gonna be your favorite spot,<br/>considering your rifleblade.')
('Feri', '(I wonder if the gunsmith here could take a look<br/>at it...)')
('Sylvie', "Thanks for waitin'! There's the set of rifleblade<br/>maintenance tools and two cases of ammo you<br/>asked for.")
('Feri', 'Thank you!')
('Van', "Yup. Knew you'd go more for combat stuff today.")
('Feri', 'Of course! It should always be top priority to be<br/>stocked up on combat supplies!')
('Feri', 'I... I do have something else I want to ask about.')
('Feri', 'Do you repair rifles here?')
('Van', 'Oh...')
('Sylvie', "Of course. Why don't you let me have a look at it if<br/>you got it with you?")
('Feri', "It's this one here.")
('Van', "I had a feelin' that's what this was about.")
('Feri', "It's Aida's rifle.")
('Feri', 'The Eisenschild ended up entrusting it to me after<br/>what happened.')
('Feri', "But it's damaged, and pretty badly. She must've<br/>pushed it too much.")
('Feri', "I'd really like to have it repaired, though.")
('Sylvie', "I can tell just by lookin' at it that it's owner really<br/>knew what they were doin'.")
('Sylvie', "It's got some heavy customization. Basically squeezin'<br/>it dry of all the power it had, usability be damned.")
('Sylvie', "But that also means a bunch'a parts here aren't<br/>available on the mass market.")
('Feri', 'Yeah. Aida mentioned it was a special model she had<br/>since before joining the Eisenschild.')
('Van', "I take it that's a nice way of tellin' us it's too much for<br/>you to handle?")
('Sylvie', "Unfortunately, you're right on the money. I hate to<br/>disappoint, but I'd rather be upfront about it.")
('Feri', "Please don't apologize. I'm happy that I got an<br/>expert's opinion.")
('Feri', "Thank you very much! I'm sure I'll be back<br/>again soon!")
('Van', "It's a shame she couldn't do anything to fix it.")
('Feri', "It's okay! I had a feeling this would happen. A jaeger's<br/>weapon is their battle partner. It makes sense no one<br/>would know it as well as she did.")
('Feri', '...')
('Van', "But I'll keep it in mind anyway. Maybe we can find<br/>some other way to fix it.")
('Van', "I take it you don't know of any other places you<br/>could try? Like the corps you're from—oh. Shit.")
('Feri', "Ahaha... Yeah, I can't go and ask them now that<br/>they've disowned me.")
('Feri', "Besides, Aida was like a big sister to me. I wouldn't<br/>like to just pass this duty on to just anyone.")
('Van', 'Makes sense.')
('Van', "(Heard Feri's not the only little sister she left behind.<br/>She had someone else back in her old haunt<br/>Zephyr, too.)")
('Feri', 'Well, thanks for coming around with me today!')
('Feri', "I'll do my best to pull my weight around now that I'm<br/>working for you!")
('Van', "Haha, just don't work yourself too hard, kiddo.")
('System', 'With their shopping (and their break time) over,<br/>the two of them returned to work.')
('Van', 'Thanks for all your hard work, Risette.')
('Van', "You got through all that desk work that was piling up<br/>like it was nothin'.")
('Van', "I feel kinda bad for forcin' you to do all the tedious<br/>jobs, though.")
('Risette', "Please think nothing of it. I'm always happy to be<br/>of service.")
('Risette', "I'm nothing if not pleased to have been able to be of<br/>assistance in your office.")
('Risette', "We'd never been able to interact through anything<br/>other than a screen beforehand...")
('Risette', '...but now I get to go out shopping and have a nice<br/>chat with you physically here.')
('Van', "Weird way of puttin' it, but I see where you're<br/>comin' from.")
(40301, 'Here is the coffee that you ordered.')
('Risette', 'Oh, speaking of orders...')
('Risette', "I wasn't aware prior to me coming here and<br/>accompanying you on your travels just how bad your<br/>sweet tooth is.")
('Van', "Just wanna make it clear that sweets aren't the ONLY<br/>reason we've been goin' on so many business<br/>trips lately.")
('Van', "More of a bonus, yeah? It'd be rude goin' somewhere<br/>and not sampling the local confectionery.")
('Risette', 'Heehee, if you say so.')
('Van', "Aaand you totally didn't buy that. *sigh* Whatever.<br/>Let's drink.")
('Risette', '...Hmm?')
('Risette', 'This is rather hotter than I was expecting.')
('Van', 'Holy shit!')
('Van', "This is WAY too hot! Did a rookie screw up<br/>or somethin'?")
('Van', "Though yours doesn't look as hot as mine...")
('Risette', "We can't be so sure of that. Our difference in reaction<br/>should not be how you gauge it. I handle hot things<br/>better than most do.")
('Risette', 'I still think it would be wise to get some milk to cool<br/>it down, though.')
('Risette', 'Excuse me!')
('Van', '(...)')
('System', 'They called a member of staff over and explained<br/>the situation.')
('System', 'The staff member apologized profusely for the issue<br/>and added some milk as requested to cool the<br/>drinks down.')
(40301, 'We truly are sorry for the issue with your coffee!')
(40301, 'Here are the pancakes you ordered as well.')
('Risette', "Oh? I don't recall ordering any pancakes.")
('Risette', 'Was it you who ordered them, Mr. Arkride? If so, let<br/>me hand you the plate.')
('Van', "Nope. It's right where it needs to be.")
('Van', "Just think of 'em as a little bonus.")
('Van', "A small thanks for all you've done for us, even in such<br/>a short time.")
('Van', "There's more to life than just work. You should at<br/>least find the time to enjoy somethin' sweet once in<br/>a while.")
('Risette', 'Heehee. Thank you very much.')
('Risette', "I wasn't expecting to get such a pleasant bonus so<br/>soon after starting work. I can see this is a workplace<br/>that values its employees after all.")
('Van', 'Doubt we can compare to whatever crazy welfare<br/>program Marduk has, but we try.')
('Van', "It's good to have you on the team, Risette.")
('Risette', 'And it is likewise my pleasure being part of the team,<br/>Mr. Arkride.')
('Risette', "Though it'd feel awfully rude to sit and enjoy this<br/>plate of pancakes while you just sit and watch.<br/>You're the one with the sweet tooth, after all.")
('Risette', "Why don't you have some, too?")
('Van', "I...am kinda regretting not orderin' any for<br/>myself, yeah.")
('Van', "All right. If you're sure, I wouldn't mind a few.")
('System', 'Van and Risette enjoyed the remainder of their time<br/>together before resuming their patrol.')
('System', "Van's group decided to take a short break.")
('System', 'Everyone split up so they could spend their free time<br/>as they pleased.')
('FIO', 'Report: Your purchases fit perfectly within<br/>your budget.')
('Van', 'Perfect.')
('Van', "Man, havin' an expert on board really comes in handy<br/>when you're out shopping. Thanks, man. We got<br/>some nice deals on high quality equipment there.")
('Quatre', "Don't mention it. As long as I'm working out of your<br/>office, the stability of its orbal network access is really<br/>important to me. I was happy to help.")
('Quatre', 'If anything, I was surprised by how accommodating<br/>you were to everything I asked for.')
('Van', "Well, Risette's the software specialist, you're the<br/>hardware specialist.")
('Van', "I obviously don't have bottomless pockets so I can't<br/>accommodate for everything, but I trust your<br/>judgment on this.")
('Quatre', '...')
('Van', "What's up?")
('Quatre', "It's just...you're much different than would be<br/>expected from someone running a shady business<br/>like yours.")
('Quatre', "You barely know me. Taking that into account, I<br/>wouldn't expect you to extend such freedom and trust<br/>to me.")
('Van', "Hey, you're the expert here. I'm not gonna butt in<br/>when I'm aware you know better than I do.")
('Van', "Arkride Solutions keeps growin' and growin'.<br/>Y'all have your unique skills, and I'm not about to go<br/>wastin' them.")
('Van', "So why not take advantage of my employees'<br/>knowledge, then?")
('Quatre', "I'm...inclined to agree, when you put it that way.")
('Van', "'Kay, then. Let's haul this stuff back to the office.<br/>Trust you can handle the installation?")
('Quatre', 'Of course—')
('FIO', 'Orbal abnormality detected in the vicinity.')
('Van', 'Uhh...')
('Quatre', 'I wonder if something happened?')
('Van', "The big screen's gone off.")
('Quatre', "I wonder if it's lost power? ...No, there's some digital<br/>noise still present, so it can't be that. It must be a<br/>hardware failure.")
('Quatre', "I'm going to go and speak to the person in charge.")
('FIO', 'Understood.')
('Van', 'Hold up!')
('System', "Quatre went to speak to the store's owner—who was<br/>just as perplexed and agreed to let him handle<br/>repairing the screen.")
('Quatre', "FIO, I need a full scan of the building's structure<br/>and wiring.")
('Quatre', 'XEROS, I need you to sniff out any signs of orbal<br/>leaks and burn-in.')
('FIO', 'Understood. Commencing scan.')
('XEROS', 'RUFF!')
(40301, 'Wh-What are those things?!')
('Van', "*sigh* You really couldn't stop yourself from buttin' in<br/>on this one, could you?")
('Quatre', "Excuse me? 'Butting in'? This is about someone who<br/>clearly needs assistance. Someone I can help.")
('Quatre', "Gran's always said that the ultimate goal of<br/>technology and science should be helping people.")
('Quatre', 'So if I have the ability to be of assistance, then I will<br/>do everything in my power to help them.')
('Van', "Guess no one's gonna fault Professor Hamilton for<br/>dreamin' big.")
('Van', "But you gotta cool it. You ain't one of the<br/>three disciples. Those're some big, BIG shoes you're<br/>not gonna be able to fill.")
('Van', "There ain't enough hours in the day to solve every<br/>problem you come across.")
('Quatre', "...So that's one of your principles as a spriggan, is it?")
('Van', 'Not a principle. Call it life experience.')
('FIO', 'Analysis complete, Quatre. Sending data.')
('XEROS', 'GRR... RUFF!')
('Quatre', 'Thanks, you two.')
('Quatre', "If you're so pressed for time, Van, then you're more<br/>than free to leave. I can handle the rest myself.")
('Van', '*sigh* Teenagers...')
('System', 'Quatre, FIO, and XEROS set about investigating the<br/>cause of the malfunction.')
('System', 'They searched top to bottom and floor to wall to find<br/>the supposed faulty wiring.')
(40301, "Welp, I'm at a loss.")
('Quatre', 'This is more difficult than I anticipated...')
('Quatre', 'I was so certain this was a case of cable<br/>thermal degradation.')
('Quatre', 'Was I wrong? Is the cause something else...?')
('Van', "You're overthinkin' this, bud.")
('Quatre', "...If you don't intend to offer any actionable solutions,<br/>then kindly shut it.")
('Van', "Damn. Aren't we snippy?")
('Van', "Fine, I'll help. FIO's scanner is shard-based, yeah?")
('Van', "Tell 'em to do an ultrasound and infrared scan of<br/>the area.")
('Quatre', 'What? Why?')
('Van', "Just give it a try. If I'm right, problem solved. If I'm<br/>wrong, you get to launch a snark attack. It's<br/>a win-win.")
('FIO', 'The source of the problem has been identified.')
('Quatre', 'A-Are you for real?!')
('Van', "Shard search function comin' in clutch.")
('Van', "Tech's still in its infancy, though. There've been a few<br/>cases where it couldn't detect a degraded circuit.")
('Van', "That came up during one of Marduk's tests a while<br/>back, but it looks like luck's on our side today.")
('Quatre', '...')
('Van', "You got any replacement parts for 'em?")
('Quatre', '...FIO.')
('FIO', 'Commencing search for compatible components.')
('System', 'The screen was successfully repaired, and Station<br/>Street was restored to its usual lively form.')
('Van', "*sigh* We literally can't catch a break. Finally get<br/>some free time—and then work gobbles it up.")
('Quatre', 'My prior assessment was on point, it seems.<br/>You really are a strange person.')
('Quatre', "One second you're heckling from the sidelines, the<br/>next you're giving me a hand.")
('Van', "Any boss worth their salt helps their employees when<br/>they're in a bind. What I did wasn't out of<br/>the ordinary.")
('Van', 'Plus we gotta set up the stuff we bought, so the<br/>sooner I can get you back, the better.')
('Van', "C'mon, let's go. We don't got all day.")
('Quatre', 'I still have much to learn.')
('Quatre', "And there's more knowledge to be gained under his<br/>tutelage than I expected.")
('Quatre', 'I need to make the most of this opportunity. I want<br/>to have grown by leaps and bounds by the time I see<br/>Gran again.')
('System', 'Van and Quatre returned to the office and installed<br/>the parts they purchased.')
('System', 'Afterwards, they reunited with the others and got<br/>back to work.')
('Judith', "The footmarks are faint, but they're visible.")
('Van', "It's pretty clear our perp's runnin' on the rooftops.")
('Judith', 'They have the gall to steal my name, but not<br/>my methods?! I run on walls, damn it! Not rooftops!')
('Van', "Guess they're a lousy Grimcat copycat, huh?")
('Van', "They aren't just targeting the rich and corrupt, either.<br/>They've widened the scope to ordinary citizens.")
('Van', 'And that just makes them a common thug.')
('Judith', "No, they're worse than that. They're pure and<br/>utter scum.")
('Judith', "Grimcat is a virtuous thief who only steals to punish<br/>the wicked—and this dirtbag's only interested in<br/>lining their own pockets!")
('Van', 'Damn. You sure are pissed about this.')
('Judith', 'And how could I not be?!')
('Judith', 'I inherited the mantle from Mom and Grammy.<br/>That role means the world to me!')
('Judith', "No, it's not just that. This is the way of life I've<br/>believed in since I was a little girl.")
('Judith', 'And I happen to be very proud of it!')
('Judith', "So of course I'm angry. The name is being dragged<br/>through the mud by a money-grubbing asshole!")
('Van', 'All right. Time to rein it in.')
('Van', "I get why you're mad as hell, but I'm gonna need you<br/>to cool your jets before we go after the impostor.")
('Van', "You might be a superpowered, badass thief lady, but<br/>you're still human. One careless move, and it could be<br/>curtains for us.")
('Judith', 'Ugh... Fine, I get the picture. I guess I am a little<br/>heated right now.')
('Judith', "I've gotta ask, though, since it's on my mind. Why are<br/>you going this far to help me out? I thought you<br/>didn't work for free.")
('Van', "The copycat only started prowlin' the streets this past<br/>week, yeah?")
('Van', "If you weren't so busy helpin' us clean up the mafia,<br/>you'd've mopped the floor with this two-bit crook<br/>by now.")
('Van', "You're kinda in this mess 'cause of me, so I figured I<br/>should pay back the debt I owe.")
('Judith', '...')
('Van', "Hey, why're you givin' me that look?")
('Judith', "Oh, nothing. It's just that—while I do appreciate the<br/>help and everything—something you said rubbed me<br/>the wrong way.")
('Judith', "It's always 'pay off my debt' this or 'settle my debt'<br/>that with you. Doing favors isn't like paying off a bar<br/>tab, you know.")
('Van', '...')
('Van', "Heh. You aren't one to pull your punches, are you?")
('Judith', "You've got that right. I like to be frank with people—<br/>whether they're a close friend or a complete stranger.")
('Judith', "And while I'm on a roll, I might as well tell you you're<br/>not off the hook for that little incident in Longlai.")
('Van', "And here I was thinkin' what happened in Longlai<br/>would stay in Longlai.")
('Van', "Why don't I just turn the other cheek? Will another<br/>slap help you forgive and forget?")
('Judith', "No way! I won't let you off that easy!")
('System', 'Some time later...')
('Van', 'Hey again.')
('Van', "Wow. We've met twice in one day. What are<br/>the chances?")
('Elaine', "You're playing it off like it's a coincidence, but I<br/>suspect this was very much deliberate.")
('Elaine', 'I could arrest you for stalking, you know.')
('Van', "Oh, don't be like that. I just wanted to give somethin'<br/>to you.")
('Van', 'Here you go.')
('Elaine', 'Is this...a Mishy plush?')
('Van', "Yep. This thing's merch for the Mishy in Boots<br/>movie that's comin' next month. You can only get it<br/>in theaters for a limited time.")
('Van', 'You have no idea how long I had to wait in line for it.')
('Elaine', 'Why did you go out of your way to do that for me?')
('Van', "Well, I figured you wanted one 'cause you looked like<br/>you were dyin' to see it.")
('Elaine', "I-I don't want to see it THAT much.")
('Elaine', "...But even if I did, that doesn't mean you had to get<br/>this for me.")
('Van', "Well, that wasn't the only reason.")
('Van', 'I, uh, just happened to remember about that promise<br/>I broke all those years ago.')
('Van', "I know giving you this thing won't fully make up<br/>for it...")
('Elaine', "...You aren't wrong.")
('Elaine', "Also, did you just refer to Mishy as 'this thing'? Rude.")
('Van', "Oh, umm... Sorry 'bout that. Anyway, catch ya later.")
('Elaine', "So there's a theme park in Crossbell called<br/>Mishelam Wonderland? Well, that's new.")
('Elaine', 'And this is its mascot...')
('Kincaid', "We're back. ...Hmm? What are you reading there?")
('Van', "Looks like it's some news from Crossbell.<br/>Anyway, what's this cat-lookin' thing? 'Mishy'?")
('Van', "It looks ugly as hell. Don't tell me you like that thing?")
('Elaine', "I-I'm allowed to like whatever I want! I'm sorry my<br/>tastes aren't up to your standards!")
('Kincaid', "Heh. It's always good to see you two getting along<br/>so well.")
('Kincaid', "Crossbell is only one station away on the<br/>Transcontinental Railroad. Why don't you take a<br/>part-time job so you can take her next year?")
('Van', "Don't push me into it.")
('Van', "...So, umm, what're you thinkin'? If you really wanna<br/>go, I, uh...")
('Elaine', "Really? You'd take me?")
('Elaine', "...Ahem. I mean, if you'd really like to take me that<br/>badly, I suppose I can come along.")
('Van', "You just can't be cute, can you?")
('Elaine', "You're one to talk, Mister Dark and Brooding.<br/>Heehee. Thank you, Van. I can hardly wait to go.")
('Elaine', "Does he have any idea how many years it's been<br/>since then?")
('Elaine', "Still, I'm...happy he remembered.")
('System', 'Afterwards, Van reunited the others and got back<br/>to work.')
('System', "Van's group decided to take a short break.")
('System', 'Everyone split up so they could spend their free time<br/>as they pleased.')
(40302, 'There you are!')
('Elaine', "You're both awfully early.")
(40302, "Heehee. We hopped on an early train 'cause we<br/>reaaaally wanted to see you!")
('Van', '(These are the siblings you met, right?)')
('Elaine', "(Yes. They're the ones who were abducted in that<br/>case last year.)")
('Van', 'September of last year?')
('Van', "That was when you took down a criminal group that<br/>was workin' for Almata, yeah?")
('Elaine', "That's right. It was the case that led to me accepting<br/>my promotion to A-rank.")
('Elaine', "I didn't realize you knew about the incident.")
('Van', 'Bermotti told me all about it. Sounded like it was a<br/>rough ordeal.')
('Elaine', 'You can say that again. The two children survived,<br/>but they were left traumatized by what happened.')
('Elaine', "They've been receiving care in a facility outside the<br/>city ever since, but they're coming to the capital for<br/>the Revolution Festival.")
('Elaine', 'I was told they really want to see me, so I agreed to<br/>look after them for half a day.')
('Van', "No wonder you came runnin' to me for advice.")
('Elaine', "Hey, it's not as though I'm bad at dealing<br/>with children. I just don't know how to keep<br/>them entertained.")
('Van', "Yeah, you don't exactly strike me as the fun-loving<br/>babysitter type.")
('Van', "I thought your bracer work would've forced you to<br/>learn all the good spots in town, but I guess not.")
('Elaine', 'Yes, yes. Rub it in.')
('Elaine', "Do you know any places they might enjoy? You're the<br/>expert in slacking off, so I thought you would know.")
('Van', 'Only you would ask for help and toss an insult my<br/>way in the same breath.')
('Van', "Just so we're clear, I might know a few good places—<br/>but they won't necessarily be fun for kids. That okay<br/>with you?")
('Elaine', "Yes, that's perfectly fine. Thank you.")
('Elaine', 'I also need to know where to find some good<br/>quality sweets.')
('Van', "Heh. Well, you've come to the right person, then.")
('Van', "I'll map out a route that'll take you to every<br/>underrated sweets shop in the capital.")
('Elaine', "I...don't think that's necessar—")
('Van', 'Would you like the cost-effective tour or the<br/>no-expenses-spared premium route?')
('Van', "Actually, I have just the thing for you: a special<br/>seasonal route that'll take you to all the best sweet<br/>shops and tourist spots in the city.")
('Van', 'You can leave all your gourmet needs to me!')
('Van', '(Okay, I think she can take this from here.)')
(40302, "We aren't interrupting your date, are we?")
('Van', "You don't need to worry about that, kiddo. I just<br/>came with her to make sure she got here okay.")
(40302, "That's good. I did think you looked a little old for<br/>her, but I was worried we spoiled your fun by<br/>coming early.")
('Van', 'Hang on a sec.')
('Van', 'You got it all wrong. The two of us are the same age.')
(40302, "What? Really? I never would've guessed.")
('Elaine', 'Heehee. I can hardly blame you. He could easily pass<br/>as a 30-something-year-old.')
('Van', 'Oh, so this is the thanks I get. I see how it is.')
(40302, 'Come on. Say hello.')
(40301, '...')
('Van', '(Is she...mute?)')
('Elaine', '(Unfortunately, yes. She lost the ability to speak after<br/>what she went through.)')
('Elaine', "(It doesn't look like she's recovered. Try not to excite<br/>or upset her too much.)")
('System', 'Van gave the girl some candy.')
(40301, '...?')
('Van', "This is my way of sayin' hi. I'm a big fan of<br/>that brand.")
('Van', "I know you'll be headin' back home tonight, but I<br/>hope you have loads of fun till then. Festivals are a<br/>blast, so enjoy it.")
('Van', 'Huh?')
(40302, 'Do you want him to join us?')
('Elaine', 'Would you be okay with that, Van?')
('Van', "All right. It's not like I have any urgent business to<br/>take care of.")
('Van', "Helpin' you plan the route got me in the mood to<br/>stuff my face with sweets anyway.")
('Elaine', "Just don't go spoiling them, okay?")
('Van', 'I know, I know. Well, you kiddos ready to get going?')
(40302, 'Yep!')
('System', 'Van and Elaine led the two children on a tour of<br/>the festival.')
('System', "They brought them to many of Edith's best sweets<br/>stores and tourist spots.")
('System', "To Van and Elaine's delight, the children were<br/>enjoying themselves immensely, and they could feel<br/>the two of them opening up little by little.")
('System', 'Eventually, they set off for Old Town—their final<br/>stop on the tour.')
('System', 'Afterwards, they capped off their day with a light<br/>lunch and dessert at Montmart.')
('System', "Once they finished eating, they all made their way<br/>back to Central Station—as it was time for the kids'<br/>mother to pick them up.")
(40303, 'Thank you both so much!')
(40302, "We had a ton of fun. I hope we'll see you both<br/>again someday!")
('Elaine', 'As do I. Take care of yourselves, you two.')
('Van', "You're both welcome here anytime.")
('Van', "What's up? You forget somethin'?")
(40301, 'Thank...you.')
(40301, 'Bye bye!')
('Elaine', 'Van...')
('Van', 'Yeah, I know.')
('Van', "Hey, why're you turnin' on the waterworks?")
('Elaine', "I'm just...so happy.")
('Van', "Got'cha. Well, I think this is proof that everyone's<br/>efforts weren't for nothing. They recovered 'cause of<br/>the rehab, their family's love and care...")
('Van', '...and what you just did for them.')
('Elaine', "What 'we' just did for them, you mean.")
('Elaine', 'Thank you for everything today, Van.')
('Van', "Nah, I don't deserve it. You did all the heavy lifting.")
('Van', "But if you insist on letting me share the credit, we'll<br/>just say you owe me one now. Always happy to put an<br/>A-rank bracer in my debt.")
('Elaine', '*sniffle* You really are unbelievable, you know that?')
('Elaine', "But while you can be frustrating sometimes, I'm glad<br/>you're a part of my life.")
('Elaine', "We both have our flaws, but I think we compensate<br/>for each other's quite nicely.")
('Elaine', "There's nothing we can't handle when we're together,<br/>and that's especially true when René's with us.<br/>We also have your assistants at our side, too.")
('Van', "...Yeah. You're right.")
('System', 'Van bid Elaine farewell, and he returned to his work.')
('Manager Deborah', 'A pleasure doing business with you as always!')
('Manager Deborah', "I'll throw in some seasonal fruits from Ored on<br/>the house. Hope you enjoy them!")
('Yumé', 'Ooh! These look really tasty!')
('Paulette', "I appreciate the offer, but I couldn't possibly take<br/>these without paying for them.")
('Manager Deborah', 'Of course you can! Think of it as a loyalty bonus.')
('Manager Deborah', "I'd also like to spoil my favorite little Yumé.")
('Yumé', "Yay! I'm her favorite!")
('Van', "Oww... Pipe down. You're killin' my eardrums here.")
('Manager Deborah', "Haha. Children are just so full of energy, aren't they?")
('Manager Deborah', 'I remember when you returned with her in your arms<br/>all those years ago. I was quite worried back then.')
('Yumé', 'Huh?')
('Van', '...')
('Manager Deborah', "But I see now there was no cause for concern.<br/>You've got a good head on your shoulders, and you're<br/>strong of spirit as well.")
('Paulette', 'Heehee. I imagine I got the former from my mom<br/>and the latter from my dad.')
('System', 'They continued their shopping spree for a while<br/>longer before making their way back to Old Town.')
('System', 'Van made his way over to the station to see a street<br/>musician performance.')
('Van', "(I can see why people've been ravin' about her.<br/>She's pretty damn good.)")
('Van', '(Wait. She looks kinda familiar...)')
('Nina', 'Thank you, everyone! I love you! I hope we<br/>meet again!')
(40301, 'You were great today!')
(40302, "I can't wait to hear your next song!")
(40303, "I'll be back again for sure!")
('Nina', "Hmm? Sorry, but I'm done for today.")
('Van', "Just here to say I liked your performance.<br/>Ever thought of putting a single out? It'd sell like<br/>hotcakes for sure.")
('Nina', 'Haha. Thanks for the vote of confidence.')
('Nina', "However, there's no shortage of capable artists out<br/>there who can write and perform at my level.<br/>The music industry is hard to break into.")
('Van', "That's definitely true for no-name artists.")
('Van', 'But you and I both know your songs would take the<br/>world by storm if you used your real name.')
('Nina', "...Let's continue this conversation elsewhere, shall we?")
('Nina', "I'm surprised you saw through my disguise.")
('Nina', "I even changed the tone of my voice. How'd you<br/>know it was me?")
('Van', "It mostly came down to luck. I wasn't one hundred<br/>percent sure, myself.")
('Van', "If I only knew you from your movies, you'd've had me<br/>fooled for sure.")
('Van', "But I've seen you up close and personal several times<br/>at this point.")
('Nina', '*sigh* I need to get my act together.')
('Nina', "I've never been found out before now, so maybe I was<br/>getting a little careless.")
('Van', "This isn't the first time I've seen you in a disguise, by<br/>the way. I saw you in an Aramis outfit once.")
('Nina', 'Oh, you remember that?')
('Van', "Yeah, it left an impression on me. You were actin'<br/>different from usual back then, too.")
('Van', "So, you like doin' stuff like this?")
('Nina', 'I do. I enjoy going out in disguise from time to time.<br/>It makes for good practice as well.')
('Nina', "When I'm on a set, everyone knows I'm playing<br/>a part.")
('Nina', "But when I'm out in the wild, I can take on any role I<br/>want, and no one would know I'm acting.")
('Nina', "It's made for a fun little hobby.")
('Van', "So you're acting on the clock and in your downtime?")
('Van', 'Damn. Talk about being dedicated to your craft.')
('Nina', "Haha. I suppose I just can't get enough of it.")
('Nina', "Although, it mostly stems from a complex I've had<br/>since I was a child. I don't exactly have a distinct self.")
('Nina', "Perhaps that's why I've always wanted to act like<br/>someone else—and why I ultimately gravitated<br/>to acting.")
('Nina', "Or maybe I just wanted something that'd help me<br/>avert my eyes from that uncomfortable truth.")
('Nina', "My motivation for choosing this career path is<br/>purely selfish. I'm sure my fans would be let down if<br/>they knew.")
('Van', "Eh. I wouldn't call that selfish.")
('Van', "It's normal to want to change somethin' you don't like<br/>about yourself.")
('Nina', 'You think so?')
('Van', 'I know so.')
('Van', "That said, your hobby's only gonna get harder the<br/>higher up you get on the ladder of fame.")
('Van', 'But I doubt you need me to tell you that.')
('Nina', 'Yes, I know that all too well.')
('Nina', 'The risk of me getting recognized will only grow as I<br/>get more famous...')
('Nina', '...but the mounting challenge will only serve to make<br/>success all the more sweet.')
('Van', "All that talk about you not havin' a distinct self was a<br/>big, fat lie.")
('Nina', 'What do you...?')
('Van', "You said it yourself. 'The challenge makes success all<br/>the more sweet.'")
('Van', 'Those are the words of someone who gets fired up<br/>when the odds are stacked against them.')
('Van', "That's a pretty unique quality—and it's one that no<br/>one I know has.")
('Nina', '...')
('Nina', "Heehee. It's not half as unique as your willingness to<br/>turn people's words against them.")
('Van', "Hey, I'm just tryin' to help a friend believe in<br/>themselves a little.")
('Nina', "Oh, I know. I'm only teasing you a little.")
('Nina', 'Really, though, thank you. I feel better about<br/>this now.')
('Van', 'Glad to help.')
('Nina', "Anyway, please don't tell anyone about this hobby<br/>of mine.")
('Nina', "I'd like it to be our special little secret. ♪")
('Van', 'Uhh... Sure thing.')
('Van', "(She really knows how to knock you off your feet.<br/>Guess she ain't an award-winning actress for nothin'.)")
('System', 'After Nina departed, Van resumed his patrol<br/>once more.')
('System', "Sylvie, who had been previously consulted about the<br/>rifle's damages, agreed to assist with its repairs.")
('System', 'Van watched over the whole process and helped with<br/>basic tasks like polishing as needed.')
('System', 'Eventually...')
('Fie', 'Well, would you look at that?')
('Feri', '...!')
('Van', "It's right back to the way it was. Ain't that somethin'?")
('Fie', 'It even has the same custom rifle muzzle she used<br/>back in her Zephyr days.')
('Fie', 'It maximized its firepower and improved its accuracy.')
('Fie', 'She really liked talking about that thing.')
('Feri', 'I can see why.')
('Feri', "It's been customized in other ways, too. The weight<br/>distribution probably makes it unwieldy to anyone<br/>who isn't a rifle pro.")
('Feri', 'But Aida had no problem handling it. She and this<br/>rifle were a match made in heaven.')
('Fie', "No doubt about that. I'm glad we were able to get it<br/>fixed up for her.")
('Van', "Heh. The Flameeater couldn't have asked for a better<br/>pair of sisters.")
('Van', "So, what're you plannin' to do with it now?")
('Fie', "That's a good question.")
('Fie', 'How would you feel about using it, Feri?')
('Feri', "I don't think a rifle of this size would suit me, to<br/>be honest.")
('Feri', "Aida once told me to remain true to my own style.<br/>I don't think I'd be honoring her if I changed mine to<br/>adapt to her weapon.")
('Fie', "Figured you'd say something like that. It doesn't fit<br/>mine, either.")
('Feri', 'I have a better idea. How about we deliver it to the<br/>current members of Zephyr?')
('Van', 'Ah, yeah. I heard they reformed after the war.')
('Fie', "Yep. It's changed hands since then. Now it's being led<br/>by two of its former regimental commanders, Xeno<br/>and Leo.")
('Fie', "I'm fine with giving it over to them, but are you sure<br/>that's what you want?")
('Feri', "Yes. I've thought long and hard about it.")
('Feri', 'In her final moments, Aida said the names of her<br/>Zephyr comrades—including you.')
('Feri', 'I can tell she treasured her family there.')
('Feri', "That's why I want to return it to them.")
('Fie', 'Okay. That works for me.')
('Fie', "I'll go ahead and arrange for it to be delivered, then.")
('Van', "Oh? How're you gonna do that?")
('Van', "You do realize a civilian courier can't just waltz into<br/>Zephyr turf with a rifle in hand, right?")
('Fie', "Well aware. That's not what I had in mind.")
('Fie', 'I know someone named Josette who owns a<br/>delivery company. Her people should be able to get it<br/>over to them without much trouble.')
('Van', "Ah, I've heard of them. They're based in Liberl, yeah?")
('Van', "You sure know a lotta people, don'tcha?")
('Fie', 'I could say the same about you.')
('System', 'Fie got in contact with the courier, who happily<br/>accepted the task and got straight to work.')
('System', 'Afterwards, she reached out to Zephyr—who were in<br/>a remote region of the continent—to give them a<br/>heads up.')
('Fie', "It won't be long before it's delivered, so can you stick<br/>around your base camp for a while longer?")
('Feri', 'Sure thing. We had to kill some time before our next<br/>job anyway.')
('Van', "A jaeger's weapon is their very soul. We will take<br/>good care of it.")
('Van', 'The three of us fought side by side many times as<br/>regimental commanders. She is dearly missed.')
('Feri', "The Eisenschild told us about what happened to her.<br/>It's strange to think a part of her will be comin' back<br/>to us.")
('Feri', "I'd like to think she's sharin' a laugh and a drink with<br/>the boss on the other side right about now.")
('Feri', 'Probably stressing all about her little sisters, too.<br/>The worrywart.')
('Fie', "Heh. Wouldn't shock me.")
('Fie', 'It was good talking to you both again. See<br/>you around.')
('Van', "Likewise. Give our regards to Aida's other little sister.")
('Feri', "Sounds like she's gotten herself caught up in<br/>somethin' fishy. Tell her to take care of herself.")
('Van', 'Well, that settles that.')
('Feri', 'You must be one of the only bracers in the guild who<br/>keeps in touch with jaegers.')
('Fie', "We don't talk that often, but they reach out to me<br/>every now and then.")
('Fie', "Now that we've got that squared away, I think I'm<br/>gonna drop by a café.")
('Fie', "Wanna come with? I can share some stories about<br/>Aida and Zephyr, if you're interested.")
('Feri', "Really?! Oh, I'd love that!")
('Feri', 'And I can tell you some about my people and<br/>our village.')
('Fie', "Cool. I'd like to hear all about them.")
('System', 'Fie and Feri went off to enjoy some tea<br/>and conversation.')
('System', 'Once Feri returned, the group got back to work.')
('Van', 'Looks like my guess was right on the mark.')
('Van', "Somethin' on your mind, Inspector?")
('Inspector Daswani', '...What do you want?')
('Van', "Just been looking into a spicy rumor that's been<br/>floatin' around.")
('Van', "Something about a scary-looking man who's prowling<br/>the night searching for little girl toys.")
('Van', "Hey, don't worry. I don't judge. Everyone's got at<br/>least one weird hobby or two.")
('Inspector Daswani', "I-It's not a hobby, damn it. I ought to find the lowlife<br/>scumbag who spread that rumor and cuff them!")
('Van', "All right, I've had my fun. There's more to the<br/>story, right?")
('Van', "What, you tryin' to placate your adolescent daughter<br/>after upsetting her?")
('Van', "...Don't tell me I just hit the jackpot.")
('Inspector Daswani', "Not quite. My daughter's still Sunday School age.")
('Van', "So you couldn't be there for her birthday, huh?")
('Van', "Yeah, just about any little kid's gonna be upset<br/>about that. You're lucky she's mature enough to not<br/>throw a tantrum over it.")
('Inspector Daswani', "I don't need you to tell me that.")
('Inspector Daswani', "I don't get to spend much time with her, so I<br/>promised I'd absolutely be there for her birthday.")
('Van', 'You should know better than to make promises you<br/>might not be able to keep.')
('Van', 'The only absolute in this world is that there are<br/>no absolutes.')
('Inspector Daswani', "All right. I've just about had enough of you.")
('Inspector Daswani', "I'm going to head to another shop. This one didn't<br/>have what I wanted.")
('Van', "What're you tryin' to find, anyway?")
('Inspector Daswani', '...Why do you want to know? So you can fling more<br/>insults my way?')
('Van', "'Cause I wanted to help you find it.")
('Van', 'Figured this was a perfect opportunity to put a cop in<br/>my debt.')
('Inspector Daswani', 'That tone of yours is exactly what I despi—')
('Van', "You must really wanna put a smile back on your<br/>daughter's face—or you wouldn't be roamin' the<br/>streets like a bloodhound on the hunt.")
('Van', "And I'm guessin' you don't wanna ask the guild or<br/>your subordinates for help when they're so busy. But I<br/>got all the time in the world.")
('Van', "I'll help you out of this jam for dirt cheap—just<br/>this once. Whaddaya say?")
('Inspector Daswani', "Bah. You're as unpredictable as ever.")
('Inspector Daswani', "I'm looking for a limited edition dressup doll. It has a<br/>special outfit.")
('Inspector Daswani', "My daughter wants it badly, but unfortunately, so<br/>does everyone else. They're out of stock all over<br/>the city. Trust me, I checked.")
('Van', "So even an inspector like you is willin' to cast<br/>aside his pride for his beloved daughter.")
('Van', 'I think I might know just the place.')
('Inspector Daswani', 'You do?! Tell me where it is, now!')
('Van', "Easy. You can't go there alone. If you do, you won't<br/>be able to get your hands on it, and you'll probably<br/>land yourself in a real mess.")
('Van', "If people there find out who you are, you'll be gettin'<br/>sandbagged in no time.")
('Inspector Daswani', "You don't mean...")
('Inspector Daswani', "I'll be having dinner with my family today for the first<br/>time in a while.")
('Inspector Daswani', 'I really want to hand my daughter the doll then<br/>and there.')
('Inspector Daswani', 'You may lead the way. I can protect myself, though.')
('Van', "Got'cha.")
('System', 'Van led Daswani to the location he had in mind.')
('Van', 'Well, we got it in the end.')
('Van', "Shame it ended up costing more than the retail price,<br/>but it beats not gettin' it at all.")
('Inspector Daswani', "True. It'd have costed me an arm and a leg were it not<br/>for your quick wit.")
('Van', "I think we owe it to that terrifying scowl on your face.<br/>He'd've never bought my story otherwise.")
('Inspector Daswani', 'You seriously need to work on your compliments.')
('Van', 'Anyway, you really are a strange one. I doubt anyone<br/>in the history of the Blacklight District has asked a<br/>question like that one.')
('Inspector Daswani', 'I was quite surprised at the answer I received.')
('Inspector Daswani', "'I don't even know how to live in the sun's light.'")
('Inspector Daswani', "When I first visited that district, I quickly realized the<br/>outside world's logic doesn't apply there.")
('Inspector Daswani', 'And I had that same feeling all over again.')
('Inspector Daswani', "Although, I understand now that thrusting our logic<br/>on its people isn't the way forward.")
('Inspector Daswani', "I probably shouldn't be saying this as an enforcer of<br/>the law...")
('Inspector Daswani', "...but while I can't say I understand their way of<br/>thinking—nor can I accept it as right...")
('Inspector Daswani', '...I can acknowledge that there may be things in this<br/>world that are neither black nor white.')
('Van', 'That so?')
('Van', "Well, it's time for this lawless ruffian to get out of<br/>your hair.")
('Van', 'I hope she likes her present.')
('Inspector Daswani', 'As do I. Although, the relief it provides will no doubt<br/>be momentary.')
('Inspector Daswani', "This isn't the first time I've made her sad—and it<br/>won't be the last time, either.")
('Van', "Damn. The pessimism is real. Did the depressing air<br/>in the Blacklight District get to you or somethin'?")
('Inspector Daswani', 'Quiet, you.')
('Van', "Let me leave you with this: you can think the world<br/>of someone, but if you don't put your feelings into<br/>action or words, they'll never know.")
('Van', "Deep down, though, I'm sure she already knows you<br/>really care about her.")
('Van', "You've just gotta keep tryin' to show it.")
('Inspector Daswani', '...')
('Van', "Well, I'm out.")
('Van', "Just treat me to a canned coffee sometime, and<br/>we're square.")
('Inspector Daswani', "*sigh* I just can't get a read on that guy...")
('Gigi', 'Daddy!')
('Inspector Daswani', 'Gigi...')
('Gigi', "I'm really sorry, Daddy.")
('Gigi', "I know how busy you are, and I shouldn't have been<br/>so mean to you...")
('Inspector Daswani', "I'm sorry, too—and to show I mean it, I got you a<br/>little special something.")
('System', 'Van quietly left the scene as if he had never been<br/>there at all.')
('System', 'And, with his work done, he returned to his patrol.')
('Ashen', "Hmm... I wonder what kind of gift he'd like?")
('Ashen', 'Remiferia is cold around this time of year, so maybe I<br/>should get him a pair of gloves. Or perhaps a scarf?')
('Van', 'Is this for your little brother?')
('Van', "He's studying in Remiferia right now, ain't he?")
('Ashen', "That's right. After all the trouble in Crossbell a year<br/>and a half ago, he decided to study abroad.")
('Ashen', "'I'm going to broaden my horizons,' were his words,<br/>as I recall. His experience over there must've<br/>been eye-opening.")
('Van', "Heh. Seems like you're proud of the kid.")
('Ashen', "I am...but he could stand to be less cheeky. And I<br/>wish he wouldn't fall head over heels for girls who<br/>are way out of his age range.")
('Van', "Lookin' to buy that for Gien?")
('Ashen', "Yeah. He's a bit of a soba addict. According to him,<br/>nothing beats it when you're tuckered out.")
('Ashen', "Sounds like he's been busy as a bee. He does a lot of<br/>advising these days.")
('Van', "Guess that screw up of his didn't shake his standing<br/>in Heiyue all that much.")
('Van', "I'd suggest buyin' the flour from Creil. Soba fans love<br/>that stuff, so if you give him that, he'll be in<br/>seventh heaven.")
('Ashen', "Oh, really now? Well, I think I'll trust your advice<br/>and go with that, then!")
('System', "Van's group decided to take a short break.")
('System', 'Everyone split up so they could spend their free time<br/>as they pleased.')
('Shaheena', 'Van! Over here!')
('Van', "Hey there. You're both lookin' well.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'Heehee. Same to you.')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "It's good to see you again.")
('Shaheena', "She means that, by the way. She's been REALLY<br/>desperate to meet up with you.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'Sh-Shaheena!')
('Van', "Hmm? Oh, yeah, I hear you've been asked to perform<br/>in Trion Tower.")
('Van', "You two are really movin' up in the world, ain'tcha?")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'I suppose. The tourism association here in Edith<br/>contacted our agency and requested we put on a<br/>show there.')
('Shaheena', 'It sounds like our performance in the Carnal<br/>Cavalcade made an impression on them.')
('Shaheena', 'And I bet they were also blown away by the show we<br/>did with Arc en Ciel in Crossbell!')
('Van', 'Speaking of which, I wanna hear about how that<br/>went, but first we gotta wait for the others to show—')
('Feri', 'Saara! Shaheena!')
('Agnès', 'Welcome to Edith!')
('Aaron', "What's up, you two?")
('Risette', "It's difficult to believe only a month has passed since<br/>we last met.")
('Shaheena', 'Whoa! Hey, everyone!')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'You all came to see us? Well, this is a<br/>pleasant surprise.')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "Oh? I don't believe we've met.")
('Quatre', "We haven't. Though everyone's told me quite a bit<br/>about you both. My name is—")
('System', 'Quatre introduced himself to them, and the whole<br/>group celebrated their reunion.')
('System', 'After that, they all made their way to Old Town.')
('Agnès', 'Okay, time for some shopping.')
('Agnès', 'This place sells just about everything you can think<br/>of—from luxury goods to daily necessities.')
('Agnès', "I believe there's a shop that sells guns on the second<br/>floor, too, but I've never visited it.")
('Van', "No surprise there. You can't even go inside without<br/>a permit.")
('Van', "That shop's called Thunders, by the way.<br/>That's where we're goin' next.")
('Van', "Feel free to wander around the other shops, though.<br/>We can pick up some medicine while we're here.")
('Agnès', "This is the orbal café. I've never seen a store like this<br/>anywhere else but here.")
('Van', "Me neither. It's a pretty novel concept. Come in, buy<br/>some orbments, and kick back and relax with some<br/>coffee or tea.")
('Van', "The owner's wise beyond his years.")
('Agnès', "He's a barista, too, isn't he?")
('Van', "Yeah. The guy's pretty quirky.")
('Van', "Anyway, we're only here to make use of the<br/>orbal factory.")
('Van', "Let's make our way over to the counter.")
('Agnès', 'All right.')
('System', 'The door is locked.')
('Van', "Oh, yeah. This area isn't finished yet. We'll have to<br/>come back when it is.")
('Van', "Probably not a good idea to go wanderin' off while<br/>lugging this case around.")
('Van', 'Before we do anything else, we need to drop it off<br/>at Riverside.')
('System', 'Enter the underground ruins?')
('System', 'Plugins can be set by selecting Set Plugin.')
