('Melchior', "You've REALLY gone and done it this time, you<br/>filthy spriggan trash.")
('Agnès', 'So this is the interior of Vashtar Palace.')
('Bergard', 'It must have been a sight to behold before the<br/>monarch was overthrown a century ago.')
('Feri', 'Almost time for our final battle.')
('Risette', 'Indeed. Though I am unsure of what to expect from<br/>the remaining Almata members.')
('Aaron', "I'll tell you what we can expect. They'll come at us,<br/>and we'll beat their asses to a bloody pulp.")
('Quatre', "And we'll stop them from detonating the bomb.")
('Judith', "Sounds like a plan. Let's get this party started!")
('Van', "Time to put the pedal to the metal and go after 'em—<br/>full speed ahead!")
('Arioch', 'Finally. You sure took your sweet-ass time.')
('Van', 'Arioch!')
('Feri', "I guess I should've expected to find him here.")
('Risette', 'I assume we must defeat you first before we get<br/>to Dantès?')
('Arioch', 'Heh. You got that right, pretty lady.')
('Arioch', "We couldn't really go at it in the labyrinth, but there's<br/>nothin' stopping us from fighting to the death now.")
('Arioch', "This place ain't got any of the resplendence it had<br/>when I came here in the bygone days...")
('Arioch', "...but this decrepit, old ruin makes for a kickass<br/>backdrop for our fight, don't ya think?")
('Agnès', 'Wait...')
('Judith', "What do you mean by 'when I came here in the<br/>bygone days'?")
('Bergard', 'I know the answer to that. There was a report on him<br/>from the East eight years ago—one that I had trouble<br/>believing at first.')
('Bergard', "You were born in a different era, weren't you?")
('Arioch', 'Oh, did I never mention that? Whoops.')
('Arioch', 'I was born a long time ago—before your grandparents<br/>were in diapers, in fact. Back in my day, the Holy<br/>Iskan Empire still stood firm.')
('Aaron', 'What?!')
('Quatre', 'Th-The Holy Iskan Empire? You mean the one that<br/>ruled over the entire eastern side of the continent?')
('Risette', 'As I recall, it fell about 130 years ago.')
('Agnès', "So he's over 130 years old? How is that possible?")
('Van', "Probably 'cause of the artifacts. I'm guessin' the<br/>halberd and armor are what's keepin' you alive, yeah?")
('Arioch', "Uh-huh. They're called the Fangs of Rahu, and<br/>they've been passed down in my old tribe<br/>for generations.")
('Arioch', "My people were from the West, and we all served the<br/>Iskan emperor. I once visited the Iskan Empire while<br/>escortin' a goodwill ambassador.")
('Arioch', 'Then the empire fell shortly after I returned home<br/>from that trip. Most of my tribe died with it.')
('Arioch', "'Cept me, of course. Thanks to these things, I'm still<br/>alive and kickin'.")
('Arioch', "After that, I spent my days wanderin' the desolate<br/>wastelands of the East.")
('Arioch', "Bandits and jaegers made a habit of pickin' fights<br/>with me, and I'd murder 'em all to quench the fangs'<br/>unquenchable thirst.")
('Arioch', 'That was the life I lived for over a century, but it all<br/>came to an abrupt end when the church set their<br/>sights on me.')
('Arioch', "They branded me a heretic and hunted me like a dog.<br/>Then one day, while I was busy fightin' off some of<br/>'em, a group of assassins came to help me out.")
('Arioch', "They'd only just started up at that point, and they<br/>were sniffin' around for new hires. They offered me a<br/>place among 'em.")
('Arioch', "And who was I to say no? I'd spent a hundred years in<br/>the wastelands, so bein' an overseer sounded like the<br/>sweetest deal in the world to me.")
('Arioch', 'Eventually, the Emperor kicked the bucket, which<br/>prompted Melchior to find us a sponsor.')
('Arioch', 'And, well, you know the rest of the story from there.')
('Feri', 'So the artifacts cursed you with eternal life...')
('Fie', "It's not unlike what happened with the Immortals,<br/>though the circumstances are different.")
('Cao', 'It reminds me of the Immortals of the Erebonian<br/>Empire, though the circumstances are<br/>rather different.')
('Shizuna', 'You were part of the Rahu tribe, one of the nine<br/>peoples of the Navagraha.')
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Reminds me a little of the Steel Maiden.')
('Bergard', "So you're the Invisible Tempest—the walking<br/>monstrosity who mercilessly slaughters his victims<br/>and leaves no witnesses to tell the tale.")
('Bergard', 'Even I had no idea that such an infamous heretic was<br/>leading one of the Gardens.')
('Aaron', 'You seem way more into working with Almata than<br/>the chick with the angel did.')
('Van', "Don't think you're enjoyin' it as much as Melchior,<br/>but it's easy to tell you're getting a real kick outta this.")
('Arioch', 'Haha. Course I am.')
('Arioch', "When I'm workin' with these guys, I just feel so alive.")
('Arioch', "But all good things gotta come to an end at some<br/>point, and this carnival's about to reach its climax.")
('Arioch', "All right, enough talk. I can't wait a minute longer, so<br/>let's get this show on the road.")
('Arioch', "I ain't gotta play the rules' enforcer anymore.<br/>I'm finally free to go all out!")
('Van', 'Tch!')
('Risette', "Be on your guard, everyone! He's unleashing the<br/>artifacts' full power!")
('Judith', '*sigh* Talk about disappointing.')
('Arioch', 'Come again?')
('Judith', "I had my expectations raised when you said you<br/>wanted me specifically to take part in this 'carnival'...")
('Judith', '...and those expectations were thoroughly dashed.<br/>Is this really the best entertainment you can offer?')
('Agnès', 'Judith...')
('Aaron', '...?')
('Arioch', 'Heheh. I love a woman with spunk.')
('Arioch', "You and I got some things in common. We're both<br/>thrill-seekers: you find yours from actin' and thievin',<br/>I get mine from chopping heads off bodies.")
('Arioch', "Also like you, I'm hard to please. Do you really think<br/>you can quench my ravenous thirst for a good fight?")
('Judith', "Yes, I do. I'm going to put on one hell of a show just<br/>for you.")
('Judith', "You should feel lucky. I'm going to give you my<br/>undivided attention—because I won't let a potential<br/>fan live a cursed and meaningless existence.")
('Arioch', '...!')
(40301, 'Consider this my calling card—from the Phantom<br/>Thief Grimcat to Arioch the Eradicator:')
(40301, "I'm going to bring you to your knees, and I'll steal<br/>your empty heart right before you!")
('Zin the Immovable', '*whistle*')
('Rixia', 'You go, Judith!')
('Van', 'Heh. Hell yeah.')
('Feri', 'You tell him, sister!')
('Shizuna', 'Haha. What an adorable little proclamation.')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'Heehee. Impressive.')
('Arioch', "Hahaha... AHAHAHA! You'll steal my heart?<br/>That's the funniest shit I've heard all week.")
('Arioch', "If you think you can fill the bottomless void<br/>deep within me, then you're welcome to try!")
('Arioch', 'Too easy!')
('Arioch', 'What?!')
('Van', 'Now!')
(40301, "It's...over!")
('Quatre', 'W-We did it!')
('Bergard', "Exceptional work. You managed to break the<br/>artifacts' core.")
('Arioch', 'Haha... That really WAS a hell of a show.')
(40301, "Well, of course! I did promise as much. And I even<br/>recreated Golden Blood's climax just for you.")
('Arioch', "Didn't see that coming at all.")
(40301, "Wh-What's going on?!")
('Agnès', 'W-Wait, is this...?')
('Feri', "It's just like what happened to Aida...")
('Arioch', "Haha... You are one captivatin' gal, you know that?<br/>It's like you were commandin' my attention in<br/>that fight...")
('Arioch', '...and in the movie I saw last night.')
('Judith', 'Wait, you went to the movies? Did you actually go to<br/>see Gold—')
('Arioch', "Victory is yours. You said you'd bring me to my<br/>knees, and you did just that.")
('Arioch', "The path to Dantès is open. He's all that<br/>remains now. Melchior will just be there as a witness.")
('Arioch', "Let's hope you can stand up to the boss' fear. Heheh.<br/>Or else your legs might give out from under you.")
('Judith', '...')
('Judith', "If you really did go to see it, you could've at least<br/>shared your impressions with me...")
('Rixia', 'Judith...')
('Aaron', "Guess that's one mystery that'll stay<br/>forever unsolved.")
('Agnès', 'But at the very least he seemed...satisfied as he<br/>passed, somehow.')
('Van', 'Yeah. Maybe you managed to fill some of that empty<br/>heart of his right at the end.')
('Judith', 'Heh. One can only hope.')
('Judith', "All right, I'm done stealing the spotlight. I'll hand<br/>over the reins to the rest of you.")
('Judith', "Oh, but I'm not planning on slacking off now. I may<br/>be a temp employee, but I'm still gonna give this<br/>my all!")
('Van', "Naturally. I expect nothin' less from all my<br/>employees—temp or perm.")
('Van', "The next fight'll be our last. Then this madness will<br/>finally be behind us.")
('Van', "Get ready, everyone. We're gonna go in there and<br/>make Dantès pay for all his crimes!")
('Agnès', 'Right! / Very well!')
('Dantès', 'Welcome to my humble abode.')
('Melchior', 'Ahaha! And here I was thinking that Arioch would<br/>wipe the floor with you, but you did that to him.')
('Van', "And we're gonna do the same to Dantès!")
('Feri', 'You better stay out of our way, Melchior!')
('Melchior', "Of course, of course. Just pretend like I'm invisible.")
('Melchior', "I will merely serve as an idle spectator. I wouldn't<br/>dream of spoiling the boss' big moment. ♪")
('Melchior', "Though I do wish I could join in on the fun. I'd love<br/>to grab the neck of that wretched vermin who called<br/>that airship—and give a nice, long squeeze.")
('Agnès', '...')
('Dantès', 'Heh. Worry not, Melchior.')
('Dantès', 'The passengers will have the distinct honor of<br/>witnessing their homes, families, and friends explode<br/>before their very eyes.')
('Dantès', 'All they can do is watch helplessly from above as their<br/>former lives go up in flames. I can hardly imagine a<br/>more perfect gift of fear.')
('Agnès', '...!')
('Aaron', 'You bastard...')
('Quatre', 'Does your wickedness know no bounds?')
('Van', "We didn't come here to chat the night away, asshole.<br/>We came here to beat the shit out of you.")
('Van', 'Are you just gonna sit on that dumbass throne and<br/>hurl cheap taunt after cheap taunt?')
('Dantès', 'No, no. We will hold our battle momentarily.')
('Dantès', 'And after the victor is determined, the final judgment<br/>will be passed.')
('Quatre', "There's the nuclear weapon.")
('Judith', "So that's what it looks like.")
('Dantès', 'It is still incomplete, so there is no need to fear—<br/>too much.')
('Dantès', 'It cannot be detonated. At least, not without this key.')
('Agnès', "That's the sword we saw in Dingo's video.")
('Feri', 'Just the sight of it is sending chills down my spine.')
('Bergard', "Not surprising. It is a deadly blade that's holy and<br/>demonic in nature. Its existence was a closely guarded<br/>secret of the royal family of Calvard.")
('Bergard', 'After the kingdom fell, the church attempted to<br/>recover it, but no trace of it was ever found.')
('Bergard', "So how in the Goddess' name did you come into<br/>possession of Apeiron, the Sword<br/>of Divine Darkness?")
('Risette', "So that is what it's called.")
('Aaron', "Wait, why're we only hearing about this now?!")
('Dantès', 'Heh. This sword has become something of a legend.<br/>I understand why you are shocked to see this in<br/>my hands.')
('Dantès', 'Allow me to enlighten you. This very blade was<br/>passed down to me. I had the right of its inheritance.')
('Dantès', 'I was born by the name of Gerard Eldarion. I am a<br/>descendant of the royalty that once ruled Calvard.')
('Dantès', 'Therefore, both it and the throne are rightfully mine.')
('Dantès', 'You must be curious as to how a descendant of the<br/>royal family still lives and stands before you.')
('Dantès', 'That is because I was taken into the care of a cult that<br/>is now extinct.')
('Van', '...!')
('Quatre', '...!')
('Feri', 'The D∴G cult...')
('Risette', 'They were one of the groups that went on to become<br/>the Gardens after spreading chaos across<br/>the Republic.')
('Melchior', "Oh, boy! The Oathbreaker must've spilled the tea<br/>on that. Yes, the Gardens can trace its roots back to<br/>the cult...")
('Melchior', '...as well as the Order of the Moonlight Horse, which<br/>he and I once belonged to.')
('Melchior', 'Then he ran off to the society with your friend the<br/>Golden Butterfly and another ex-member, leaving<br/>seven-year-old me in the dust all the while.')
('Walter the Direwolf', "Wow, that's some ancient history there. That was,<br/>what, three years before I signed up with 'em?")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'Oh, that certainly takes me back. I did feel a tinge of<br/>guilt for abandoning you at that tender age. I tried to<br/>find somewhere for you to start anew.')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "But when I saw how much fun you were having in<br/>your new playground, I realized that wasn't necessary.")
('Melchior', 'And right you were! Imagine receiving an open<br/>invitation to create your very own garden of killers!<br/>Oh, I was drowning in a sea of blissful ecstasy!')
('Melchior', 'Even you had to be impressed with how it all<br/>came together.')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'Ohh, yes. Very impressed. You certainly put your<br/>skinny back into the task.')
('Melchior', 'Ahaha! I worked my pretty little self to the bone!')
('Melchior', 'Then he ran off to the society with the Golden<br/>Butterfly and another ex-member, leaving<br/>seven-year-old me in the dust all the while.')
('Melchior', 'But he did tell me I could make my very own garden<br/>of killers, and oh, did I very much enjoy doing so.')
('Melchior', 'As a result of my efforts, I met the Emperor, herded<br/>the remnants of the cult, became acquainted with<br/>Arioch and Olympia...')
('Melchior', '...and, most important of all, found our wonderful<br/>boss shortly after he assumed control of Almata.')
('Melchior', 'I met a descendant of Calvardian royalty and a former<br/>high priest of the D∴G cult! How could I perceive it<br/>as anything but a fortuitous twist of fate?')
('Judith', 'So what exactly are you all trying to accomplish here?')
('Agnès', "Are you attempting to restore the<br/>Republic's monarchy? Or are you following in the<br/>footsteps of the cult?")
('Dantès', 'Hmph. Neither.')
('Dantès', "I care nothing for the country's revolution one<br/>hundred years ago, nor do I care about the increasing<br/>number of immigrants welcomed through its doors.")
('Dantès', 'And I will not leech off the teachings of the cult like<br/>a parasite—as my parents once did.')
('Dantès', "I'm afraid those things bring me no<br/>fulfillment whatsoever.")
('Dantès', 'I am not the kind of man who obsesses over past<br/>glories, nor do I desire to rebel against the Goddess.')
('Dantès', 'Everything that drives a human being to action—<br/>friendship, work, envy, love...')
('Dantès', '...all of it holds no meaning—just an endless source of<br/>frivolity and tedium. So I sought a diversion—a<br/>reprieve from this vapid world.')
('Dantès', 'And I found just the answer I was looking for.<br/>The ultimate source of reprieve: fear.')
('Van', '...')
('Dantès', 'You cannot deny that our neighbors in the Erebonian<br/>Empire prospered greatly as a result of conflict.')
('Dantès', 'And much like conflict, fear is a fundamental<br/>component of human nature.')
('Dantès', 'Life, death, order, and chaos can only exist because<br/>of fear. It is at the heart of everything—the<br/>foundation upon which all else exists.')
('Dantès', 'Once I learned that, I began my lifelong pursuit: to<br/>seek out fear in its purest form and instill it<br/>in everyone.')
('Aaron', "You're one sick piece of shit, you know that?")
('Quatre', "So that's why you were drawn to the concept of<br/>nuclear weapons...and you got Professor Callaghan<br/>wrapped up in your web of lies!")
('Dantès', 'Indeed. And he created a wondrous work of art.')
('Dantès', "But alas. It just isn't good enough on its own.")
('Dantès', "As a weapon, it's too unstable, and it won't leave a<br/>permanent mark on the world—even if we were to<br/>take the lives of everyone in this city.")
('Dantès', 'People will be dismayed for a time, but like with<br/>the Salt Pale and Retributive Tower incidents,<br/>they will forget and move on.')
('Dantès', 'And that is what led me to the idea of this carnival.')
('Dantès', 'It is the birthplace for the ultimate fear—one that will<br/>fester inside every human being for the rest of<br/>their lives.')
('Dantès', 'Now, I grow weary of idle chatter. Shall we begin our<br/>duel to the death?')
('Judith', 'Sounds good to me. You are SO going down!')
('Feri', "This'll be tough, but we can't afford to lose!")
('Bergard', "We also can't afford to be reckless. I'm almost certain<br/>he is up to something.")
('Zin the Immovable', "Well, regardless, we've gotta pull out all the stops if<br/>we wanna beat this guy!")
('Rixia', 'Be that as it may, we will have to come at him with<br/>everything we have if we hope to win!')
('Shizuna', "True. But we've still gotta pull out all the stops<br/>against him, or we're done for.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Probably. Still, we've gotta go for broke, otherwise<br/>he'll make mincemeat out of us.")
('Van', "Yeah, I know. That's why I'm goin' full throttle from<br/>the get-go.")
('Van', 'Mare!')
('Mare', "Heehee! Maaare to the rescue! Okay, Van.<br/>Hope you're ready to...")
('Van', '...Hmm? Uh, yeah. Ready to go!')
('Mare', "Umm... O-Okay. Shard swell... The Grendel's<br/>all yours!")
('Van', '(...?)')
('Dantès', 'Heh. Ah, there it is. I was wondering if you would<br/>pull the same trick again.')
('Dantès', 'So that must be your nightmare, then?')
('Van/Grendel', '...Wh-What just—?!')
('Mare', 'Aaaaargh!')
('Agnès', 'M-Mare!')
('Risette', "Something's interfering with her AI!")
('Van/Grendel', 'Mare-Bear! Snap out of it!')
('Mare', 'No... This is all wrong...')
('Mare', "This isn't who I am! This isn't me!")
('Feri', '...?!')
('Quatre', 'Sh-She vanished...')
('Van/Grendel', 'The hell did you do to her?!')
('Dantès', "Heh. What's wrong? You still have your restraints, do<br/>you not?")
('Dantès', 'You should focus less on her and more on the battle<br/>at hand.')
('Dantès', 'I wonder how this will play out. Will I fall prey to<br/>your nightmare? Or will you be consumed by my fear?')
('Aaron', 'Urgh!')
('Feri', "Let's go!")
('Van/Grendel', 'Rgh... OHHHHHHHH!')
('Dantès', 'Hahaha! Is that all your precious nightmare can do?<br/>How pathetic.')
('Dantès', 'Surveillance system! Adjust parameters!')
('Dantès', "Set the game's end time to exactly three minutes<br/>from now! Once the timer hits zero, throw Apeiron<br/>and I against the bomb!")
('Agnès', 'Oh, no!')
('Bergard', 'Not good!')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Ugh. What a dirty trick!')
('Cao', 'How cunning.')
('Shizuna', "Didn't see that coming!")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'You are a little devil.')
('Agnès', 'Van!')
('Feri', 'A-Are you all right?!')
('Risette', "I-I'll see to you right away!")
('Van', "*pant* *pant* Don't worry. My injuries aren't<br/>that bad.")
('Van', "Nothin' like what he has. Didn't really have much of<br/>a choice at the end there...")
('Quatre', "Of course you didn't!")
('Aaron', 'That was self-defense, pure and simple. Son of a<br/>bitch practically held a gun to our heads.')
('Judith', "Yeah. If you didn't do that, he would have killed us<br/>and all of the people in Oración.")
('Van', 'The final boss Dantès has been defeated. Zone clear.')
('Van', 'Congratulations, Team Arkride Solutions. You have<br/>won the game.')
('Feri', '...')
('Quatre', "Don't worry. It'll take more than a little fall to<br/>detonate it.")
('Judith', "So, it's finally over, right?")
('Bergard', 'I believe so. The game at least is fini—')
('Melchior', "That's right. This marks the end of the greatest party<br/>in history.")
('Melchior', 'Ahh... Even in death, you shine so beautifully,<br/>boss. You died with the grace of an angel.')
('Melchior', 'But you were also as selfish as a devil till your<br/>dying breath. How could you walk the road to hell by<br/>yourself and leave me to wallow in misery?')
('Melchior', "Though I suppose that's part of why I fell for you in<br/>the first place.")
('Aaron', "You're free to join him anytime, bud.")
('Van', "The jig is up, Melchior. We beat your stupid game,<br/>and your organization is toast. Why don't you<br/>surrender and come quietly?")
('Bergard', 'That sword only answers to those it deems worthy.<br/>You will not be able to use it to detonate the bomb.')
('Melchior', 'Of course. That was never in the cards.')
('Melchior', 'But I figure I can whip up a nice little fireworks<br/>show—to commemorate the life of my dear boss.')
('Agnès', 'Aaah!')
('Risette', 'Explosive artifacts?!')
('Melchior', 'Heh. I scattered them all throughout the palace<br/>juuust in case it all shook out like this.')
('Melchior', 'If you wish to make it out alive, you better<br/>get moving! I hope to see you alive and well at our<br/>next meeting. Adieu!')
('Aaron', 'Damn it!')
('Judith', "W-We've got to book it. Let's go!")
('Van', 'Ugh... We gotta grab the Genesis and the bomb!')
('Agnès', 'Right!')
('Bergard', 'You can leave that to me!')
('Quatre', 'Th-Thank you!')
('Risette', "*gasp* It's Arioch's armor!")
('Aaron', "But there isn't anyone inside!")
('Bergard', 'The Fangs of Rahu has a mind of its own. It craves<br/>fresh sacrifices, and it will get what it desires—master<br/>or no master.')
('Judith', "Wh-What?! You're pulling my leg, right?!")
('Feri', "I-It's not going to let us past, is it?")
('Van', "Bah. We REALLY don't got time for this shit<br/>right now!")
('Dominion Celis', "Then we'll deal with it for you!")
('Agnès', 'Oh!')
('Bergard', 'Impeccable timing, you two!')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'We came as soon as we heard the game was over.')
('Dominion Celis', "Collectin' artifacts is kind of our thing, so you can<br/>leave this to us.")
('Agnès', 'W-Wait! But this place is about to collapse!')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "Don't worry. We have an escape route already<br/>laid out.")
('Bergard', "You have our thanks, but don't dawdle in this place<br/>for long.")
('Dominion Celis', 'Not another step!')
('Dominion Celis', "It's payback time, Fangs of Rahu! Let's do this, Leon!")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'Right!')
('Dominion Celis', 'Searing seal of mine, shining from the abyss...')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'Glacial seal of mine, shining from the abyss...')
('Feri', "That's where we came in from!")
('Quatre', 'How do we get out now?')
('Van', 'Over there!')
('Risette', "There's fire here, too!")
('Judith', "Ugh! Where's a convenient exit when you need it?!")
('Van', "This way'll do! It leads to the watchtower on the<br/>castle walls!")
('Van', 'All right, you guys. Get ready to jump!')
('Agnès', 'Jump?!')
('Aaron', "What?! You're insane!")
('Quatre', 'Oh, nooooooooo!')
('Dantès', 'You dare mock me?!')
('Dantès', 'Gah!')
('Van', '...?!')
('Dantès', 'Haha. I was right all along...')
('Dantès', 'I found it... Seems my work here is now done...')
('System', 'The elevator has seemingly been disabled.')
