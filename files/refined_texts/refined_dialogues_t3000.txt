('Banker Oliver', "Feels like he's scared of losing the government's<br/>favor—and all of his corporate partnerships with it.")
('Banker Oliver', "Bearing all that in mind, I can see why he's just<br/>staying the course here. Don't rock the boat, and all.")

('Risette', "(Though in Tharbad, actually... No, perhaps I<br/>shouldn't broach that topic.)")
('Julian', "All right, I think that's all the broken glass<br/>swapped out. The storefronts should be fine now.")
('Julian', "I'm just trying to do what I can. Where I was raised,<br/>you were expected to pitch in to help the community<br/>in crises like these.")
('Julian', 'Okay... What else needs to be done?')
('Julian', "Sounds like Lyle's tuckered himself out. I'll go cover<br/>for him.")
('Julian', "I'm not too familiar with Verne weapons, myself...")
('Julian', "Hmm... Interesting. I've swung some Erebonian<br/>makes, and compared to those, these are much lighter<br/>and easier to carry.")
('Julian', "They just take out some of the bulk in exchange.<br/>I don't imagine they have stuff like the two-handers<br/>my grandfather used... Bit of a shame.")
('Aaron', '(Huh. Kid knows his stuff. Not every day you meet a<br/>two-hander specialist.)')
('Agnès', '(From what I heard, Julian hails from a line of<br/>renowned Erebonian swordsmen.)')
('Van', "(Certainly looks the part. There's somethin'...strange<br/>about him, though. Can't put my finger on it.)")
('Julian', 'Incidentally, Renne made for the Artisanal<br/>District, right?')
('Julian', "Maybe she's thinking to buy Tita a souvenir<br/>or something...")
('Julian', 'I feel like I owe her one as well. She was a huge help<br/>last year.')
('Agnès', "(Tita? That name rings a bell, but I can't place it...)")
('Van', '(Hmm...)')
('Julian', 'Back when I was in school in the Empire, I had this<br/>amazing group of upperclassmen who helped me with<br/>my studies.')
('Julian', "They've already gone and graduated, but not before<br/>sharing some of their secrets on how to<br/>talk 'romance.' Or something along those lines.")
('Julian', 'This trip is an excellent opportunity to broaden<br/>our horizons. Little point in being shy!')
('Julian', 'The pharmacy over there had quite the mix of stuff,<br/>almost like a convenience store.')
('Julian', 'You had your medicine there, but then groceries and<br/>other goods, too.')
('Julian', "They're even open all day, according to the sign.")
('Julian', "Guess there's something to be said for having<br/>whatever you need, whenever you need it.")
('Julian', 'We first-years decided to take a little unguided tour of<br/>the city.')
('Julian', "We've been to Roer, which is where Reinford's<br/>headquartered, and we thought that place was<br/>high-tech, but boy...")
('Julian', "Basel is just in a whole other league. It's got so much<br/>stuff going on—they have these huge facilities and<br/>experiments, all within city limits.")
('Julian', 'I hardly know where to look first. I wanna take in as<br/>much of this place as I can.')
('Lyle', '*huff* Phew... I just tagged along with Julian...<br/>*huff* To try and help, but...')
('Lyle', "...what are those things, solid metal?! *huff* They're<br/>so damn heavy!")
('Lyle', "And there he is, just pickin' 'em up and haulin' 'em<br/>out, over and over again like they're nothing...")
('Lyle', "I was just thinking about how Julian got so popular,<br/>and I think that there's my answer. He ain't just a<br/>pretty face... Geez.")
('Lyle', "Thought I might learn his secret by taggin' up with<br/>him on this...")
('Lyle', "...but man. He's got the brains AND the brawn.<br/>And a total lady-killer face, too!")
('Lyle', "So like, Chignon won't move a rege.")
('Lyle', "Julian went to go check out the weapons shop, and he<br/>hasn't come back.")
('Lyle', "Is it just me, or am I the only one actually trying to<br/>study stuff here? Agnès, what's your take?")
('Agnès', "Er, well, who's to say?")
('Lyle', "Julian was telling me that honesty is what girls like.<br/>That you gotta be yourself, y'know?")
('Lyle', "That makes a lotta sense—from this day forward, I'm<br/>gonna be the most honest guy you've ever seen!")
('Lyle', 'Julian! Help a brother out!')
('Julian', 'All right, all right, haha... The first step is<br/>trust, generally. Women like sincerity in a man.')
('Lyle', "Man, these new orbal goodies are where it's at!")
('Lyle', "This place really lives up to its name. You've got some<br/>cutting-edge tech on display here!")
('Lyle', '...Not that I could afford any of this with my<br/>part-time pay. Ugh...')
('Chignon', 'Er, Lyle, you might not wanna say that out loud.')
('Lyle', "C'mon, c'mon, we gotta get going! There's so much<br/>to see!")
('Lyle', "The motor pavilion's a hot spot, but I really wanna<br/>check out those official Verne shops, too!")
('Lyle', "Imagine gettin' my hands on one of those<br/>new stereos... They'd be a total chick magnet<br/>back home!")
('James', 'Tch... Was gonna bounce, but this old fart had to trip<br/>and fall in front of me.')
('James', "...Wasn't nothin'. Don't need no thanks, I don't<br/>wanna stick around here any longer.")
('Agnès', '(James has always been a bit rough around the edges,<br/>but, well...)')
('Van', "(Guess he's got his reasons for actin' like a jerkoff.)")
('Van', "(But y'know, he's got a good side to him. He shows a<br/>little bit of that sometimes.)")
('Van', '(At any rate, none of my business.)')
('Van', "(He strikes me as the bluffin' type. It's all an act.)")
('James', "Puzzle game, huh? Feel like they're just toyin'<br/>with me...")
('James', "...but eh. Guess it wasn't the worst way to kill<br/>some time.")
('James', 'Ahem! Might as well hit the sack early tonight.')
('James', "'From the engineer, a pair of ZCF goggles will spell<br/>your way'?")
('James', '...What do ZCF goggles have to do with anything?<br/>I hate stupid scavenger hunts like these.')
('James', 'Hmph. Not bad.')
('James', "Whenever I see one of those fancy ETWS models, I<br/>can't help but think of him...")
('James', "Ugh... I knew this'd be boring...")
('James', "But no, they had to just drag me here, anyway.<br/>Freakin' Student Council president...")
('James', "Grrgh. Just thinkin' about it's gettin' me pissed.")
('Agnès', '(I wonder what Renne said to him...?)')
('James', "Sasha's annoying, as usual. Can't gimme some peace<br/>and quiet...")
('James', 'And why the hell do I gotta babysit the freshmen?')
('Elderly Woman', 'Oh, thank you so much, young man!')
('Elderly Woman', "Hmm... Ohh, is your uniform from that big school in<br/>the capital? My, you're just an upstanding young man!")
('James', "Wha...?! No, that ain't nothin'!")
('James', "I just...happened to be here. Tch. You're embarrassin'<br/>me, geezer.")
('Elderly Woman', 'Oh, thank you ever so much. I just had to go out and<br/>get my groceries, in spite of everything going on...')
('James', "Just, watch your stinkin' feet, okay? There's still<br/>rubble everywhere.")
('Elderly Woman', "Oh, dear. You're right... I could use a hand. Can you<br/>help me, young man?")
('James', 'Wha—?! H-Hell no, I—!')
('Sasha', "Renne left me in charge here. I'm trying to coordinate<br/>all the students so that we can get everything<br/>sorted out.")
('Sasha', "The student council's helping me out, which is a<br/>big help...")
('Sasha', "...but I'm still nervous. There's a lot of time before<br/>that special unit gets here in the evening...<br/>Anything could happen before then.")
('Sasha', 'I just need to make sure the students are all safe and<br/>accounted for.')
('Sasha', "I'm trying to keep all the students inside, but I've had<br/>to make a couple exceptions so far.")
('Sasha', 'Julian and Lyle volunteered to help with the cleanup<br/>out there, so I let them outside...')
('Sasha', "...but then James snuck out again. Goddess, he's just<br/>such a handful.")
('Sasha', "Well, I'll keep my eye out for him, and whatever else<br/>comes up. You guys be careful, too!")
('Sasha', "So what've we got? Today's reflections,<br/>tomorrow's plans... Lots of stuff to keep track of.")
('Sasha', 'We sophomores have our big research papers<br/>due, too.')
('Sasha', 'Wait, what about James? Oh, damn it, did he sneak<br/>out again?')
('Sasha', "Renne seems to have caught wind of that... I'll leave<br/>him to her.")
('Sasha', 'I believe it was back in the spring when she, well...did<br/>what she did.')
('Sasha', "Though in his defense, James wasn't at fault. It was<br/>his partner in crime, Ronald—and he got crushed<br/>for it. Like, I'm talkin' FLATTENED.")
('Sasha', "Ever since then, wouldn't you know it, she's been<br/>super popular!")
('Sasha', "James has his own recollection of things, I'm sure.<br/>He has a bit of a...cloudy disposition.")
('Sasha', 'If you need to tell the big four apart, look no further<br/>than their management strategies...')
('Sasha', "(James looks like he's...having fun? Wack.)")
('Sasha', '(I hope he finds a way to move on from all that...)')
('Sasha', "Okay, everyone's here! Let's get this show on<br/>the road!")
('Sasha', 'Given who we have, the motor pavilion would be a<br/>good place to hit up first.')
('Sasha', 'I need to work together with Renne to make sure this<br/>trip is a success!')
('Guide Finse', "We're still open here, thankfully—the damage wasn't<br/>bad enough to make us close.")
('Guide Finse', "But business is awfully slow today...and I can't<br/>blame people. Everybody's out there trying to pick up<br/>the pieces...literally.")
('Guide Finse', "That said, if you need anything, we're open<br/>and ready.")
('Guide Finse', "Our lights started flickering this morning, and I'm<br/>not sure why...")
('Guide Finse', "Surely the lamps aren't all going bad at once?<br/>We check them regularly.")
('Guide Finse', "Hmm... I'll have to lodge a ticket with the<br/>utility people.")
('Guide Finse', "There's always something going on here at<br/>the pavilion.")
('Guide Finse', 'We do industry press conferences, Z1 photoshoots,<br/>and even RC tournaments for kids.')
('Guide Finse', "We make sure there's something for everyone here, so<br/>take a look around and take a load off. We hope to<br/>see you again!")
('Guide Finse', "Welcome to the Basel Motor Pavilion. We've got the<br/>latest and greatest models from the big four<br/>on display. Do take a look!")
('Guide Finse', "We've opened up displays for all the new models they<br/>unveiled this autumn.")
('Guide Finse', "It's gotten us a lot of attention from gearheads the<br/>country over.")
('Guide Finse', "Of course, we've got models you can order today, too.<br/>Take a look around and see if there's anything<br/>you like.")
('Chamberlain', "Ingert's factory got hit, too, but they produce military<br/>vehicles over there, so the cars themselves were<br/>mostly fine.")
('Chamberlain', "We have a good deal of spare parts in stock here, so<br/>we're gonna try and help supply the other companies<br/>with whatever they need.")
('Chamberlain', "That's what the vice manager said, and I'm happy to<br/>stick to that.")
('Chamberlain', "We've got our own problems to iron out, though.<br/>Our communications network got thrown out of<br/>whack here...")
('Chamberlain', 'I have a friend who works for a factory on the<br/>outskirts of town. Turns out their comms are all<br/>messed up, too.')
('Chamberlain', "I knew a lot of places got damaged, but I wasn't<br/>expecting that they'd get through to all the big<br/>factories and facilities, too...")
('Chamberlain', 'The factories and the pavilion are constantly having<br/>their instruments checked...')
('Chamberlain', "Petra's been putting a lot of thought into remodeling<br/>Leno's brand image. She's trying to get more<br/>mass-market appeal.")
('Chamberlain', 'I could stand to learn a lot from her marketing tactics.<br/>She really knows how to get products out there.')
('Chamberlain', "Ingert has its customer base, but we're looking to<br/>broaden our reach, too, where we can.")
('Chamberlain', "What can I do you for? You interested in a...<br/>Ohh, hold on. I see that glint in your eye. You're a<br/>fan, aren't you?")
('Van', "Good catch! My pickup's my baby—actually took it<br/>out here with me!")
('Chamberlain', "'Eyy, a man of culture! I can tell by that look in your<br/>eyes that you know quality when you see it.")
('Chamberlain', "We pride ourselves on how modular our cars are.<br/>They're strong, they're durable, and you can<br/>customize 'em however you want!")
('Chamberlain', 'I saw you walk in and your eyes just jumped right to<br/>the suspension and cooling—I know those are<br/>popular mods on our models.')
('Chamberlain', "You're an avid aftermarket shopper yourself, if I had<br/>to guess. You know exactly where to look.")
('Van', "Oh, yeah. Guilty as charged. But y'know, it takes that<br/>same kinda mindset to KNOW people like doin' that.")
('Van', "So somethin' tells me you're a gearhead yourself.<br/>Am I right?")
('Chamberlain', 'Haha... You got me. I probably spend like half my<br/>bonuses on aftermarket mods.')
('Chamberlain', "I've got some photos of my new project here, you<br/>wanna take a look?")
('Van', "Oh, I'd just be honored. What kinda pimped-out ride<br/>does an honest-to-Goddess Ingert engineer come<br/>up with?")
('Aaron', "...NOW who's slacking off on the job?")
('Chamberlain', 'Part of what makes this job so satisfying is meeting<br/>customers and getting their feedback on our products.')
('Chamberlain', 'We really hammer in how utilitarian and<br/>customizable our cars are, and that gets us a more<br/>specific customer demographic compared to Leno.')
('Chamberlain', "So when I talk to a customer about our models and<br/>aftermarket mods, we really see eye to eye a lot.<br/>It's like making a friend!")
('Petra', "How's about a drink tonight, Chamberlain? It's been<br/>a while since we hit the town together.")
('Petra', 'I figure we both deserve it—we both got put through<br/>the wringer, but we went and hit our sales<br/>quotas anyway!')
('Chamberlain', "I might take you up on that. I could use a break to<br/>unwind after how hectic it's been lately.")
('Chamberlain', 'I do have some business stuff I wanted to talk to you<br/>about, though—like cost-cutting tactics and those<br/>new safety regs, namely.')
('Chamberlain', "I personally want to try and broaden Ingert's customer<br/>base, too. Maybe you could teach me a thing or two?")
('Petra', "Well, I wouldn't mind that...just as long as it doesn't<br/>get in the way of my frothy mugs.")
('Petra', "Competitors we may be, but we're fellow<br/>four-wheelers first and foremost!")
('Chamberlain', "Seriously...? They wrecked the Leno factory's whole<br/>assembly line?")
('Petra', "They did... There's no timetable for when we'll have<br/>everything back up and running.")
('Petra', "We can't order anything right now, anyway, because<br/>our suppliers got hit, too. It's looking like we'll be out<br/>of commission for a while...")
('Chamberlain', 'Hmm... You know, I recall you guys were still using<br/>last-gen manufacturing tools over there, right?')
('Chamberlain', 'Our Factory 3 might have some of those old tools<br/>lying around—we retrofitted the place with<br/>newer parts.')
('Chamberlain', 'The vice manager and I go way back, so I might be<br/>able to call in a favor and get that stuff transferred<br/>to Leno.')
('Petra', "It was built to Verne's specifications, if I recall, but it<br/>should work on a Leno assembly line with<br/>some tweaking.")
('Petra', "You'd really do that for us?")
('Chamberlain', "Of course. We're friends first and business<br/>rivals second. At the end of the day, we have the same<br/>passion for automotive engineering.")
('Chamberlain', "I'll shoot him a message. Can you get me a list of your<br/>damaged equipment at some point?")
('Petra', "Man, I knew Chamberlain had connections, but I<br/>never thought he'd go that far out of his way for us...")
('Petra', "Well, I'd better hold up my end of the plan. I'll get in<br/>touch with Factory 2.")
('Petra', "It's times like these when we gotta put our differences<br/>aside and work as a team!")
('Petra', "I'm hearing that the factory on the outskirts of town<br/>has been having power and comms trouble, too...")
('Petra', "They're manufacturing our new model—it's supposed<br/>to go on sale in the spring. I hope they get that<br/>resolved soon...and that it doesn't spread.")
('Petra', "Having someone like Chamberlain in charge at Ingert<br/>really lights a fire under me. It's like having a good<br/>rival, y'know?")
('Petra', 'We push each other to grow and develop bigger,<br/>better stuff—in the end, we both benefit!')
('Petra', "We're seeing that firsthand with Leno's success. I and<br/>the company as a whole grow and improve every day!")
('Petra', 'Welcome to the Leno exhibition space! This is our<br/>flagship model here.')
('Petra', "We worked hard on the interior for this revision to<br/>try and court older drivers. It's much more<br/>comfortable inside than before!")
('Aaron', "Leno's the everyman's car, yeah? I see them all over<br/>the place nowadays.")
('Aaron', "When I was taking driver's ed, they stuffed me in a<br/>Leno made for newbies.")
('Risette', 'Leno specializes in safety and economy, rather than<br/>power or carrying capacity.')
('Risette', "Per their slogan, they manufacture 'cars everyone can<br/>count on'.")
('Petra', "That's the common perception, yeah. We're a big hit<br/>with families and people who need daily drivers.")
('Petra', "But that's not all we do! We make RC cars,<br/>off-roaders, and we field entries on the Z1<br/>circuit, too.")
('Petra', "We're careful not to pigeonhole ourselves into any<br/>one niche. We're growing and evolving every day.")
('Petra', "That's what we're all about: we make cars you can<br/>count on, no matter what it is you do.")
('Petra', 'We really pride ourselves on that mass appeal: our<br/>cars have been adopted by just about every class<br/>and demographic.')
('Petra', "They're plenty safe and a cinch to drive, making them<br/>popular with all different kinds of people.")
('Junifer', 'I actually got some money from that Kaela lady after<br/>what happened.')
('Junifer', "I told her I didn't need it, but she insisted.<br/>She wanted to thank me for the help.")
('Junifer', "So what do I spend it on? Maybe I'll get me<br/>some souvenirs...")
('Junifer', "This... This isn't really happening, is it?")
('Junifer', 'N-No, snap out of it! I have to do something!<br/>My Kabul got cut up from all the shrapnel!')
('Junifer', "It's up to me now. No excuses!")
('Junifer', 'My uncle wanted me to run some errands for him in<br/>exchange for covering my travel costs.')
('Junifer', "Get this: one of his old friends is a factory manager!<br/>And I get to meet him! You think I'll get to watch<br/>him work, too?!")
('Junifer', "I'll have to ask my uncle! Surely he can pull some<br/>strings for his super cute niece?!")
('Junifer', "My uncle was an Ingert engineer, so I'm a big Ingert<br/>fangirl, too!")
('Junifer', "I drive a Leno, though. It's what I can afford!")
('Junifer', "I really wanna get a sports car, though. Once I<br/>scrounge up enough mira... Gah, I just can't wait!")
('Agnès', 'Oh...!')
('Van', "Oh, hey, you two. Didn't know you were comin'<br/>out here.")
('Junifer', "We're planning a big drive, so we figured why not?")
('Graham', 'We wanted to check out those new models<br/>from autumn... Man, these things rock!')
('Graham', "Cosmetically, it doesn't look much different from my<br/>old model, but the suspension here is...")
('Junifer', "Man, this thing's gonna fly right through the corners!<br/>That's Ingert for you—they know how to get the best<br/>outta their parts!")
('Van', "And are those new tire compounds, too? Haven't seen<br/>these before. Hah, they're always lookin' for ways<br/>to improve!")
('Aaron', "As if he weren't enough of a kid in a candy store...<br/>Not knocking it, though.")
('Feri', "(Aaron looks like he's having fun, too.)")
('Risette', '(This pavilion does seem to draw like-minded fans.)')
('Junifer', 'Oooh, this is that new ETWS model... Man, that<br/>price, though!')
('Graham', "That thing's a monster. Bet you the High Bloods<br/>have one of those.")
('Junifer', "Grr! How DARE they one-up Ingert! I-I mean, it's<br/>not like I'm jealous!")
('Graham', 'That was really nice—got to see the Z1 exhibit<br/>and everything. Probably best we head on home, now.')
('Junifer', "Yeah, I'm fresh out of travel money now. I really owe<br/>my uncle for that.")
('Junifer', "Oh, wait, that reminds me! He told me to say hello to<br/>a friend of his at the factory! He said he's a<br/>manager there!")
('Graham', "Hah, go figure he's got friends in high places.<br/>Sure, why not?")
('Graham', "I know it's kinda just an errand, but man, the thought<br/>of meeting a factory manager has me psyched!")
('Junifer', "Right? I'm gonna ask if we can watch him work!")
('Junifer', 'Whew... Yesterday was just wild.')
('Junifer', "We were coming home from the Ingert factory,<br/>and wham! That's when the attack broke out!")
('Graham', 'We made a beeline for the car and booked it outta<br/>there—like an action movie, I swear!')
('Graham', "But now we're stuck here. They've closed down the<br/>road back to the capital, so...now what?")
('Junifer', "And they're saying the Ingert factory was<br/>damaged, too...")
('Junifer', "...Y'know, maybe we can pitch in and help out<br/>over there?")
('Graham', "Not a bad idea! That's our chance to pay it forward to<br/>our favorite brand!")
('Graham', "I was awfully rattled there...but I'm glad we managed<br/>to help.")
('Graham', "But I still feel really on edge... The city's on<br/>lockdown, cops are crawling all over the streets...<br/>It just doesn't feel safe anymore.")
('Graham', "Just promise me you guys won't do anything crazy like<br/>before, got it? Goddess forbid you get caught up in<br/>another attack.")
('Graham', "My car was made in Basel, so it's...really<br/>disheartening to see what's going on here.")
('Graham', "But, well, if we're stuck here because of the road<br/>closures, then we might as well make ourselves useful<br/>while we're here!")
('Graham', "I've been seeing a bunch of cops around here since<br/>this morning. Way more than usual.")
('Graham', "Did something happen? We'd better be careful, just<br/>in case.")
('Graham', 'I saved a bit of money by buying the last-gen model,<br/>but I still had to take out a ten-year loan...')
('Graham', "Worth it, though! There's nothing like having your<br/>very own speed machine!")
('Graham', "So I can't go cheating on my baby with some<br/>shinier model. I gotta break her in first!")
('Dick', 'Urgh... I thought everybody else was modding their<br/>cars, but nope. It was just me all along...')
('Dick', "I mean, just... How the heck does Millia drive her car<br/>like that with no mods at all?! It doesn't make sense!")
('Dick', 'So those guys at the pavilion were actually real<br/>car racers!')
('Dick', 'I heard them talking about how they came from the<br/>capital and stuff.')
('Dick', 'Man, I wish I could go there and race the real<br/>thing, too. I wanna grow up, already!')
('Dick', "They said they didn't know if there'd be an RC<br/>tournament this month... Man, and I was so ready to<br/>beat Millia this time, too!")
('Dick', "Well, if there's no tourney, then I'll make my own<br/>or something! I wanna challenge her again, and<br/>THIS time, I'm gonna win!")
('Dick', "Man, there's just something about cars. Having all<br/>that power at your fingertips, feeling the wind rushing<br/>by...!")
('Dick', "RC cars are cool and all, but once I'm old enough to<br/>get my license, I wanna take a real car out for a spin!")
('Receptionist Trity', "At the moment, we're assessing damages to Verne<br/>Company and affiliates.")
('Receptionist Trity', "Some of our business partners' manufacturing plants<br/>were hit particularly hard. We don't know when<br/>they'll be fully operational again.")
('Receptionist Trity', "But all things considered, this terrorist attack could<br/>have been a lot worse. Our total losses don't amount<br/>to much.")
('Receptionist Trity', 'What, then, was the mafia trying to accomplish...?')
('Receptionist Trity', 'Um, about Professor Callaghan... If you learn of his<br/>whereabouts, please let us know.')
('Receptionist Trity', "We haven't been able to reach him. He's been our<br/>company advisor for years and years, and now he's<br/>just...gone.")
('Receptionist Trity', "I can only hope that he's safe, wherever he is.")
('Receptionist Trity', '*sigh* So the network issues are still ongoing...')
('Receptionist Trity', 'Even our business lines have been spotty as of late.')
('Receptionist Trity', 'It seemed like that was resolved for a second, but...<br/>well, evidently not.')
('Receptionist Trity', "The Verne Company's partnerships bring more than<br/>twenty companies under our umbrella.")
('Receptionist Trity', "Each company is still managed individually, but our<br/>vertical integration strategy puts us on par with the<br/>Empire's own Reinford Company.")
('Receptionist Trity', 'Thanks to this structure, we have over 300 projects<br/>actively in development—though this does introduce<br/>some headaches.')
('Receptionist Trity', 'We managers certainly have our work cut out for us,<br/>juggling those projects and partners all at once.<br/>We manage, though, haha.')
('Chief Valeria', "I see President Rooster's gone home for the day.<br/>He's quite the presence in the office.")
('Chief Valeria', "Our project's hit a major roadblock, unfortunately.<br/>We need more manpower if we want to deliver<br/>on time.")
('Chief Valeria', 'The project itself is highly confidential. If the<br/>president could just agree to our budget, that would<br/>make things a lot easier...')
('Chief Valeria', 'President Rooster, if you could greenlight some<br/>budget allocation for this new project, then we—')
('President Rooster', "Absolutely not. We're stretched too thin as is.")
('President Rooster', "We already have two major projects—we can't handle<br/>a third without new hires. Come back to me with an<br/>impact plan and we'll go from there.")
('Chief Valeria', "That's going to be tricky... We don't have the budget<br/>space to fit much more.")
('Chief Valeria', 'This is a high-priority project direct from<br/>Verne Company.')
('Chief Valeria', 'We would have loved to cooperate on this<br/>project, but...')
('President Rooster', "Well, that's not what I'm worried about. It's more<br/>the budget.")
('Chief Valeria', 'Indeed. This is likely the best compromise available—<br/>this should at least get the project off the ground.')
('President Rooster', "Well, frankly, I don't see what's in it for us. This is a<br/>big responsibility for little benefit down the river.")
('President Rooster', "That said, I've heard grumblings of a<br/>different project...")
('President Rooster', 'I can try and pull some strings for you there.')
('Chief Valeria', 'I appreciate it, but we should be fine. That project is a<br/>bit...unique.')
('Chief Valeria', "Honestly, I don't know much about it myself.<br/>We don't know who's working on it—whatever it is,<br/>it's highly confidential.")
('President Rooster', "So it would seem... I'm not privy to any of that info<br/>myself, either.")
('President Rooster', "(Every company has its secrets, but it's rare to run<br/>into a project even more confidential than our own...<br/>What are they up to there?)")

('President Rooster', "Goodness... I never thought I'd witness something<br/>so horrible.")
('President Rooster', "Our factory faced significant damages. It'll be a while<br/>until we're fully operational again.")
('Chief Valeria', "I had no idea... It's good that our projects weren't<br/>compromised, but our manufacturing side will really<br/>be taking the heat now.")
('Chief Valeria', 'The due date for that government armament contract<br/>really worries me... Can we make it after this?')
('Chief Valeria', "How's our head count looking? Do we have any spare<br/>hands to direct to that?")
('President Rooster', 'Hmm... Can you put together a budget plan? If you<br/>can get us enough to cover repair costs...')
('Chief Valeria', "Certainly! I can get that for you. It's nice to see eye to<br/>eye, heehee.")
('President Rooster', "Indeed. I couldn't possibly hope for more. Let's work<br/>through this together!")
('Chief Valeria', 'Right! Leave the recovery efforts to me!')
('President Rooster', "Good, good. I'll help wherever I can myself.")
('President Rooster', 'Basel is in disarray... We all need to work together to<br/>surmount it!')
('Receptionist Freyd', 'I never thought terrorists would strike here...<br/>Communications are back up, at least.')
('Receptionist Freyd', "We've been swamped with new reservations—there<br/>are tons of people stuck here because they can't<br/>go home.")
('Receptionist Freyd', "I really, really hope we can just get back to<br/>normal soon. I'm getting tired of all this.")
('Receptionist Freyd', 'It was bad enough trying to work through the<br/>network issues. It was driving our online reservation<br/>system haywire.')
('Receptionist Freyd', 'We had double-bookings, outages,<br/>random cancellations... It was a nightmare.')
('Receptionist Freyd', "We've never had to deal with anything like that<br/>before, and I hope we don't have to again.<br/>It's horrifically bad for ratings.")
('Receptionist Freyd', "The students from Aramis are really well behaved,<br/>even at night. Guess that's what going to a<br/>prestigious school does for you.")
('Receptionist Freyd', 'Oh, real quick: was it just me, or did the network feel<br/>really laggy around noon today? I dunno what was up<br/>with that...')
('Receptionist Freyd', "We just had it upgraded, so it's not like our<br/>equipment is bad...")
('Receptionist Freyd', "So Aramis Academy is visiting, huh? I don't recall<br/>them doing that in previous years... Guess this year's<br/>been really good for them.")
('Receptionist Freyd', "Well, Basel's a wonderful place for students to learn<br/>more about engineering. I hope they see<br/>that firsthand.")
('Receptionist Freyd', "And big tech isn't all we have, either—just look<br/>around! The geography here is simply breathtaking.<br/>Our food is well worth the trip, too.")
('Lanmei', 'I-I got caught up in it right in the middle of a work<br/>meeting at Verne...')
('Lanmei', 'I never thought that would happen to me... They put<br/>the meeting on hold for now...')
('Lanmei', 'So Almata was behind it? I remember they had that<br/>attack in Langport recently...')
('Lanmei', "Then Anchorville, and now here, too. I just don't<br/>get it... What's the point? Why are they wreaking all<br/>this havoc...?")
('Lanmei', 'Today we finally meet with the Verne Company to<br/>hammer out a big partnership.')
('Lanmei', "Cooperation with the academic community is one of<br/>Verne's founding principles, so they're pretty<br/>receptive to the idea.")
('Lanmei', "It's just, after the foundation got cut out, things have<br/>been a bit dicey...")
('Lanmei', "But I can't let that get to me. I'm gonna ace this!<br/>Just rehearse and execute!")
('Lanmei', "...O-Okay, maybe 'execute' is a bit much. But I'll get<br/>it done, one way or another!")
('Lanmei', "I gotta focus on bringing everybody together...but<br/>can I? I heard Verne's offices were a mess<br/>this morning...")
('Lanmei', "No, no, bad thoughts! Don't overthink it! Just go!")
('Lanmei', "I recognize those school uniforms... They're from a<br/>really famous academy back in the capital.")
('Lanmei', 'Must be nice to be young! They should take<br/>advantage of that opportunity while they can.')
('Lanmei', "I can't deny I'm envious. I never got to do any fancy<br/>trips or work studies when I was in school.")
('Lanmei', "This is my first time in Basel—I'm here for work.<br/>And I gotta say, this place is every bit as futuristic as<br/>they said!")
('Lanmei', "Langport has its own New Town, but they sure as<br/>heck don't have aerotrams or giant orbal generators.")
('Lanmei', 'This really feels like a cutting-edge city, in<br/>every sense.')
('Agnès', 'I got to visit the observatory and the special<br/>research building. That should give me plenty of<br/>material for my report!')
('Agnès', "I'll join back up with you tomorrow. Let's make sure<br/>to get our parts done!")
('Agnès', 'Ah, Van!')
('Van', "Yo. What's up? You doin' some puzzle solving?")
('Agnès', "Mhm. We're going over all the information<br/>we gathered.")
('Odette', 'Maaan, there was so much to see! And then there was<br/>that surprise right at the end!')
('Chignon', "I know, right? I think I could use a break, though.<br/>There's only so much stuff my brain can handle—<br/>I'm full!")
('Renne', "Heehee. Now, don't just wander around town<br/>aimlessly, okay? You won't have a cohesive report<br/>without cohesive research!")
('Renne', 'You should pick a direction and stick to it, then soak<br/>up as much info as you can tomorrow!')
('Agnès', 'Okay!')
('Van', "(And THERE's the Student Council prez side of her.<br/>Push comes to shove, she's right on top of things.)")
('Risette', 'I understand you have plenty of school work to tend<br/>to, Ms. Claudel, but please make sure to get enough<br/>sleep as well.')
('Agnès', "Don't worry, I will! I'm really looking forward<br/>to tomorrow!")
('Odette', 'We helped out with the evacuation yesterday, and<br/>then that sorta led us here to the hotel.')

('Odette', "Don't push yourselves too much, okay?<br/>You especially, Agnès.")
('Odette', "If things get to be too much, we're always here<br/>to help.")
('Agnès', 'Thank you, Odette. We all need to do our part!')
('Odette', 'Yup, yup! You can count on me!')
('Odette', "Renne's plenty busy, so we need to pick up the slack<br/>as her fellow councilmembers!")
('Odette', "We'll hold down the fort here. Be careful out there,<br/>okay, Agnès?")
('Odette', 'Sounds like you had a pretty productive day out<br/>there, Agnès. Nice!')
('Odette', "We're splitting up tomorrow, too, but I'll be able to<br/>take care of things here.")
('Odette', 'Keep our Agnès safe!')
('Odette', 'Catch you later!')
('Odette', "You have this knack for seeing things we can't. I bet<br/>you'll find plenty of good stuff out there! Tell us all<br/>about it tonight, okay?")
('Chignon', 'I finally got in touch with my family... Whew. I can<br/>finally catch my breath.')
('Chignon', "Mom and Dad were both worried—and I can't blame<br/>them, of course.")
('Chignon', "First we get caught up in a terrorist attack on a field<br/>trip, and now we've got special forces taking us in...")
('Chignon', 'Just my luck, huh? Feels like I walked onto the set of<br/>an action movie by mistake... Haha.')
('Chignon', "I could barely keep myself together. I'm doing a lot<br/>better today, thankfully.")
('Chignon', "It just still doesn't feel real...but I don't have the time<br/>to dwell on that. Gotta keep on truckin',<br/>right, Agnès?")
('Chignon', "Odette, Albert, Julian... They're all amazing.<br/>Just putting themselves out there to help without a<br/>second thought...")
('Chignon', 'So I was talking to the store manager a second<br/>ago, right?')
('Chignon', 'He said the latest consumer-model orbal cameras can<br/>take video, too, like movie cameras do!')
('Chignon', "I'm sure the quality's not as nice—gotta make<br/>concessions for consumer-grade stuff. But man, what<br/>if I could make my own homemade movies?")
('Chignon', "I can't believe you can just do that now...! I'm hyped<br/>outta my mind!")
('Chignon', 'Just think about it! My OWN movie, recorded and<br/>directed myself!')
('Chignon', '...Huh? Wait, is it really only the top-end cameras<br/>that do that? And they cost HOW much?!')
('Chignon', "Aaagh! Goddess, I'm gonna go mad! I gotta get my<br/>hands on one of those, but how?!")
('Chignon', 'Right, gotta sit down and focus on my<br/>report tomorrow.')
('Chignon', "Now, what to write about? I'm thinking maybe<br/>film history...")
('Chignon', "Renne showed me all sorts of stuff. I'd love to write<br/>about the foundation and ZCF's tech, too!")
('Chignon', 'Ugh, why do I have to be POOR?! I want my hands<br/>on all the latest film tech! I want it so bad!')
('Chignon', 'Actually, Renne and the others passed by before.<br/>She said she has something cool to show me!')
('Chignon', "I wonder where she's gonna take me? Oooh, I'm<br/>so curious!")
('Lyle', "So Chignon, why'd you pick Basel, out of curiosity?")
('Lyle', "Isn't Tharbad more the entertainment hot spot?")
('Chignon', "In practice, yes. But where'd all that film equipment<br/>come from? That's right: Basel!")
('Chignon', "Plus, I mean, LOOK at this place! You've got so<br/>many picturesque locations for a film shoot, it's not<br/>even funny!")
('Lyle', "Ah, haha. Got'cha. My bad for asking.")
('Julian', 'He has a point—this city is absolutely stunning.<br/>Maybe we should make a point of going here again.')
('Chignon', "Verne's HQ is huuuge! I mean, I guess I shouldn't be<br/>so surprised—they're the nation's leader in just about<br/>everything, film tech included.")
('Chignon', "Oh, man! This is bleeding edge! There's so much cool<br/>video tech here! Oh, oh, and there's this other<br/>place...!")
('Manager Radad', "I've been putting in orders for replacement materials.<br/>Hopefully we can get back in business soon.")
('Manager Radad', 'Being under direct management should help us a<br/>lot—we can just hit up HQ for whatever parts<br/>we need.')
('Manager Radad', "And on a personal level, I want to be a mediator so<br/>others can get in touch with HQ for help. It's the<br/>least I can do to give back to the city.")
('Manager Radad', 'This lady came in asking for some alloy<br/>machining tools. I ended up selling her some spare<br/>machines we had.')
('Manager Radad', "Guess she's in the market for those alloys herself...<br/>She's probably headed over to Giscard's now.")
('Manager Radad', "The distribution network seems really unstable<br/>right now... I'm worried it might affect our<br/>tuning service.")
('Manager Radad', "I did some digging, and I can confirm it's not just<br/>us—the whole city's running into issues.")
('Manager Radad', "I contacted HQ about it, but they said they don't<br/>have a timetable.")
('Manager Radad', 'We might have to put them in the hot seat, if this<br/>keeps up.')
('Manager Radad', "Education-industry partnership is a big tenet here at<br/>Verne, so we're actively cooperating with the institute<br/>on a variety of projects.")
('Manager Radad', "That's one of the big reasons why we're able to<br/>innovate as much as we do: a lot of students land jobs<br/>at Verne straight out of college.")
('Manager Radad', 'That builds a really strong alumni network, too.<br/>I have a ton of colleagues both here at Verne and at<br/>the institute.')
('Manager Radad', "I might be more of a manager nowadays, but beyond<br/>that, I'm part of the bridge connecting the two<br/>sides together. I find that really fulfilling.")
('Manager Radad', "Welcome to Verne Plaza. We're managed directly by<br/>the Verne Company, so we've got stuff your other<br/>Verne retailers might not.")
('Manager Radad', 'Our first-party management also lets us put in direct<br/>orders for you, among other special services.')
('Manager Radad', "It's one of the many benefits that come with being<br/>right here in Verne's backyard. It's proved a big hit<br/>with customers here.")
('Manager Radad', "We're looking to expand this business model, too.<br/>We want to open first-party Verne stores all across<br/>the country for the best customer experience.")
('Engineer Carter', 'We were expecting to take some losses with arms<br/>sales slowing down, but it still stings.')
('Engineer Carter', "Incidentally, about those two projects—the<br/>equipment for Marduk's security detail and the<br/>engineering behind that new airship...")
('Engineer Carter', "I can't help but wonder how they were constructed.<br/>They look reliable, for sure, but...foreign, all<br/>the same.")
('Engineer Carter', "Foreign as in, I have NEVER seen anything like it<br/>from Calvard's domestic production. As an engineer,<br/>that really gets me thinking...")
('Engineer Carter', "The store's been hit by this orbal instability business,<br/>too, so I went ahead and double-checked our wiring.")
('Engineer Carter', "And as expected, our setup is perfectly fine.<br/>It's something bigger going on in the city...")
('Engineer Carter', "Our manager's talking with HQ to try and get it<br/>fixed, but outside of that, there's nothing we can do.")
('Engineer Carter', "It's good that we're ahead of Reinford in small arms<br/>sales now, but we don't know what to make of<br/>Marduk yet.")
('Engineer Carter', "They're starting to rack up some market share now,<br/>but their inner workings are still a mystery—to say<br/>nothing of their schematics.")
('Engineer Carter', 'And now that they have government backing<br/>themselves, we need to take them seriously.')
('Engineer Carter', "I'd be happy to answer any questions you might<br/>have about weaponry. I'm an engineer, after all.")
('Engineer Carter', 'Verne Company weapons have gotten lots of good<br/>press for their innovation.')
('Engineer Carter', 'Every day now, I get orders from the department<br/>store over in the capital for new parts and supplies.')
('Engineer Carter', "The manager over there can be a bit obsessive, but<br/>once you get to know him, he's pretty sociable.<br/>Working with him's a breeze for me now.")
('Engineer Carter', "If there's anything you need, or any questions you<br/>wanna ask, feel free to pull me aside. I don't mind.")
('Engineer Carter', 'The company sent me here as a temp—that way, we<br/>can gather customer feedback straight from the<br/>ground level.')
('Anna', "Thank the Goddess my husband and I made it out<br/>all right. We were both working at the time, but our<br/>workshops weren't damaged much.")
('Anna', 'I was surprised to see those field trip students<br/>jumping in to help evacuate people.')
('Anna', "They really went out on a limb there, didn't they?<br/>They're still kids!")
('Anna', 'Workers everywhere have been grumbling about<br/>problems with their orbal equipment... I hope they<br/>get that fixed soon.')
('Anna', "It's been a headache for my husband, too—he came<br/>into work and the machines at his workshop just...<br/>wouldn't work.")
('Anna', "I've got orbal lights, orbal appliances... A good chunk<br/>of my home is wired up.")
('Anna', "They say smaller products tend to be less reliable, but<br/>not Verne's. They're really built to last—and they're<br/>full of nifty features, too!")
('Anna', "I went shopping to kill some time. It wasn't all a<br/>waste, though—I got plenty of handy things at the<br/>Verne company store.")
('Anna', "They have just all sorts of stuff here. You can't tell<br/>it's only Verne products by how much they have.<br/>Company stores are something else!")
('Anna', "I'm not buying any of the bigger stuff—that's all out<br/>of my budget. But just browsing is fun in its<br/>own right!")

('Pharmacist Luce', "It's been really hairy... There were a lot of people<br/>injured in the attack, but because of the traffic<br/>restrictions, we're low on medicine...")
('Pharmacist Luce', "But we're working with local pharmacies and medical<br/>companies to try and bridge the gap. We're managing<br/>now, at least.")
('Pharmacist Luce', "Having all that research and production right here in<br/>the city is a real big strength, I've learned.")
('Pharmacist Luce', "It'll be a load off my back once those places are back<br/>to normal. We could use all help we can get...")
('Pharmacist Luce', "We've gotten this volunteer who likes helping out<br/>with errands and stuff. He's been a huge help.")

('Pharmacist Luce', 'I was almost gonna work in Remiferia after I did a<br/>foreign semester there...but Basel gave me an offer,<br/>and I jumped at it.')
('Pharmacist Luce', "It's just so exciting, being able to work with the<br/>cutting edge of the industry. Factor in the academy,<br/>too, and it's a deeply fulfilling job.")
('Pharmacist Luce', "Welcome to Cerise Drugs. We've got all your<br/>medicinal needs, from OTCs to prescriptions from all<br/>the big manufacturers.")
('Pharmacist Luce', "I personally recommend the products made from<br/>Remiferia and Verne Company's joint venture.<br/>They're wonderfully effective!")
('Pharmacist Luce', "With them, you get the best of both worlds:<br/>Remiferia's cutting-edge medicine and Verne's<br/>low costs.")
('Pharmacist Luce', "They may be a startup, but their quality speaks<br/>for itself. If you're in need of medicine, give them<br/>a shot!")
('De Niro', "It's awful, just...awful. But I can't sit idly by—I want<br/>to help however I can.")

('De Niro', "Luce is really cool. She's so calm and collected, and<br/>she's really good at what she does!")
('De Niro', "She's like the opposite of me. I just go hopping from<br/>one odd job to another, but she's landed her dream<br/>job already.")
('De Niro', 'Maybe I should take notes and figure out what I<br/>wanna do...')
('De Niro', "Y'know, maybe I can just start working at<br/>the pharmacy? I think I'm on good terms with Luce<br/>now—maybe she can teach me.")

('De Niro', '...Man, I wonder if I count as a regular now, haha.<br/>I come here too often. You reckon the pharmacist<br/>knows me by name?')
('De Niro', "Compared to her, I'm just... She really isn't that much<br/>older than me, but she has her dream job<br/>and everything. She's amazing...")
('De Niro', "...Bleh, I'm getting distracted. Gotta finish up my<br/>errands for the night, I need some detergent and<br/>canned foods...")
('De Niro', "My folks are out of town for work, so I gotta clean<br/>the place up before they get back. I don't wanna<br/>THINK about what they'll do if I forget.")

('Van', "Ideally, that should be zero, yeah? Smells to me like<br/>there's still some stuff to figure out there.")
('Van', "And that ain't the only issue you're dealing with, is it?<br/>What about the swell of 'visitors' buzzin' around<br/>the city?")
('CEO Tausend', '...Is that not obvious?')
('CEO Tausend', "Basel is the beating heart of Calvard's industrial<br/>sector, home to my Verne Group and nearly one<br/>hundred partners and subsidiaries.")
('CEO Tausend', "That's thousands upon thousands of employees,<br/>contractors, managers, all acting of their own accord.<br/>New hires from all over come in every day.")
('CEO Tausend', 'So naturally the city appears busy. An influx of<br/>visitors, particularly at this time of year, is nothing to<br/>fret over.')
('Aaron', "Even bad faith visitors? Spies are all the rage these<br/>days, y'know.")
('CEO Tausend', 'Hmph...')
('CEO Tausend', "...I'm not sure what you've heard out there, but I'd<br/>advise against parroting such unsubstantiated claims.<br/>Your evidence, please?")
('Risette', "Though we've yet to investigate this issue, your<br/>dodging of the question implies you also lack the<br/>evidence to prove or deny the allegations.")
('Risette', "That's what we're here for, Mr. Tausend: to conduct<br/>this investigation on your behalf.")
('Van', "So, yeah. If we find anything—and I do mean<br/>anything—we'll let'cha know.")
('CEO Tausend', 'Frrgh...')
('CEO Tausend', '...Fine, do what you will. Squabbling further over this<br/>would be a waste of time.')
('CEO Tausend', 'Salision, if you would.')
('System', 'Received D-rank ID certification.')
('Van', 'Oh, yeah. I heard about these...')
('Quatre', 'These are temporary-issue security cards for visitors<br/>such as yourselves. The city implemented them<br/>last year.')
('Quatre', "With these, you're free to use the aerotram to travel<br/>to New Town and the Artisanal District.")
('Quatre', "You can't take the upper-level aerotram to the<br/>Institute of Science, however.")
('Feri', 'Huh? Why not...?')
('Aaron', 'Wait, hold up—')
('Van', "'Preciate it. We'll go and get to work, then.")
('CEO Tausend', 'Wait. Given our public position, we have to make<br/>sure the principality saves face.')
('CEO Tausend', "I personally don't think this warrants an investigation<br/>by the likes of you, but we nevertheless prepared a<br/>point of contact for you.")
('Quatre', "My name is Quatre Salision. I'm an assistant at the<br/>Institute of Science.")
('Quatre', "I have other business to attend to, so I can't always<br/>provide you with support...")
('Quatre', "...but should you have any questions, you're welcome<br/>to contact me.")
('Van', "Well, we'd appreciate that.")
(40301, 'Contact information exchanged!')
('Quatre', "Huh... That's an unusual holo.")
('Van', "Ah, don't worry about that. Actually, if you don't<br/>mind me askin'...")
('Quatre', '...? Yes?')
('Van', "No, it's just—don't take this the wrong way, okay?")
('Van', 'I was just wondering what pronouns to use for you.')
('Quatre', '...')
('Quatre', '...Huh?')
('Aaron', 'Are you out of your mind?')
('Feri', "Umm... Quatre is very pretty, but he doesn't really<br/>have a female physique.")
('Quatre', "...Of course I don't! I'm a guy!")
('Van', "Look, seriously, I'm sorry.")
('Van', "You're about fourteen or so, give or take? At that age,<br/>I figured it was possible you could be either.")
('Van', "You must've skipped more than a few grades if you're<br/>an assistant at the institute.")
('Quatre', "...I suppose you could say that. I'm actually fifteen, by<br/>the way.")
('Quatre', "Hmph. But I guess it's fine—sometimes people do<br/>get the wrong idea from afar.")
('Feri', "(I wasn't sure at first with the way his coat covers<br/>him, either...)")
('Aaron', '(Yeah, but who makes the mistake as close as he is?<br/>Man, I sure as shit do NOT want to get old.)')
('Risette', '(Hmm...)')
('CEO Tausend', "Enough! If you're all done, then please, get out<br/>of here!")
('CEO Tausend', "I'm a busy man. After this, I—")
(40301, 'Mr. Tausend, sir, the students from Aramis Academy<br/>have arrived.')
('CEO Tausend', 'Already? Well, let them through.')
('CEO Tausend', "Salision, I'll be counting on you yet again.")
('CEO Tausend', "You're staying for three days, yes? Hmph. Good luck<br/>'clearing out the gutter,' so to speak.")
('Aaron', 'Tch. Not even trying to be subtle.')
('Aaron', "He's a real pain in the ass, but that makes it easier for<br/>us to move around, at least. Works for me.")
('Van', "Heh. Now you're starting to get it.")
('Aaron', 'Oh, shut up.')
('Feri', "He said there were no problems, but he certainly<br/>didn't act like that was the case.")
('Risette', 'Agreed. He might not have the answers, but he most<br/>certainly has cause for concern. Or, at least, that is<br/>how it appeared to me.')
('Risette', "I don't believe it will be easy to get anything out<br/>of him.")
('Van', "I don't believe ANY part of this is gonna be easy.<br/>We'll have to tackle it from a few different angles.")
('Van', 'Which means...')
('Agnès', 'Ah...')
('Renne', 'Oh?')
('Chignon', "Aren't they...?")
('Julian', 'They were in front of Central Station this morning.')
('Lyle', "S-So he really is Agnès' boyfriend from her<br/>part-time gig?!")
('Agnès', "...Lyle, I told you that's not true.")
('Lyle', 'Right. My bad.')
('Van', "How's it goin', good students? We're just here<br/>for work.")
('Van', 'Good luck with the whole school trip thing.')
('Odette', "(Heehee. I know I'M in her corner.)")
('Albert', '(I still want no part in any of this.)')
('Quatre', 'Er, welcome, students of Aramis. Right this way.')
('Quatre', 'These are your C-rank certification cards.')
('Quatre', "They're primarily for outside trainees, so you will have<br/>access to the institute and the aerotram.")
('Agnès', 'Thank you very much.')
('Odette', 'Wowee! So we can ride the aerotram as much as<br/>we want?')
('Albert', 'And we can visit the Institute of Science... This will<br/>help our reports big time.')
('Renne', 'Then each group is free to do what they want.')
('Renne', "We'll meet back up at the hotel lobby around 6:30.<br/>Remember: you'll be punished if you're late. ❤")
('Chignon', "Y-Yes, ma'am!")
('Lyle', "You won't catch ME being late!")
('Sasha', "Hey, now. Don't threaten the first years.")
('Julian', "Anyway, let's make sure this visit is a fruitful one.")
('James', "Hmph. Let's get moving, underclassmen.")
('Quatre', "Then I'll leave you all to it.")
('Quatre', 'If you need anything at all, just contact me via the<br/>number I gave you. See you—')
('Renne', 'Hold on a second, Quatre Salision.')
('Renne', "I've heard quite a few things about you—like how<br/>you're the professor's favorite student.")
('Quatre', 'Uh...?')
('Odette', 'Hmm...?')
('Albert', 'Renne?')
('Agnès', '(Wait. Then...)')
('Renne', "You see, I'm a foreign exchange student from Liberl,<br/>so we just so happened to have met through a contact<br/>at ZCF.")
('Renne', 'We had quite the wonderful chat after she read all<br/>of my past papers.')
('Quatre', "ZCF? I've met both Professor Russell and his<br/>daughter, so—")
('Quatre', "Wait... Papers? Don't tell me you're...?!")
('Renne', 'Heehee. Oh, never you mind that. To circle back to<br/>my original point, I have a request to ask of you.')
('Renne', 'My friend here will be operating on her own. Could I<br/>ask you to take her to the Artisanal District for me?')
('Agnès', 'Renne...')
('Albert', "...I see. So you're already getting a move on, then?")
('Odette', 'Aww... And I was hoping we could hang out for a<br/>little bit, too.')
('Agnès', 'Sorry for deciding this on my own, you two.')
('Odette', "Nah, it's fine. We've got three whole days, right?<br/>And you'll be back come nighttime anyway.")
('Odette', "We'll be counting on one heck of a report!")
('Albert', 'Just be careful, okay?')
('Agnès', 'Of course!')
('Quatre', 'Is this...perhaps related to...?')
('Quatre', "In any event, I don't mind. I just so happen to have<br/>business in the Artisanal District, so it works out.")
('Quatre', "I'll show you the way...umm...")
('Agnès', "Agnès Claudel. I'm a first year at Aramis Academy.")
('Agnès', "It's a pleasure to meet you.")
('Quatre', '...Likewise.')
('Albert', '(Hmm?)')
('Odette', '(Ooh... / Well, well...)')
('Agnès', "Then I'm counting on you to lead the way,<br/>Mr. Salision.")
('Quatre', 'Of course. Happily.')
('Quatre', "Once we catch the aerotram, we'll be at the Artisanal<br/>District in no time at all.")
('Quatre', "By the way, you're older than me, aren't you?")
('Quatre', "'Mr.' might be a little stiff. You can just call me<br/>Quatre if that's all right.")
('Agnès', "You don't mind? Heehee! Then Quatre it is!")
('Agnès', "Oh, but I'm only older than you by a year, so I don't<br/>want you to be too stiff with me, either. Why don't<br/>we talk like we're old friends?")
('Quatre', "Umm... Okay. I'll keep it casual, then.")
('Quatre', "I get the feeling you're always told to loosen up a<br/>little more?")
('Agnès', "That's right. My friends never let me hear the end of<br/>it, but I can't help the way I talk.")
('Agnès', "I know I'm repeating myself, but it really is a<br/>pleasure, Quatre.")
('Quatre', 'Same to you. Now, uh, should we get going?')
('Agnès', "You don't see aerotrams much across the continent,<br/>do you?")
('Quatre', "I'd call them a must with where Basel is located.")
('Quatre', 'New Town, the Artisanal District, the Institute<br/>of Science... It travels along a loop and helps<br/>consistently deliver parts wherever needed.')
('Quatre', "The Artisanal District's platform is on the right.<br/>Just tap your card against the ticket gate.")
('Agnès', 'All right. Let me give it a try.')
('Agnès', 'What a spectacular view! ...Though I get a little dizzy<br/>when I look down.')
('Agnès', 'And wow! New Town is already so far away!')
('Quatre', 'Enjoying yourself?')
('Agnès', 'Yes! Tremendously!')
('Agnès', "I bet Feri would enjoy this, too. I wonder if she's<br/>gotten the chance to ride yet...")
('Quatre', '(She really is so cute...but how is someone like her<br/>connected to those others?)')
('Aaron', 'Tch. Even the locals barely use it.')
('Van', "That's because most either go by car or use<br/>the aerotram.")
('Feri', 'You rode the aerotram, right? How was it?')
('Agnès', 'It had the best view! ...But it was a little scary, too.')
('Agnès', "I didn't think there'd be a difference in ranks...<br/>Have you never used the aerotram in the past, Van?")
('Van', 'Nah, I got to ride it when I came here a couple<br/>years ago. Just had a regular old ticket.')
('Van', "From what I hear, security within the city's<br/>undergone a massive overhaul.")
('Risette', 'After the war, the government ordered a total reform.')
('Risette', "I don't find it surprising that they would want to be<br/>very careful with an experimental city that is very<br/>nearly a national secret.")
('Aaron', 'Okay, but tell me how that puts us at a lower rank<br/>than a bunch of kids here on a school trip?')
('Feri', "I don't think it's that they're high—I think it's more<br/>that we're low.")
('Van', "Eh, still, it's not a big deal. As long as we can drive.")
('Van', "By the way, pretty sure we'll eventually bump into<br/>your classmates. You okay on that end?")
('Agnès', "I'm fine. I've explained things to them for the<br/>most part.")
('Agnès', "They might happen upon some info before us, so if<br/>we see them, let's make it a point to ask.")
('Agnès', 'This building is...')
('Van', "Liberl's ZCF and the Epstein Foundation, eh?")
('Aaron', "The foreign tech foundation established using your<br/>great-grandfather's cash, right?")
('Aaron', "With how famous it is even in the Republic, it's kinda<br/>funny that it's been dumped over in the corner<br/>like this.")
('Agnès', '...')
('Feri', "You're so rude, Aaron.")
('Agnès', "Ahaha... It's fine.")
('Agnès', "But before, all the big buildings were part of the<br/>foundation's branch here.")
('Risette', 'Indeed. As a part of their downsizing in the Republic,<br/>they moved to this location.')
('Risette', 'Its performance in other countries remains<br/>stable, but...')
('Van', "With tech goin' the way it is, it's only natural there'd<br/>be a dip in business.")
('Agnès', 'Right. With the Xipha...')
('Feri', "What was it before, again? I think they're doing the<br/>rounds underground...")
('Van', 'RAMDA. Fifth gen, co-developed by Verne<br/>and Epstein.')
('Van', 'What the sixth gen would look like sparked a hell of a<br/>lot of conversation both before and after the war.')
('Van', "Then they went and pulled what even the Empire's<br/>Reinford Company didn't dare do: cut the foundation<br/>out of the equation.")
('Risette', 'It caused some pushback across the continent at first,<br/>but now their technology is well on the road to being<br/>available to the public.')
('Risette', "And they'll do anything to keep themselves in their<br/>current favorable position, I would imagine—even use<br/>Marduk for practical testing.")
('Risette', "Though perhaps it isn't my place to weigh in on<br/>the matter.")
('Aaron', 'You got that right.')
('Agnès', '(And the one pushing that as national policy is...)')
('Feri', 'So ZCF was the one that developed airships, right?')
('Risette', "Yes. They're a facility located in Zeiss in Liberl.")
('Agnès', 'You can find their products all across the Republic—<br/>things like communications equipment or<br/>household goods.')
('Albert', 'Being a friendly nation, they do have a cooperative<br/>enough partnership with Verne, I suppose.')
('Agnès', 'Oh! Hello there.')
('Odette', 'Hiya, Van and friends!')
('Odette', 'And look at you go, Agnès. Hard at work, I see.')
('Albert', '...Hmph.')
('Julian', 'We heard what you were doing earlier.')
('Chignon', "You're researching with your coworkers as part of<br/>your visitation, yeah?")
('Agnès', "I am. I hope you don't mind me going off on<br/>my own.")
('Van', "Well, she's puttin' the work in. You guys have<br/>business here?")
('Renne', 'We do. I have personal connections with ZCF and<br/>the foundation, you see.')
('Renne', 'So I thought this would be the perfect place to get a<br/>firsthand look at international<br/>technological exchange.')
('Julian', "What she said. As someone from the Empire, it's a<br/>topic I personally can't get enough of.")
('Chignon', 'And I heard they make memory quartz for films<br/>and stuff! How could I not wanna come?!')
('Agnès', "How nice. I'm sure there will be an endless amount of<br/>information to absorb there.")
('Albert', "Just leave this part to us. We'll be sure to write up a<br/>report for you.")
('Odette', 'But you better nab us some sweet scoops in exchange!')
('Professor Cronkite', 'Hmm?')
('Professor Cronkite', 'What are students doing here? ...Of course—the<br/>educational visitation.')
('Albert', "W-We didn't mean to crowd up the path.")
('Odette', "Waaait. I've seen him before...")
('Van', '(I think I recognize him, too.)')
('Risette', "(I'm sure you do. He is rather famous.)")
('Renne', 'Greetings, Professor.')
('Renne', "My name is Renne Bright. I've heard all about you<br/>from a certain other professor.")
('Professor Cronkite', "Ahh. I didn't realize you were studying abroad here.")
('Professor Cronkite', 'Cronkite. I believe this is our first time meeting<br/>in person.')
('Professor Cronkite', 'I found your papers fascinating, I must say.<br/>Welcome to Basel.')
('Albert', 'Huh...')
('Agnès', '(Papers?)')
('Renne', "Heehee. It's an honor to have my work read by such a<br/>brilliant mind.")
('Renne', 'Might I trouble you for some time to chat in the<br/>near future?')
('Professor Cronkite', "I would welcome the chance—though I'll have to pass<br/>on speaking at length with your classmates.")
('Professor Cronkite', "Now, I am a busy man, I'm afraid, so if you don't<br/>mind, I will bid you farewell.")
('Aaron', "Well, that stick couldn't be farther up his ass, but he's<br/>got the chops to back it up.")
('Feri', 'Yeah... His background is Eastern, right?')
('Renne', "That was Professor Yang Cronkite—the young<br/>genius carrying the Republic's engineering<br/>community on his shoulders.")
('Renne', "He's been presenting groundbreaking tech across all<br/>kinds of fields since before the war two years ago.")
('Odette', 'Oh! Now that you mention it, I think I saw him in<br/>the Tyrell Times.')
('Albert', "He's said to be a genius the likes of which we<br/>haven't seen since Professor Hamilton.")
('Albert', 'But how are you connected to someone like him,<br/>Re—')
('Renne', 'I believe the others are waiting, so how about we go?')
('Renne', "Don't be late for the meetup, Agnès—otherwise I'll<br/>have to give you a good spanking. ♪")
('Agnès', 'Heehee. I know, I know. Have fun leading everyone!')
('Albert', "H-Hold on, Renne! Don't think you can get away<br/>with not answering!")
('Odette', 'Ahaha! Well, then, good luck with work!')
('Van', 'Shall we?')
('Agnès', "Yes! Let's give this our all!")
('Van', "I'd say we've seen everything there is to see in<br/>New Town. That said...")
('Feri', "Looks like we'll have to go to the institute for that<br/>request from the assistant.")
('Aaron', "The one about that professor abusing his power, eh?<br/>Doesn't seem like something outsiders like us should<br/>get in the middle of.")
('Agnès', "But I'm concerned since it was posted as a 4SPG.")
('Agnès', 'I wonder if we can find a way for all of us to get into<br/>the institute...')
('Risette', 'Like with the aerotram, access requires Rank C<br/>certification or higher.')
('Van', "Hmm... It'd be nice if we could have Elsaim put on<br/>the pressure and get our ranks raised, but that won't<br/>work here. Not enough time.")
('Van', 'So how about we go have a little talk?')
('Feri', 'With who?')
('Aaron', 'Ah. The kiddo from earlier?')
('Aaron', "He wasn't as bad about it as the CEO, but he still had<br/>his doubts about us.")
('Van', "Well, if pushing doesn't work, we just gotta pull.")
('Van', "So thanks for bein' our go-between, Agnès.")
('Agnès', 'Er... For what? Between you and Quatre?')
('Van', "You got it. You guys seemed to hit it off—guessin' it's<br/>'cause you're so close in age.")
('Van', "He'll be up for talkin' to you. Just make it seem like<br/>you've got problems and he can solve 'em.")
('Agnès', "Oh, I don't think I'll need to go that far. I'm sure if<br/>I'm just honest and upfront with him, he'll listen.")
('Agnès', "But I am happy to help. Once things settle down, I'll<br/>give him a call on my Xipha.")
('Aaron', "(Ha. Girl doesn't have a clue, huh?)")
('Risette', '(Heehee. It is quite charming how unaware she is of<br/>her appeal.)')
('Feri', "(I don't really get what you're saying, but I know we<br/>can count on Agnès to handle this!)")
('System', "To advance the main story, select 'Contact Quatre'<br/>from the Travel menu.")
('Odette', "Mmgh... I can't eat another bite of engadin...")
('Agnès', 'Heehee. Looks like you guys did the rounds.')
('Renne', 'We sure did—though we may have overdid it a tad<br/>for it being our first day.')
('Renne', 'But now I have a better idea of just what is happening<br/>in this city.')
('Agnès', 'You do...?')
('Agnès', 'Does parallel-distributed computing really consume<br/>that much orbal energy?')
('Agnès', "It's when you borrow the processing power of<br/>multiple computers through the net to do greater<br/>calculations, right?")
('Renne', "I'm impressed you know about such<br/>cutting-edge tech.")
('Renne', "Now, connecting a few terminals isn't going to<br/>consume much energy at all.")
('Renne', 'But what do you think would happen if one were to<br/>connect all the terminals in the city?')
('Agnès', 'Then do you think hacking is behind this?')
('Renne', "The flow of the orbal distribution network looks to<br/>me like it's being manipulated.")
('Renne', 'If you intentionally adjust its flow on an erratic<br/>schedule, you can make it seem like issues are<br/>occurring at random.')
('Renne', 'You might even call doing just that my specialty—<br/>though I find this here to be a distastefully crafty way<br/>of going about it.')
('Renne', 'It was around the most recent occupation<br/>of Crossbell.')
('Renne', 'There were miracles and calamities born from<br/>large-scale distributed processing that should have<br/>been impossible with our current tech.')
('Renne', 'So impossible that I never thought the same could<br/>happen here in the Republic, even if this is on a<br/>smaller scale.')
('Agnès', '...What?')
('CEO Tausend', 'Just what is going on here?!')
('CEO Tausend', "Professor Callaghan has gone missing, and you're<br/>here with some evidence that he's been abusing<br/>his power?!")
('CEO Tausend', 'Even the police and guild have barged into the<br/>institute wanting to question me!')
('CEO Tausend', 'You people have been here for a day. A DAY!<br/>Are you some sort of plague being brought down<br/>upon us?!')
('Quatre', "...It's not their fault.")
('Quatre', "This is Professor Callaghan's problem—no, it's all<br/>of our problem.")
('Agnès', 'Quatre...')
('Aaron', "Don't act like you didn't know about assistants being<br/>harassed left and right.")
('CEO Tausend', 'Ugh... Just what did you want me to do about it in<br/>my position?')
('CEO Tausend', "It's not my place to say anything about his research!")
('Risette', "I'm sure that is one of the difficult things about being<br/>a joint venture group funded by multiple investors.")
('Risette', 'But I also imagine the benefits outweigh<br/>the difficulties.')
('Van', 'Anyone could see that the professor was on<br/>a rampage.')
('Van', 'And the problems with the orbal network and its<br/>distribution are just as clear.')
('Van', 'Let me just shoot straight with you: was that<br/>professor linked to any strange groups?')
('Van', 'You know, like the mafia or anything?')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "Hmm... I'd like to believe that he wasn't, but I can't<br/>say for sure.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "It's pretty normal for the Institute of Science and<br/>Verne Company to accept outside funding.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', 'In other words, the ground is fertile for corruption.')
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "And I can't write off the possibility with all those new<br/>terminals he suddenly had on him.")
('CEO Tausend', 'S-Stop this pointless conjecture! You have<br/>no evidence!')
('CEO Tausend', 'If rumors like this were to leak to the public during<br/>such a crucial time—')
('Chief Engineer Giscard', 'How about acting like a leader for once in<br/>your damn life?!')
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "These youngsters were hired so the police and the<br/>guild wouldn't have to get involved!")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', 'And while we sit here scrambling for answers, who<br/>knows what Professor Callaghan is up to?!')
('Chief Engineer Giscard', 'Tell me: is there ever going to be a better time than<br/>now to step up as CEO, Bill?!')
('CEO Tausend', 'Ngh...')
('Quatre', 'Supervisor...')
('CEO Tausend', "...Fine. I'll tell you everything I know.")
('CEO Tausend', 'But please, keep this just between us.')
('Agnès', 'Of course. Our team always keeps matters like<br/>this confidential.')
('Agnès', "We're contracted with one of your biggest<br/>shareholders, the Principality of Elsaim—we have<br/>nothing to gain from hurting your image.")
('Van', "And everything to gain from earnin' some brownie<br/>points with Verne.")
('CEO Tausend', 'Mgh...')
('CEO Tausend', 'Professor Callaghan first began to change around a<br/>year or two ago.')
('CEO Tausend', "We'd received a request from the Republican Army<br/>to develop the next generation of weapons—<br/>something he excelled in.")
('CEO Tausend', "But when the time came to propose ideas, he lost in<br/>his own field. Professor Cronkite's was accepted.")
('Quatre', '...')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'I knew that was it.')
('CEO Tausend', "Ever since, he's been doing research on his own like a<br/>man possessed.")
('CEO Tausend', "I don't know what it is he started researching, but<br/>whatever it was, it required an immense amount of<br/>capital and manpower.")
('CEO Tausend', 'There came a point where he started seeking out<br/>every sponsor he could.')
('CEO Tausend', 'Then half a year ago, I heard a place called the<br/>Anchorville Company offered an unprecedented<br/>amount of money.')
('Risette', 'That name...')
('Van', 'So it got caught in your information network,<br/>too, eh?')
('Aaron', "Don't tell me this is the same thing as in Langport.")
('Risette', 'Indeed. The Anchorville Company, much like the<br/>Messeldam Trading Company...')
('Risette', '...is also one of their shell corporations.')
('Feri', '...!')
('Quatre', 'Who are we talking about?')
('Agnès', '...A certain mafia.')
('Agnès', "They're called Almata, and they're on both the guild<br/>and the police's radars.")
('Quatre', 'What?!')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'P-Professor Callaghan was involved with people like<br/>that...?')
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "I've heard the rumors. Been expanding their territory<br/>an awful lot of late.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', 'Just how the hell could you have overlooked<br/>something like this?!')
('CEO Tausend', "I-It's not my fault! I only got the info the other day!")
('CEO Tausend', 'A-And what else could I do? Do you know what<br/>could happen to me if I put a pause on research for<br/>the mafia?')
('Chief Engineer Giscard', 'Think about the poor assistants who ended up<br/>helping them without even realizing it!')
('Van', 'So after losing against the genius professor, he started<br/>focusing entirely on his own research...')
('Van', "My bet's that he's stickin' to his same field<br/>of expertise.")
('Quatre', '...!')
('Agnès', 'And if the mafia has invested massive funds into<br/>his work...')
('Feri', 'I have a bad feeling about this. A really bad feeling.')
('Quatre', 'The network delay that dropped down to .35% has<br/>gotten worse again as of this morning, too.')
('Quatre', "That makes it highly possible that he's continuing his<br/>research in another location.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'But just where on earth could that be?')
('Van', 'Sounds like we got a good old-fashioned manhunt on<br/>our hands.')
('Van', "We're gonna be combin' through this place way more<br/>than what we did yesterday. I take it there are<br/>no objections?")
('CEO Tausend', "...I don't like it, but I know it must be done.")
('Aaron', 'Better give our cards the proper ranks, then.')
('CEO Tausend', 'Tch... Fine! Give me your cards!')
('Risette', 'Rank B—the certification level you mentioned.')
('Chief Engineer Giscard', 'Heh. That one almost never gets issued.')
('Aaron', "I'm not trying to bitch, but may as well just give us<br/>Rank A at this point.")
('Van', "Don't ask for the impossible. 'Sides, we'll be able to<br/>get around much better than we could yesterday<br/>with these.")
('Feri', "Let's get to work. Time to get one over that mafia!")
('Quatre', '...I have a favor to ask.')
('Quatre', 'If at all possible, do you think I could<br/>accompany you?')
('Agnès', 'Oh?')
('Quatre', "As Professor Hamilton's student, this situation with<br/>Professor Callaghan isn't entirely unrelated to me.")
('Quatre', 'And I very much consider it my job to do something<br/>about it in her stead. Please, let me come with you.')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'Quatre...')
('Van', "Eh, that's fine with me.")
('Van', 'But just to give you a heads up, our work<br/>takes priority.')
('Van', "That means you're gonna be taggin' along while we<br/>take care of business. That gonna be a problem?")
('Quatre', "You mean like yesterday? That's fine. I wouldn't even<br/>mind helping out if there's anything I can do.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "Well, we're counting on you guys! I'll reach out to my<br/>contacts and see what I can dig up while you're at it.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "And just don't do anything tooooo crazy,<br/>okay, Quatre?")
('Quatre', "Don't worry so much, Essy. I'm in good company.")
('Quatre', "But whatever it takes, I'm determined to set things<br/>right while she's not here to do it herself.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', '...I know.')
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "I'll start talking to any dealers who supplied Professor<br/>Callaghan with parts.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "If I hear anything back, I'll let you know. Take good<br/>care of the boy.")
('Van', 'Yeah. You got it.')
('Van', "By the way, Agnès...it glowed last night, didn't it?")
('Agnès', '...It did, yes.')
('Agnès', "Most likely at the same time as when Professor<br/>Callaghan's final transmission went out.")
('Feri', "We're getting close, then.")
('Agnès', 'Yes. The last time the Genesis glowed like that was...')
('Quatre', "Erm... What are you talking about? What's<br/>a Genesis?")
('Van', "Ah, don't worry about it. Work stuff. I'm sure we'll<br/>fill you in eventually.")
('Agnès', "I hope you don't mind, Quatre.")
('Quatre', 'If you say so... It must be something that could take a<br/>while to explain.')
('Quatre', 'So, where should we start?')
('Quatre', "If possible, I'd like to first speak to Yang. You would<br/>better know him as Professor Cronkite.")
('Van', "The guy our missing professor had beef with, right?<br/>Yeah, I bet he'd know a thing or two about<br/>his research.")
('Van', "Sounds good to me. Plus I think it's about time we<br/>have a little talk with yesterday's client.")
('Feri', 'The anonymous one?')
('Aaron', "Not so anonymous to us at this point. Come on—let's<br/>settle the score.")
('Quatre', "So we'll be making the rounds through New Town<br/>and the Artisanal District before heading to the<br/>Institute of Science.")
('Risette', 'That sounds perfect. Then may day two of our<br/>work begin.')
('System', 'Quatre joined the party.')
('Quatre', 'Yang!')
('Van', 'Finally found you.')
('Professor Cronkite', 'Quatre...and that group with the spriggan, correct?')
('Professor Cronkite', 'I expected you might be coming to find me soon.')
('Agnès', '(Strange how the man we just so happened to casually<br/>run into twice already is doing such incredible work<br/>for the Republican Army.)')
('Feri', "(Yeah. He's developing weapons like those big<br/>humanoid things, right?)")
('Risette', '(Correct. He is quite a known figure within Marduk.)')
('Van', "Pleasure seeing you again. It's a real honor that such<br/>an esteemed professor remembers folks like us.")
('Van', "And since you do, I imagine you've got a pretty good<br/>idea of why we're here?")
('Professor Cronkite', 'I do, considering your position and recent events.')
('Professor Cronkite', '...Professor Callaghan truly has left me in quite<br/>a predicament.')
('Professor Cronkite', 'His ties to the instability of the orbal network and its<br/>distribution, as well as the mafia, were unfortunate<br/>enough on their own...')
('Professor Cronkite', '...but now here you are, dragging me into it.')
('Feri', 'H-How did you know all of that?')
('Aaron', 'You get all that from the CEO?')
('Professor Cronkite', 'No? The logic is simple enough.')
('Professor Cronkite', "One need only link the subject of his research to the<br/>timing of the city's recent dilemmas for the pieces to<br/>fall into place.")
('Professor Cronkite', 'There is also that vast sum of money he received from<br/>an unknown source and various inexplicable<br/>phenomena to consider.')
('Professor Cronkite', 'It all shares a lot in common with those perplexing<br/>incidents that have taken place across the Republic<br/>the past few months.')
('Professor Cronkite', 'The ones related to Almata and their<br/>ever-expanding influence. Now, am I wrong?')
('Feri', 'Whoa!')
('Agnès', "I'm amazed that you could connect the dots<br/>so precisely...")
('Quatre', 'Then we have all we—')
('Professor Cronkite', '—need? Do you really?')
('Quatre', "...Right. It's a researcher's duty to substantiate a<br/>working theory by accumulating proof.")
('Quatre', 'Any conclusion that skips over this process holds<br/>no value.')
('Professor Cronkite', "As I've so often told you.")
('Professor Cronkite', 'Ultimately, you must arrive at your own conclusion as<br/>a fellow researcher.')
('Professor Cronkite', 'Though I would not be against offering you my<br/>guidance as I did when you completed FIO<br/>and XEROS.')
('Professor Cronkite', "I shall be on my way, then. I've much research that<br/>requires my attention.")
('Aaron', '(This guy is such a pain in the ass!)')
('Feri', '(A-And here I thought he was gonna be our<br/>next lead!)')
('Van', '(Do you mind, Agnès?)')
('Agnès', '(...No. I understand.)')
('Van', 'Just a minute, please.')
('Van', "Researchers don't work all on their own to find<br/>answers, right?")
('Van', 'The wisdom they gain is built on the research and<br/>papers of people who came before them.')
('Quatre', 'Oh...')
('Professor Cronkite', 'True, I cannot deny that. And?')
('Van', "I was just thinkin' we could exchange info. Make<br/>a deal.")
('Van', 'We happen to have something that pertains to those<br/>inexplicable phenomena you brought up.')
('Van', "If you'd be open to givin' us a little more of your time,<br/>I think we and that something could make it worth<br/>your while.")
('Professor Cronkite', '...Oh?')
('Risette', 'You mean...')
('Feri', 'Is it the Genesis?')
('Quatre', 'Hmm...?')
('Professor Cronkite', "Very well, then. I'm intrigued.")
('Professor Cronkite', "I'd like to see this 'something' that relates to all the<br/>incidents taking place across the Republic.")
('Professor Cronkite', 'This puzzle piece that appears neither to be an<br/>artifact nor the singularity from a year and a half ago.<br/>Well? Where is it?')
(40301, 'EEEEEK!')
(40302, 'Aaaaah!')
('Albert', 'R-Renne?!')
('Renne', 'Oh, my. Looks like you caught me. So, did you get<br/>everyone to safety?')
('Odette', "W-We did, but what's going on?!")
('Aaron', 'What the shit? These guys serious?!')
('Quatre', 'The city is...!')
('Feri', 'Why are they going after innocent people?!')
(40301, 'H-Help! Somebody, HELP!')
('Agnès', 'There are still people trapped in the city!')
('Van', "Tch. Goin' to hell in a handbasket real fast...<br/>Look alive, gang. Let's get these guys evacuated!")
('Agnès', 'Are you all right?!')
('Van', "Take cover indoors! We'll be invoicing Verne for this,<br/>so don't you worry!")
(40301, 'H-Huh?!')
(40302, "O-Okay?! Well, thanks! We'll hole up here!")
('Bracer Alvis', 'Wha—you—what the hell, man?!')
('Van', 'Howdy. Just wrapped things up here.')
('Bracer Alvis', "That's not the... You're really out here CHARGING<br/>people during a terrorist attack?!")
('Bracer Alvis', 'It was bad enough when you did it in Creil—')
('Bracer Regina', 'Not the time for this, Alvis! We need all the free<br/>hands we can get!')

('Odette', "*pant* *pant* Oh, thank goodness! I'm so glad<br/>you're okay!")
('Van', "Looks like a ton got in. How're things on your end?")
('Albert', 'We evacuated all of the students. The other groups<br/>should also be somewhere safe.')
('Renne', 'I wish I had better news about the comms situation.')
('Renne', 'I did what I could to give instructions to the police<br/>and the other bracers.')
('Bracer Regina', 'Wha—? Since when?!')
('Bracer Alvis', "Wait, I remember Zin talking about you! He said<br/>something about 'the Bright family's youngest'...")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "It's very reassuring to have you here.")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "I'm curious as to how you saw this coming, but we've<br/>got more pressing things to worry about.")
('Renne', "Call it the Council President's intuition.")
('Renne', "And besides: they can't just hold a tea party like this<br/>and not invite me!")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "Well...I've no room to complain. I leave this to you.")
('Bracer Alvis', "Makes sense to me. We'll back you up!")
('Renne', 'Heehee! Just follow my lead!')
('Odette', 'What the...?!')
('Agnès', 'Renne...?')
('Albert', "She's just on another level...!")
('Aaron', '...Always felt like there was something funky<br/>with her. Mask off now, I guess.')
('Van', "We just gotta roll with it. Let's move!")
('Van', "Risette, connect some dots for me. What do you<br/>think they're gettin' at here?")
('Risette', "To my knowledge, their goal centers around Professor<br/>Callaghan's incomplete energy research.")
('Risette', 'If Almata has reclaimed his work and seeks to<br/>complete it...')
('Risette', "...then their target must be related to that research.<br/>I suspect they want to claim the nucleus of the city's<br/>energy and processing systems.")
('Quatre', 'No...!')
('Van', 'You know where that is, Quatre?')
('Quatre', "The observatory! That was Professor Callaghan's<br/>original research annex!")
('Quatre', "That's where the orbal net's mainframe is<br/>located, too!")
('Feri', 'Really?!')
('Agnès', 'Odette! Did you see that gold airship? Where was<br/>it headed?!')
('Odette', 'Umm, uhh... The Institute of Science, I think! I saw<br/>it flying over that way.')
('Van', 'Bingo.')
('Van', "The city's in your hands. Use your lackeys to make as<br/>much noise as you can to draw their attention.")
('Renne', 'Heehee. But of course.')
('Bracer Alvis', "We're not lackeys, damn it!")
('Feri', "We'll make sure Almata doesn't get their way!")
('Aaron', "Damn straight! This time, we're gonna beat them<br/>within a rege of their lives!")
('Albert', "H-Hold on! You're not going, too, are you, Agnès?!")
('Albert', "Think about the situation! You'll be much safer<br/>with us!")
('Agnès', 'Albert...')
('Agnès', "Don't worry—I'll be fine. I promise, I'll be back soon!")
('Albert', 'Damn it...')
('Odette', "Look at her. She's got one rough path ahead of her,<br/>but there she goes, charging straight forward with a<br/>sprint in her step.")
('Odette', "So let's follow her lead and focus on doing what we<br/>can here!")
('Renne', 'Well said. Communications are still unstable, so I<br/>could use all the help I can getting in touch<br/>with everyone.')
('Renne', "Miss CID Agent, my friends with the guild, Odette,<br/>and Albert. It's time we got started!")

('Aaron', "That's great, grandpa. Now let's get you home.")
('Agnès', 'I-I see... I do hear that the four manufacturers<br/>compete with each other a lot.')
('Agnès', 'That they have their own specialties, but nonetheless<br/>push each other to innovate.')
('Agnès', 'Does that factor into the showroom, too?')
('Van', 'Oh, yeah. These guys are ruthless!')
('Van', "They all specialize in different things, but when<br/>markets collide, you bet they're at each<br/>other's throats. And that's good for the consumer.")
('Van', "Leno and Ingert especially. They both manufacture<br/>their cars here in Basel, so they headhunt and poach<br/>from each other like nobody's business.")

('Pier', "Oh, Willy's! Yes, he was parked here until...oh, ten<br/>minutes ago?")

('Pier', 'My friend, she... She told me one night that she was<br/>having suicidal thoughts. I had to talk her out of it...')
('Agnès', "That's horrible...! Does the institute not know about<br/>their working conditions?")
('Pier', "Oh, they do, but it's fear that rules the roost there.")
('Pier', "The institute's senior professors are like celebrities in<br/>their own right. Nobody can touch them.")

('Van', 'Huh. Outta curiosity, who do you work for?')
('Pier', "This orbal goods supplier. They've got a license from<br/>Verne to sell their goods.")
('Pier', "So it's not like I can speak up about it, because then<br/>there goes MY career. Word travels fast.")
('Van', "Yeah... That tracks. Verne and the institute might as<br/>well BE Basel. You speak up and you're never workin'<br/>in this town again.")

('Researcher Athena', 'Haha...ha... You sound like my coworkers...')
('Researcher Athena', 'So, umm, do you need me to go over the details?')
('Researcher Athena', 'So, umm, do you need me to go over the details?')
('Van', "One minute, actually, just remembered there's<br/>business I gotta take care of. Sorry.")
('Researcher Athena', "Ah. Well, that's okay. Do what you need to do.")
('Researcher Athena', "I'll be here!")
('Van', 'Much obliged.')
('Researcher Athena', "O-Okay. Right this way, I'll, uh... The manager and I<br/>will take you through it.")
('Manager Radad', 'So these kind folks are helping you test it out?')
('Manager Radad', "Nice to meet'cha. Name's Radad—I'm the manager<br/>of the Verne Store.")
('Manager Radad', 'Depending on how these tests go, you might see this<br/>holo core on our shelves soon.')
('Manager Radad', "So I'll be keeping an eye over these field<br/>results myself. You wouldn't mind reporting your<br/>findings to me, too, would you?")
('Risette', 'Not at all.')
('Researcher Athena', "Right, let's go ahead and dive in. So here's how I<br/>want the testing to go...")
('Researcher Athena', 'This new holo is named Pocel.')
('Researcher Athena', "I'd like you to equip her to your Xiphas and take her<br/>into a few monster fights.")
('Van', 'Anything specific you need us to do once we get in<br/>a fight?')
('Researcher Athena', "Mhm. I need you to do five moves or more while<br/>you're S-Boosted.")
('Researcher Athena', "Once you're done, I'd like to hear how it felt to use!")
('Van', 'Sounds easy enough.')
('Researcher Athena', 'One second here... Okay, here you go.')
('System', 'Received the Pocel holo core.')
('Agnès', "Pocel's a cute name! I'm curious to see what kind of<br/>holo it is.")
('Feri', "A brand new holo core straight from the institute...<br/>Oh, man! I can't wait!")
('Researcher Athena', "Well, haha... She's, uh, she's a bit unique.")
('Researcher Athena', "You'll find out more after you equip her.")
('Aaron', 'Now we just gotta find some schmucks and ruin<br/>their day.')
('Aaron', 'But, uhh, now that I think about it, where ARE the<br/>monsters around here?')
('Aaron', 'The road we drove in on was all cleaned out.')
('Manager Radad', "If you're looking for monsters, I'd say the Auge<br/>Canyon to the south is your best bet.")
('Manager Radad', "Once you're off the road and past the orbal lights,<br/>things get a bit dicey...")
('Manager Radad', "...but you guys look pretty seasoned, so you should<br/>be fine. It'll make for a nice little test bed.")
('Van', "Well, fine by me. Let's head on down and give this<br/>new holo core a whirl.")
('Van', 'Oh, right, gotta equip it first. Duh.')
('Risette', "Indeed. Once we've finished our preparations, let's<br/>make for the canyon.")
('Risette', 'We should be able to access it from the road next to<br/>the Verne HQ building.')
('System', 'You can now travel to Auge Canyon.')
('Researcher Athena', "Phew... Now I'll finally be able to get started on<br/>the report.")
('Researcher Athena', 'Just gotta wait for the test results...')
('Van', "Yo! Good timin'. We gave the new holo core a spin.")
('Researcher Athena', 'Eep!')
('Researcher Athena', 'O-Oh! Umm, good work, everyone. Would you mind<br/>sharing your feedback?')
('Van', 'Can do.')
('Researcher Athena', 'Oh, can I have that holo core back first?')
('Van', 'Sure. Here you go.')
('System', 'Returned the Pocel holo core to Athena.')
('Researcher Athena', 'Thank you. Lemme go ahead and start uploading the<br/>combat data.')
('Researcher Athena', 'Juuust a sec... Okay.')
('System', 'Athena connected the holo core to her laptop.')
('Researcher Athena', "So, while it's uploading, how did it feel to use?")
('Researcher Athena', 'Performance, bugs, anything at all.')
('Van', "Well, I don't have much to say about its performance,<br/>being honest. It's more, uh...")
('Van', "I swear, that AI didn't know the difference between a<br/>fight and a playground. The hell's up with her?")
('Agnès', "Aww, don't be so harsh. She had this childlike<br/>whimsy to her! I found it pretty cute.")
('Feri', "It felt really weird... Does she heal people in combat?<br/>That's what it felt like to me, at least.")
('Risette', "A very unique core, indeed. Should it hit the shelves,<br/>I imagine it'll be the talk of the town.")
('Aaron', "I, for one, do not vibe with the idea of carrying a little<br/>girl around in my pocket. And I'm sure any<br/>self-respecting guy wouldn't, either.")
('Aaron', "But I dunno, our resident weirdo already has one of<br/>those—maybe that's what he's into.")
('Van', "Zip it, Aaron—and leave HER out of this! Not like I<br/>picked either of 'em!")
('Agnès', "(That's awfully rude, Van. You'll upset her if she<br/>hears that!)")
('Manager Radad', "Ohh, right... Word through the grapevine is she's an<br/>interesting holo herself.")
('Researcher Athena', 'Oh, you mean Mare...?')
('Risette', "You're familiar with her?")
('Researcher Athena', 'Oh, yeah. The professor told me about her.')
('Researcher Athena', "According to him, she was actually an accident.<br/>That PMC wasn't even trying to make the pinnacle<br/>of all holo cores, but somehow, they just...did.")
('Researcher Athena', "That's why I asked you guys, actually: I knew you had<br/>experience working with cores like her.")
('Van', "Well, that explains the funny feeling I had. So it<br/>wasn't just a coincidence.")
('Van', 'Your professor must be pretty informed if he knows<br/>about Mare-Bear.')
('Risette', "Indeed. Her existence isn't technically confidential,<br/>but she hasn't been promoted or publicized either.")
('Risette', 'I imagine word has reached the inner circles of the<br/>industry—the three disciples, at least.')
('Researcher Athena', 'Yup, that tracks. It was Professor Cronkite who<br/>told me.')
('Researcher Athena', "No wonder he knows. He's pretty much carrying the<br/>Republic's engineering sector on his back.")
('Manager Radad', "I can confirm he's the real deal. Not an engineer<br/>worth their salt who doesn't know about his work.")
('Researcher Athena', "Yeah, haha. He's really leaps and bounds above me.")
('Researcher Athena', 'He can be scary sometimes, but he really knows<br/>his stuff. I learned a ton working under him.')
('Researcher Athena', "Being honest, it was actually him who came up with<br/>Pocel's adaptive AI design. I owe him for that!")
('Risette', 'Is that so? We saw him not long ago...')
('Aaron', 'Hmm... Dude gets his pick of the litter, and he goes<br/>with a little girl. Riiight...')
('Risette', 'I did hear rumors about him...but I can neither<br/>confirm nor deny.')
('Aaron', "Heh! So HE'S the creep on the block!")
('Researcher Athena', "N-No, no! That's not it!")
('Researcher Athena', "The reason Pocel is a girl is because she's meant to<br/>simulate how real humans grow and learn.")
('Researcher Athena', 'So the more she learns, the more she matures.')
('Aaron', "Riiight, THAT'S the reason.")
('Agnès', "Aaron, why don't you grow up, too?")
('Feri', "Does it really learn just like a real person? That's<br/>so cool!")
('Researcher Athena', "She does, yeah...but according to Professor Cronkite,<br/>she doesn't even come close to Mare's inner potential.")
('Researcher Athena', "It's been bugging him lately, actually. He was all, 'If<br/>some security company can make an advanced holo<br/>core, why can't we?'")
('Researcher Athena', "He's been researching holo cores in his spare time to<br/>try and figure it all out.")
('Van', "Hah. Guy's driven, that's for sure.")
('Van', 'So, getting back on topic: the core was fine.')
('Van', "Being a child that hasn't 'learned' much, yeah, her<br/>abilities are pretty basic stuff, but she was pretty easy<br/>to use.")
('Researcher Athena', 'Really? Thank you!')
('Van', 'Only real snag I ran into was it being a bit janky<br/>deploying shards while I was boosting.')
('Van', "It didn't really hamper me at all, but still.")
('Risette', "Compared to other holo cores, Pocel's deep learning<br/>algorithms may increase processing overhead and<br/>delay combat functions.")
('Risette', 'Optimization should be a priority to help mitigate<br/>that—though some latency is probably unavoidable.')
('Researcher Athena', 'Yeah, that does make sense. Can you each give me<br/>your feedback, too?')
('System', "Van's cohorts each offered their impressions<br/>to Athena.")
('System', 'Conveniently, the holo core finished uploading its<br/>combat data to the laptop just as they were<br/>wrapping up.')
('Researcher Athena', 'Thanks for waiting, guys.')
('Researcher Athena', 'Now that I have the data, lemme give you this back.')
('System', 'Received the Pocel holo core—permanently!')
('Van', 'Oh, we can keep her?')
('Researcher Athena', 'Mhm. I just wanted to thank you for helping test her.')
('Researcher Athena', "We'll be pushing updates once we iron out the kinks,<br/>so she should get better with time.")
('Researcher Athena', 'Thank you so much for your help!')
('Researcher Athena', 'Now, I need to get on back to the institute and<br/>analyze this data.')
('Van', 'Sounds good. Take care!')
('System', 'Quest A New Holo Core completed!')
('System', 'Received')
('Chamberlain', "...All right, I think I got'cha. So you want a venue for<br/>your RC race?")
('Quatre', 'Yes. The pavilion has hosted RC races in the past, if<br/>memory serves.')
('Quatre', 'Would you be willing to lend us an event space for a<br/>race of our own?')
('Petra', "Ahh, now it's making sense.")
('Petra', "Well, how could I refuse a request from you, Quatre?<br/>I'll talk to the administrator and see what I can do.")
('Petra', "Our schedule's pretty quiet right now, so they<br/>shouldn't have a problem with it.")
('Chamberlain', "Let's make this the best race you've ever seen!")
('Millia', 'Yay! Thank goodness!')
('Dick', "Now I REALLY can't wait!")
('Van', "Huh. Didn't think you had inroads with the pavilion.")
('Van', "Nice job callin' in those IOUs, Quatre.")
('Quatre', 'They do come in handy. I should specify, though, this<br/>is more for me.')
('Quatre', "The pavilion works closely with the institute and the<br/>workshop, so we're well acquainted.")
('Petra', 'Out of curiosity, what kinds of RC cars are<br/>you bringing?')
('Dick', "I'll be using my Leno Land Carrier!")
('Millia', "And I've got an Ingert Nightbreaker pickup.")
('Petra', 'Oh, wow!')
('Chamberlain', 'Leno and Ingert?! Seriously?!')
('Quatre', "Wha...? Is that a problem? What's with the alarm?")
('Petra', 'You know those makes, right?')
('Petra', "I'm a Leno employee who has loved this company for<br/>20 years!")
('Chamberlain', "I'm an Ingert employee, and a fanatic in my<br/>own right.")
('Chamberlain', "And Petra and I get a little spirited when we debate<br/>over the two. We'll have a drink and some snacks and<br/>just go to town.")
('Chamberlain', 'If this is a battle between Leno and Ingert, then we<br/>have to treat this seriously.')
('Petra', "You bet. This is company pride we're talking!")
('Van', 'Oh, yeah. This race has big implications, way beyond<br/>just RC stuff.')
('Van', "It's two bitter rivals goin' at it—and for these<br/>young'uns, that can make or break their<br/>brand allegiances. It's serious sh...stuff!")
('Agnès', "That sounds a bit...extreme. I really don't think it's<br/>quite that important...")
('Bracer Alvis', "...Yeah, they've lost me.")
('Chamberlain', 'Oh, I have an idea.')
('Chamberlain', "We have some aftermarket parts over in<br/>the storehouse. I'll let you two have a sneak peek—<br/>on me. Don't tell anybody, okay?")
('Petra', "Oh, would you mind giving us some time to work out<br/>the track? We want to make sure it's perfect as<br/>can be.")
('Dick', 'Sure!')
('Millia', 'By all means!')
('Van', 'Yeah. Thanks a lot.')
('System', 'A few minutes later...')
('Chamberlain', "I'll go over the rules one more time, just to be safe.")
('Chamberlain', 'Team Dick and Team Millia will compete in a<br/>two-on-two relay format.')
('Chamberlain', 'After two laps, the first racer will hand the controls to<br/>the second. They will complete two more laps, for<br/>four total.')
('Chamberlain', 'The finish line will be right here at the start.<br/>Understood?')
('Risette', 'So, Dick and Millia will lead off their<br/>respective teams.')
('Quatre', 'Yeah. Then Van and Alvis will compete against each<br/>other in the second leg.')
('Feri', "I'm getting really excited! Who's gonna win?")
('Chamberlain', 'Racers, on your marks...')
('Chamberlain', 'Get set... GO!')
('Van', "Man, they're really fired up.")
('Bracer Alvis', "You said it. I'm glad they're having fun.")
('Bracer Alvis', "...Wait, why am I being all buddy-buddy with you?<br/>We're not allies anymore—we're ENEMIES!")
('Van', 'Sure, sure.')
('System', 'With that, the race was off to a thrilling start.')
('System', 'Millia climbed out to an early lead with<br/>her Nightbreaker...')
('System', "...but after negotiating the turns, Dick's Land Carrier<br/>began to catch up down the long straight.")
('System', 'He had swapped out its stock motor for an<br/>aftermarket sport engine boasting much<br/>stronger acceleration.')
('System', 'The track favored straight-line speed with its series of<br/>straightaways, allowing Dick to pull ahead of Millia<br/>after the first lap.')
('System', 'Not to count Millia out—she closed the gap in the<br/>corners with her skillful driving.')
('System', "She had cut the deficit, but she still lagged behind<br/>Dick's souped-up machine as their leg of the race<br/>came to a close.")
('Dick', "I'm leading, Alvis! I did it!")
('Bracer Alvis', 'You sure did! Leave the rest to me, buddy!')
('Millia', 'Dang it! You win this round, Dick!')
('Millia', "Go get 'em, Van!")
('Van', 'You got it. Gave me some nice momentum to<br/>work with!')
('System', 'With the third lap underway, Van and Alvis tested<br/>their mettle.')
('Bracer Alvis', "I should've expected as much from a Leno employee's<br/>special customization. They really understand this<br/>thing's unique qualities.")
('Van', 'Same here.')
('Van', "But neither side has a clear advantage... There's no<br/>ace in the hole.")
('Bracer Alvis', 'What the—?!')
('Petra', 'Heh heh! Sorry to interrupt!')
('Petra', "Both of these cars are designed to go off-road, so<br/>what's the point in keeping them ON the road?")
('Chamberlain', 'Paved roads are hardly their natural habitat, so we<br/>decided to spice up the track a bit.')
('Chamberlain', 'This puts every facet of your cars to the test!')
('Van', "Oh, that's rad. You guys know how to put on a race!")
('Dick', "Wooow, that's so cool!")
('Millia', "Man, I wish I could've raced on this... I wonder how<br/>I'd have done?")
('Bracer Alvis', 'Okay, built up a little lead here. Gotta protect that,<br/>no mistakes.')
('Van', 'Hmm... How do I wanna go about this?')
('Van', "(That cardboard's a big ol' roadblock, but I'm<br/>already behind.)")
('Van', "(What's the play here?)")
('Van', 'No time to lose! Full throttle, baby!')
('Van', "Oh, yeah! How's that?!")
('Bracer Alvis', 'Hah, not bad!')
('Van', "I can't risk a flip here...!")
('Bracer Alvis', "Hah! You drive like my mom. You won't close the<br/>gap like that!")
('Bracer Alvis', 'Got the off-road bit coming up next.')
('Van', 'Heh. This is gonna be good.')
('Bracer Alvis', 'LCs chew these roads for breakfast!')
('Van', "I can't push my grip on this surface, but I can't afford<br/>to give up any ground either...")
('Van', 'Do I hold steady, or do I punch it?')
('Van', 'Gotta be patient here.')
('Bracer Alvis', "Grr... I just can't shake him!")
('Van', "He pulls away here and I'm done!")
('Van', 'Gah, shoot...!')
('Bracer Alvis', 'Heh! You sweating there, spriggan? On the ropes?')
('Van', "(Last big curve comin' up. The inside line is less<br/>distance, but he's gonna want it, too...)")
('Van', "I'll take that inside line, thank you!")
('Bracer Alvis', "Oh, no, you don't! That corner's mine!")
('Van', "Got'cha, bitch!")
('Bracer Alvis', 'You little...!')
('Van', "Tch. He's good—got the bottom covered up. In that<br/>case...!")
('Van', 'You want the inside line? Fine, take it.')
('Bracer Alvis', "What, you trying to get a run on the outside? Bit late<br/>for that—I've got the finish line right there waiting<br/>for me!")
('Van', "I've got one last ace up my sleeve. Get a load of my<br/>TWIN TURBO!")
('Bracer Alvis', "What the—?! How'd you get that? Is that<br/>even allowed?!")
('Van', 'Yooo, this is sick! Wonder if I can get one of these<br/>for my truck?')
('Van', "Don't you whine to me about the rules.<br/>Anything goes, right?!")
('Millia', "Huh?! I've never seen a part like that!")
('Agnès', "Wow, he's really proud of that.")
('Quatre', "He was off chatting with Chamberlain about<br/>something earlier... I suppose that's what it was.")
('Aaron', 'You were sitting on that one for a while, huh?')
('Bracer Alvis', 'But...how?! I swapped the motor and everything...!')
('Van', "You're mine!")
('Bracer Alvis', 'I win!')
('Chamberlain', 'All four of you really put on a show there...')
('Chamberlain', '...but in the end, only one team can be the winner.')
('Petra', 'On with the results!')
('Petra', 'Leno vs Ingert. The winner of this white hot relay<br/>RC race is...')
('Petra', '...the Ingert team, led by Captain Millia!')
('Millia', 'Wow...! We really did it!')
('Millia', 'They had us there, but you outdrove them in the<br/>second half! Way to go!')
('Van', "It was nothin'. Thanks for lettin' me tear up<br/>the course with your Nightbreaker.")
('Bracer Alvis', 'I hate to admit it, but you have me beat.')
('Bracer Alvis', 'Maybe I owe you some respect as a gearhead. Maybe.')
('Dick', "Man, you're a really good driver, Alvis. I wanna learn<br/>how you race like that.")
('Dick', 'But I am NOT losing to you again, Millia! Best two<br/>out of three!')
('Millia', "Heh heh... You're on!")
('Petra', '...the Leno team, led by Captain Dick!')
('Dick', 'We... We did it! We actually beat her!')
('Dick', "Thank you so much, Alvis! You're an amazing driver!")
('Bracer Alvis', "Hey, it wasn't all me, buddy. You did pretty<br/>good yourself!")
('Van', "Phew... Well, I gave 'er my best shot. I had plenty of<br/>fun, though.")
('Millia', "Me, too! I've never been that pumped up for a race<br/>before—and I learned a lot from how you drive!")
('Millia', 'But I wanna race you again, Dick! One on one!')
('Dick', "What's that? You wanna lose again? Well, sure!")
('Quatre', "Well, that was quite the show. I wasn't expecting to<br/>end up so invested.")
('Van', "Yeah, but I think we've hogged the pavilion long<br/>enough with that. Let's bounce.")
('Bracer Alvis', 'Yeah. I should get back to my rounds.')
('Dick', "Okay. Let's head back to the Artisanal District and<br/>race there!")
('Millia', 'Yeah, good idea!')
('Agnès', "Well, I'm glad they've mended things!")
('Feri', "It's like that big fight from before never happened.")
('Bracer Alvis', "Haha. That ballooned a bit, didn't it? But hey, all's<br/>well that ends well.")
('Van', 'I really owe you guys for that.')
('Chamberlain', "That's our line! How could we say no to a race<br/>between two of the auto industry's biggest rivals?")
('Petra', "Orbal cars aren't just machines: they're the future!<br/>They're something that kids and adults both<br/>can appreciate!")
('Petra', 'That race was exactly what the motor pavilion is all<br/>about: spreading the joys of motoring to all!')
('Chamberlain', 'Come on back some time, will ya?')
('System', 'The grand prix may have ended, but Dick and Millia<br/>still hungered for racing. Van and company saw them<br/>back to the Artisanal District...')
('System', '...and then made for the institute.')
('System', 'Quest RC Car Showdown completed!')
('System', 'Received')
('System', 'Earned')
('Risette', "It looks like they've already made their move.")
('Van', 'Looks like it...')
('Van', 'So...now what?')
('System', "HQ to spriggan. We've found new traces of<br/>the hacker.")
('System', "Disregard the kitty for now. Your target is 'Z-Cat #1.'")
('Feri', "Z...cat? One? I don't get it.")
('Van', "Well, they said to 'disregard the kitty,' so...")
('Aaron', "Disregard the... Oh, THAT'S what it is.")
('Risette', 'It might help to write it out on paper.')
('Feri', "Would it really? I don't see how...")
('Aaron', "This one would've been too much for the<br/>small fry's brain. How cruel.")
('Van', 'I got a pretty good idea of where the objective is—I<br/>can see it on that sign over there.')
('Van', "Let's head on over and take a look.")
('Van', '(A cat, huh...? But what do cats have to do with the<br/>orbal ne... Ohh, HER.)')
('Van', 'Annnnnd here we are.')
('Van', 'Z-Cat #1 minus the cat: a Z1 racecar.')
('Feri', 'Ohh, I get it!')
('Feri', "Take the 'cat' out of 'Z-Cat #1' and you get Z1!")
('Aaron', "So you just cut the 'cat,' huh? Almost too easy.")
('Risette', 'Our next message should be arriving shortly.')
('Van', 'Yup. Stay sharp, gang.')
('James', '...Well, that was anticlimactic.')
('James', 'Lessee here...')
('James', 'Hmm...')
('Van', 'Yo. You in the game, too?')
('James', "Yeah, guess so. Didn't know there were other people<br/>doin' this.")
('System', 'HQ to spriggan. The hacker got away.')
('System', "But their tracks are fresh—they should still be nearby.<br/>Head for coordinate marker '■WX-□BC' '■-□'.")
('James', "...Well, what the hell is this? Doesn't make a lick<br/>of sense.")
('James', "But I really don't wanna lose to these guys...<br/>Gotta think this one over.")
('James', "Well, I'm headin' out. Catch ya later.")
('Van', 'Have fun. Best of luck out there.')
('Feri', "Let's try and figure this one out!")
('Aaron', "Puzzling time. Let's start with the easiest stuff first.")
('Risette', 'I suspect that we need to fill in the square marks<br/>with letters.')
('Risette', 'Once we complete the sequence, the phrase will<br/>come together.')
('Van', 'Yeah. And once we have the full phrase, the rest is a<br/>cakewalk from there.')
('Van', "Let's follow the code and see what we find.")
('Van', "So... First floor's Verne Arms, second is<br/>Verne Store...")
('Van', 'And the building itself is Verne Plaza...')
('Van', 'Verne Arms... Or V-A. That lines up with the code.')
('Feri', 'Ugh, this is making my head spin!')
('Risette', 'We did crack this code quickly. That bodes well<br/>for us.')
('Aaron', "It's not too hard if you know your way around.")
('Risette', 'We made good time on this puzzle, from the looks<br/>of it.')
('Van', 'Oho. Would you look at that: another message.')
('System', 'PS: From the engineer, a pair of ZCF goggles will<br/>spell your way.')
('Risette', 'ZCF goggles can be found at the Verne Store, if<br/>memory serves.')
('Feri', "Didn't ZCF come up earlier...?")
('Aaron', "We heard about 'em earlier, didn't we?")
('Risette', "Yes. ZCF is the Liberl Kingdom's principal<br/>engineering company. They were notable for building<br/>the first orbal airships.")
('Van', "So now we got Liberlian goods in the picture...<br/>That really makes me think it's her.")
('Van', "Anyhow, let's go get those goggles.")
('Van', 'Heya, quick question: you guys stock ZCF goggles?')
('Engineer Carter', "We sure do. Here's a pair for ya.")
('System', 'Obtained <br/>.')
('Risette', "They will 'spell your way,' the riddle said... Is there<br/>writing on them? I don't see anything on the<br/>frame, so... Oh, the lens, perhaps?")
('Feri', 'Oh! I see the words!')
('Aaron', 'Bingo. Check this shit.')
('System', 'Await the aerotram—the bench will beckon.')
('Van', 'Guess we just gotta follow the breadcrumbs now.')
('Risette', 'The aerotram is just up the stairs.')
('Risette', 'Let us make haste.')
('James', "V-A, V-A... They don't mean Verne Arms, do they?<br/>What else could it be...?")
('James', "Rrrgh! I hate this puzzle shit. I don't get these riddles<br/>at all...")
('Van', "Ooh, looks like we're a step ahead this time.")
('Feri', 'We did it! Now all we have to do is head for<br/>the bench!')
('Aaron', "Let's hurry—can't let the kid show us up.")
('Van', 'Roger, roger.')
('Van', "Well, if it ain't the Student Council prez. Figured you<br/>had a hand in this.")
('Renne', 'Teehee. You caught me. Good evening, spriggan.')
('Feri', 'Wha—?! Renne, why are you here?')
('Renne', "Heehee. I'm glad I at least caught someone by<br/>surprise—it's more fun that way.")
('Aaron', 'So Little Miss Violet was behind it all, huh?<br/>Feels oddly appropriate.')
('Renne', "I'm flattered to hear that from Langport's own<br/>little prodigy.")
('Van', "So how'd you get roped in to all this?")
('Renne', 'Well, I happen to know the game master through the<br/>net, you see.')
('Renne', "He'd been putting out all these fascinating<br/>riddles online. I figured I might as well reach out<br/>to him.")
('Renne', 'We got in touch and eventually came up with the<br/>idea of this game.')
('Renne', 'And what better setting for a cyber-themed story<br/>than Basel?')
('Renne', "I even got to try out this new mail API that I'd been<br/>tinkering with. I learned quite a lot from this<br/>little exercise!")
('Van', 'Do you just know everyone ever? Geez.')
('Risette', "I did learn about your hacking exploits as Kitty<br/>through MK's database.")
('Risette', "But I didn't realize your talent spanned far more than<br/>just security.")
('Renne', 'Heehee! Thank you. I still have much to learn,<br/>of course.')
('Feri', 'Oh, there he is now!')
('Aaron', 'Took him long enough.')
('James', 'Tch... Musta fell behind somewhere.')
('James', 'Huh... I was wondering why you were here.')
('James', "This was just an excuse to work with that Percy guy,<br/>wasn't it?")
('James', 'Tch... This is all just stupid. The Council President<br/>broke our own curfew for this shit?')
('Renne', "Oh, don't single me out, you meanie.")
('Renne', 'I just so happened to hear from someone about a<br/>bored-looking Aramis student wandering around the<br/>city past curfew...')
('Renne', 'Imagine my shock upon learning it was none other<br/>than you!')
('Renne', 'So, James, did you have fun being a naughty<br/>little boy?')
('James', "Hmph. Barely felt a thing. All that effort for a dud of<br/>a 'game.'")
('Van', "Oh? Coulda sworn I heard you rackin' your brain a bit<br/>at some of those riddles, there.")
('James', 'That...! I mean, er...')
('James', '...Okay, fine. They DID make me think a little.<br/>Kinda.')
('Renne', "That's excellent news! I'm sure he'll be happy to<br/>hear it.")
('James', 'Wait, so did you really make that auto-send API<br/>thing for the emails? Like, you made that<br/>from scratch?')
('James', "How the hell are you even real...? No wonder Ronald<br/>and I don't measure up.")
('James', "...Welp. Fine, I admit it. You're pretty damn good.")
('Renne', 'Aww, thanks. But flattery will get you<br/>nowhere, mister.')
('Renne', 'Oh, and would you mind keeping tonight our<br/>little secret?')
('Renne', "I'm not sure what I'd say if, as you mentioned,<br/>everyone found out I was breaking my own rules.")
('James', 'Sure, sure. Just as long as you keep ME a secret, too.')
('Risette', "I'm not privy to the specifics here, but it looks like<br/>they've worked things out.")
('Van', "Yeah. Just kids bein' kids.")
('Van', "(Ronald, eh? So he's the other brain cell in<br/>James' group.)")
('Van', "(At least things've settled down now.)")
('System', 'Percy shortly arrived on the scene, and the<br/>participants gave him their impressions of the game.')
('Percy', 'Well! Good work, everyone! And thank you for the<br/>rave reviews.')
('Percy', "I owe a special shoutout to Renne—without her,<br/>none of this would've been possible.")
('Renne', 'Oh, think nothing of it. Thank YOU for having me.')
('Renne', 'If you ever get the idea for some other game, do let<br/>me know.')
('Percy', 'Haha, you got it. Thanks a bunch.')
('Percy', "Man, I never thought my online friend would be<br/>a high-schooler. You're really something special.")
('Percy', 'I mean, how the heck did you learn so much about<br/>the orbal net at your age?')
('Percy', "I feel like you're gonna leave me behind if I'm<br/>not careful. I gotta branch out and level up my<br/>programming skills!")
('Van', "Best of luck with that, pal. Gotta say, this was all<br/>pretty fun, so I'd be down to try whatever you come<br/>up with next.")
('Percy', 'Thank you! I still have a lot of kinks to iron out,<br/>for sure.')
('Percy', "But I might be able to go public soon! It's almost<br/>ready for average Joes and Janes, I think.")
('Percy', "Now, here's a little prize for you guys, since you got<br/>here first and all.")
('Percy', 'Again, thank you so much for participating.<br/>Look forward to the next game!')
('System', 'With the game wrapped up, Percy excused himself to<br/>mull over his feedback...')
('System', '...and Renne and James snuck back into the hotel for<br/>the night.')
('System', 'Quest QA Testing―Again! completed!')
('System', 'Received')
('Van', 'Yo. Harrison, right? Van Arkride, Arkride Solutions.')
('Van', 'You got a 4SPG for us?')
('Harrison', 'Oh, thank the Goddess! I could really use your help.')
('Quatre', 'How so? Could you fill us in on the details?')
('Quatre', "You're from Verne's weapons development<br/>division, right?")
('Harrison', "That's right, I... Wait a minute. Are you...<br/>Quatre Salision?!")
('Harrison', 'H-Hold on, why is he here?! Did I not specify that<br/>this was to be kept secret from the institute?')
('Risette', 'Your request asked for secrecy from Verne employees,<br/>and not Institute of Science personnel.')
('Van', "And anyway, Quatre here ain't a researcher today—<br/>he's workin' with me, for reasons.")
('Van', "We won't know how to help you if you don't tell us<br/>what the problem is.")
('Agnès', "(I feel like this might be related to Professor<br/>Callaghan's situation...)")
('Harrison', 'Mmgh... All right, all right.')
('Harrison', 'But please, PLEASE keep this under wraps! If CEO<br/>Tausend hears about this, I... Oh, Goddess, help me!')
('Quatre', "I can't promise that—it depends on the severity of<br/>your situation.")
('Quatre', "But I can promise that I'll hear you out before making<br/>any moves.")
('Quatre', 'Regaining that classified info is in our best interests,<br/>at any rate.')
('Quatre', "Anything beyond that, well... That's the<br/>spriggan's jurisdiction.")
('Aaron', "Well, ain't the kid awfully bossy?")
('Harrison', 'Fine... I can work with that.')
('Harrison', 'Just let me explain myself in full, please—and<br/>preferably in private.')
('Harrison', "So, umm...well, there's no good way I can phrase this.")
('Harrison', 'I-I got caught in a honey trap.')
('Feri', "Oh, I've heard of those...")
('Agnès', 'They crop up a lot in books and films... I guess life<br/>really does imitate art.')
('Aaron', "Well, way I see it, that ain't really a problem on<br/>its own. She leave you blue balled and bankrupt<br/>or what?")
('Harrison', 'W-Well... Erm...')
('Van', "Stop beatin' around the bush. The more we know, the<br/>sooner we can get crackin'.")
('Harrison', 'I know, I... Ugh...')
('Harrison', 'It was late last night. I had just gotten off my shift<br/>at work.')
('Harrison', 'I had with me that briefcase with the classified<br/>documents in it, as discussed earlier.')
('Harrison', 'And that was when I bumped into her. A hostess.')
('Harrison', 'She said she fell out with a regular customer she was<br/>fond of... She looked awful.')
('Harrison', 'But then one thing led to another and we...well, we<br/>drank together at Hotel Ingress.')
('Aaron', "Yeah? Yeah? And what did that 'lead to'?<br/>Spit something more at us, why don't you?")
('Harrison', "Th-That's enough! Do I really need to go into<br/>more detail?!")
('Quatre', "Down, Aaron. Your snide little quips aren't helping.")
('Quatre', 'So, what happened afterward?')
('Harrison', "I, umm... A-Ahem! I don't remember, honestly.")
('Harrison', "I couldn't keep my eyes open. When I came to, it was<br/>already the next morning.")
('Harrison', "By then, she was long gone, and she'd taken the<br/>briefcase with her. I... I panicked.")
('Harrison', 'I heard about 4SPG requests, so I sent one in to try<br/>and save face.')
('Van', '...Huh.')
('Quatre', 'Bringing classified materials to a romantic tryst is...<br/>rash, to say the least.')
('Harrison', 'I know, I know... Just, with security clearance and all,<br/>I figured it would be safe.')
('Risette', 'Indeed. The security card system has made outside<br/>attempts at data breaches difficult.')
('Risette', 'Perhaps that was what led them to target an insider<br/>like yourself.')
('Harrison', "S-So...you'll take it? You'll take it, right?")
('Harrison', 'We have to act fast, or that briefcase is as good<br/>as gone!')
('Agnès', 'What should we do, Van?')
('Harrison', 'It had to have been that hostess—I know she stole<br/>the briefcase!')
('Harrison', 'And the more time we waste, the slimmer our odds of<br/>getting it back!')
('Harrison', "I'm begging you, please!")
('Agnès', 'What should we do?')
('Van', "We'll take the job, but there's some other business we<br/>gotta wrap up first.")
('Van', 'Be back in a bit, okay?')
('Harrison', 'Wait, what...?!')
('Harrison', 'I... F-Fine, but please hurry!')
('Van', "All right, we'll take it.")
('Harrison', 'Phew... Thank you so much! I can finally see the light<br/>at the end of the tunnel...!')
('Quatre', "Thank you, Van. I can't overlook this myself.")
('Agnès', 'So, just to make sure...')
('Agnès', 'Have you contacted the hotel and asked if they still<br/>have it?')
('Agnès', 'You might have just left it at the bar or elsewhere.<br/>They have a lost and found for those sorts of things,<br/>I believe.')
('Harrison', "Actually, that's a good point. I was so panicked that I<br/>just assumed it was stolen.")
('Van', "Let's hit up the hotel first, then.")
('Van', 'If they have it, case closed. Might not even charge<br/>you for that one.')
('Van', "But if it WAS stolen, then we're on the case.")
('Harrison', "Right, that's fine by me. Thank you so much!")
('Receptionist Freyd', "I'm sorry, but we don't have anything of<br/>that description.")
('Receptionist Freyd', "We ask our guests to return any missing items they've<br/>found, but we haven't seen nor heard of a briefcase.")
('Receptionist Freyd', 'Housekeeping has cleaned your room already...')
('Receptionist Freyd', "...but they didn't find anything there, either.")
('Harrison', 'Well...great.')
('Agnès', 'It does sound like it was stolen, then—and that brings<br/>us to our mystery woman.')
('Van', 'By the by...')
('Van', "Did you happen to see a hostess or hostess-esque<br/>woman leavin' the hotel yesterday morning?")
('Receptionist Freyd', 'A hostess...? No, not that I can recall.')
('Risette', 'I see... Very odd.')
('Feri', 'So, where could she have gone in that time?')
('Van', 'Anybody in general leave around that time, then?')
('Receptionist Freyd', 'Hmm... Ah, yes, actually.')
('Receptionist Freyd', 'There was a researcher who rushed out of the hotel<br/>that morning. She looked like she was in a hurry.')
('Receptionist Freyd', 'And did she...? Yeah, I think she did. She might have<br/>had a case with her.')
('Harrison', 'A...researcher?!')
('Harrison', 'You know, now that I think about it, she was<br/>really sharp! She knew far more about engineering<br/>than the layman should.')
('Harrison', 'I had been talking to her about my job, and she was<br/>asking me really in-depth questions about the tech I<br/>brought up.')
('Aaron', "Well, sounds like her hostess gig's BS, then. And the<br/>scientist act, too.")
('Van', 'Yeah. She knows more than she lets on...')
('Van', 'That puts the honey trap theory back on the table.')
('Van', "And THAT means the hunt is on. We'll handle the<br/>investigation from here—I think we've got enough to<br/>go on now.")
('Harrison', 'Right, right. Thank you ever so much!')
('Agnès', 'So we have a general idea of who the suspect is...<br/>Now, how do we find her?')
('Aaron', "Process of elimination, I'm thinking. We can try to<br/>figure out where she COULDN'T be.")
('Van', "Let's go over the briefcase before that.")
('Van', 'First step here would be figuring out a motive: what<br/>was in there, and why was she after it?')
('Quatre', "That's...classified info, as I'm sure I don't need to<br/>remind you.")
('Quatre', 'But, well...yeah. We do need to know. Van, can I<br/>trust you?')
('Van', 'Trust is everything in this line of work. Your secrets<br/>are safe with us, promise.')
('Quatre', 'All right. Harrison, if you would fill us in.')
('Harrison', 'Okay, fine...')
('Harrison', "So...they're blueprints for a new orbal gun. Plus some<br/>other design documents.")
('Harrison', "The military is planning to adopt them soon—we've<br/>been getting our parts and assembly pipelines ready.")
('Agnès', 'If those design docs were to fall into foreign hands...')
('Quatre', 'Yes, that would be a problem. It does explain why its<br/>contents were so highly classified.')
('Harrison', "Well, uh... H-Hopefully it doesn't come to that.<br/>But if they do get the docs, making the actual gun<br/>wouldn't be so easy.")
('Harrison', 'It uses some very rare, very complicated metal alloys.')
('Harrison', "And as far as I'm aware, only Basel has the<br/>custom-made machining tools required to work<br/>with them.")
('Quatre', 'You said the thief was well versed with engineering...<br/>She might realize she needs those alloys once she<br/>starts reading the documents.')
('Quatre', 'Could she still be in the city, then, trying to procure<br/>some alloys for herself?')
('Harrison', "You can't just work with them by hand. The alloys are<br/>useless without those special tools.")
('Harrison', "And you can't buy them from the Verne Store unless<br/>you show them your certification card.")
('Harrison', "So even if she knew she needed the alloys, she<br/>shouldn't be able to use them...")
('Feri', "Umm... She didn't steal your certification card, too,<br/>did she?")
('Harrison', "Sh-She shouldn't have. I mean, I... Oh, no.")
('System', 'Harrison frantically searched his pockets, but his<br/>certification card was absent.')
('Harrison', 'A-Are you kidding me...? Not my certification<br/>card, too...')
('Feri', 'Oh, no...')
('Aaron', 'Yeeeah, figured as much. She already had you<br/>wrapped around her finger.')
('Van', "Bet'cha she went to the Verne Store with it.<br/>Let's head over there and ask around.")
('Van', "You just sit tight till we've finished our investigation.<br/>We'll keep you posted.")
('Harrison', 'O-Okay... Good luck!')
('Manager Radad', 'Welcome, wel... Ah, always good to see<br/>institute folks. What can I do you for?')
('Quatre', 'Yes, hello. We have a question.')
('Quatre', 'So, er... Did a female researcher come by the store<br/>this morning?')
('Manager Radad', 'Yeah, somebody came by earlier today. Looked like a<br/>researcher to me.')
('Manager Radad', 'She was a real looker, I remember that much.<br/>She dropped by right after we opened.')
('Agnès', 'I see...! Did she buy anything?')
('Manager Radad', 'She did, yeah. She asked for some alloy<br/>machining tools. It was a bit of a strange ask...')
('Manager Radad', '...but she had her certification card on her, so yeah.<br/>I went ahead and got those for her.')
('Manager Radad', 'She also asked where she could get the<br/>alloys themselves. Maybe she needed them for a<br/>project or something?')
('Manager Radad', "Anyway, I told her they might be able to help her<br/>over at Giscard's.")
('Aaron', "So that's where our little fox ran off to.")
('Risette', "We'd best hurry.")
('Van', 'Thanks for the info!')
('Van', "Hop in, gang. We're takin' the truck.")
('Quatre', "We need to catch her before it's too late!")
('Harrison', 'Yes, this all looks right...!')
('Harrison', "Thank the Goddess, it's all still here! Thank you so<br/>much for getting the briefcase back!")
('Agnès', "That's a relief... Is this case closed, then?")
('Harrison', 'Well, no... It looks like they broke into it.')
('Harrison', 'She knew to procure the right alloys and their tools...<br/>so I think she probably got to read the documents.')
('Risette', 'The information itself has likely reached Zecht<br/>Arms already.')
('Risette', "How they plan to utilize said information, I'm<br/>not sure...")
('Risette', '...but simply having Republic schematics will give<br/>them an advantage in their own research<br/>and development.')
('Harrison', 'This is bad... Really bad! There has to be something<br/>we can do to stop that, but what...?!')
('Van', "There's another card we can play, but you might not<br/>like it.")
('Van', "We can bring in some groups to help us out—but<br/>then, well, they'll know.")
('Quatre', 'This matter concerns more than just you, now—there<br/>are far-reaching industrial secrets at stake.')
('Quatre', 'It would be in your best interest to swallow your pride<br/>and consult the authorities.')
('Harrison', 'Hmm...')
('Harrison', 'A-All right... Fine, the company can know.')
('Harrison', "What's your plan?")
('Van', 'Well...')
('Van', '(If we wanna stay on good terms with the boys<br/>in blue...)')
('Van', "(...then we should probably bring this to Verne and<br/>let 'em work with the police themselves.)")
('Van', "(Whole thing'll be blown wide open at that point, but<br/>the client made his bed there. That'll at least stop the<br/>intel from spreading.)")
('Van', '(OR...we can call some friends in other places.)')
('Van', "(We hit up the second lieutenant and the CID'll have<br/>this snuffed out in no time.)")
('Van', "(I think they'll be happy with an industrial spy as<br/>down payment.)")
('Van', "So how 'bout we get in touch with Verne?")
('Van', "We can loop in the police, too—have 'em investigate<br/>the info leak.")
('Agnès', 'I think that would be the safest route, yeah.')
('Quatre', "Agreed. You're fine with that, Harrison?")
('Harrison', "...Yeah. I don't really have a choice. I need to bite the<br/>bullet and confess.")
('Van', "All right. Let's get 'er done.")
('Van', 'Risette, can you patch us through to Verne?')
('Risette', 'Certainly.')
('Female Researcher?', "...Hmph. Have it your way. This'll make things easier<br/>for the client down the line, anyway.")
('Aaron', "If you make it BACK to your client. Wonder how<br/>long you're gonna be in the clink?")
('System', 'Verne security quickly arrived on the scene.')
('System', 'The spy was apprehended and taken to the police<br/>headquarters, where police interrogated her for<br/>her actions.')
('System', "The party's client did face a stiff reprimand for his<br/>lapse in judgment, but the contents of the briefcase<br/>were nevertheless secure.")
('System', 'Ultimately, it could have been a lot worse<br/>for Harrison.')
('Harrison', "Seriously, I can't thank you guys enough.<br/>Without your help, that briefcase would've done some<br/>serious damage in the wild.")
('Harrison', "I wish I didn't have to confess, but that was just the<br/>way it had to be.")
('Van', "Yeah. Sucks that we couldn't honor the original<br/>request, but eh.")
('Quatre', "I'll make sure the company doesn't punish you<br/>too harshly. Circumstances notwithstanding, it was<br/>an honest mistake.")
('Quatre', 'And it was good that you requested his help—<br/>otherwise, this could have ended up much worse.')
('Harrison', 'Much obliged, haha.')
('Harrison', "I have to excuse myself now. They're questioning<br/>me next.")
('Agnès', 'Good luck.')
('Van', "Let's give the CID a call.")
('Van', 'The second lieutenant just so happens to be in<br/>the area. She should be able to cover it.')
('Quatre', "The CID...? Why go all the way up to them?<br/>Wouldn't the police be better suited for<br/>local investigations?")
('Van', "Nah. The police can't do much about the big picture.<br/>This'll really throw a wrench in her plans.")
('Van', 'For better or worse, the police stick to the letter of<br/>the law.')
('Van', "The CID? They don't really answer to anything.<br/>Justice is blind, but they've got eyes everywhere.")
('Van', "Zecht Arms as a whole ain't goin' anywhere once<br/>they're done with this perp.")
('Agnès', 'I see...')
('Female Researcher?', 'Tch...')
('Quatre', "Well, that should be fine, then. We'll contact the<br/>CID, if it's all the same to you.")
('Harrison', "...Yeah. I don't really have a choice. I need to bite the<br/>bullet and confess.")
('Van', "Then it's settled. Risette, can you call up the CID?")
('Risette', 'Certainly.')
('System', 'Before long, Second Lieutenant Kaela and her CID<br/>accompaniment arrived at the scene.')
('System', 'The spy was taken into CID custody, followed shortly<br/>by cutthroat negotiations with Zecht Arms.')
('System', 'The client did ultimately confess to his error.')
('System', 'However, because he nonetheless helped the CID<br/>apprehend the spy...')
('System', '...they conveniently expunged his name from their<br/>report to the Verne Company.')
('Harrison', "Seriously, I can't thank you guys enough.<br/>Without your help, that briefcase would've done some<br/>serious damage in the wild.")
('Harrison', "I think it's probably for the best that we consulted the<br/>CID, as much as I didn't want to.")
('Van', "Yeah. Sucks that we couldn't honor the original<br/>request, but eh.")
('Van', 'Now we got brownie points with the CID, and you<br/>still got a clean sheet.')
('Harrison', 'Haha... Yeah.')
('Harrison', "I feel a bit guilty getting off scot-free, but...well, I<br/>can't complain about that, can I? Thank you for<br/>concocting such an airtight plan.")
('Harrison', "I need to excuse myself for a minute now. They'd like<br/>to question me.")
('Agnès', 'Best of luck.')
('System', 'Quest Info Leak completed!')
('System', 'Received')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', '...Ah. So you checked the bulletin board, did you?')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "Me, writing a 4SPG... I never thought I'd see the day.")
('Agnès', 'Second Lieutenant Kaela!')
('Aaron', "Wouldn't have killed you to be more direct instead of<br/>goin' the 4SPG route.")
('Van', 'So am I speaking to Kaela, or am I speaking to<br/>the CID?')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "You're sharp. This may seem a bit...bureaucratic, but<br/>I've submitted this request in the CID's stead.")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "It concerns the armed machines that were released in<br/>the city during yesterday's attack.")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "We've confirmed that around half their numbers were<br/>destroyed, while most of the others retreated<br/>with Almata.")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "But we've also received word that two high-spec units<br/>might still be at large within the city.")
('Feri', 'Seriously?!')
('Quatre', 'We did encounter a few machines fitting that<br/>description yesterday...')
('Van', "I see... Yeah, the police probably have their hands full<br/>with 'em. You need a cleanup crew.")
('Van', "But Marduk and the guild don't really tickle your<br/>fancy, have I got that right?")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "Exactly. Marduk's involvement was the result of the<br/>President's more...heavy-handed approach. We're not<br/>too fond of that.")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', 'This is more a matter of professional pride<br/>than anything.')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "Special forces are due to arrive in the evening, and<br/>they're sure to complicate things. We'd much rather<br/>solve this problem ourselves.")
('Aaron', 'So you wanna loan us out to the CID for a day, is<br/>that right?')
('Agnès', "It's not just the CID—the principality requested this,<br/>too, I assume?")
('Agnès', "And whatever the case, we really can't have those<br/>things running loose...")
('Van', "Makes sense...ish. Outta curiosity, was this René...<br/>Ahem. Kincaid's idea?")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "He's pooled together his own task force to address<br/>the problem. They're negotiating with the President's<br/>office as we speak.")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "At the risk of divulging too many details, he's been<br/>pushing for a separate division meant specifically for<br/>these tasks.")
('Van', "Yeah, that tracks. Guy's resourceful to a fault.")
('Van', "(This really is a job for Marduk or the guild, but I<br/>guess the CID doesn't wanna swallow its pride.)")
('Van', "(We ain't exactly free, though, is the thing. We got<br/>other jobs to do...)")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', 'Would you be willing to work with us?')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', 'To reiterate, I seek your cooperation in handling<br/>these two rogue machines.')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', 'We should be able to put a stop to them before<br/>special forces arrive in the evening.')
('Van', "(This really is a job for Marduk or the guild, but I<br/>guess the CID doesn't wanna swallow its pride.)")
('Van', "(We ain't exactly free, though, is the thing. We got<br/>other jobs to do...)")
('Van', "Sorry, but we're up to our necks in other work<br/>right now. And we still don't know what Almata's<br/>really doin'.")
('Van', "Cards just ain't right today.")
('Quatre', '...')
('Aaron', 'We got our priorities. Sorry.')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', 'Right... We will eventually bring this business to<br/>other authorities.')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "But if you change your mind, let me know.<br/>We'll provide you all the support you need.")
('Van', 'Ehh, I guess we can look into this on the side. Lay it<br/>on me.')
('Quatre', 'Van...')
('Feri', 'We might find a lead or something!')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "You have my gratitude. Here's what we know about<br/>these rogue models...")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "They're most probably the same as the models<br/>employed by Vegas Films in Tharbad.")
('Aaron', 'Oh, THOSE assholes!')
('Agnès', 'And two of them at that...')
('Quatre', "You've fought them before? They sound like a<br/>real hassle.")
('Van', "Yup, 'cause they are. But how're they hiding in the<br/>city to begin with? They're too big.")
('Van', "They got some kinda optical camo or somethin'?")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', 'Not to our knowledge. The Ix-Alba has been<br/>patrolling and scanning the city from above<br/>since yesterday.')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "Marduk has cleared out the smaller units we've found,<br/>but the two large units have yet to be located.")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', 'Kincaid does have a theory...')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "He suspects that they're hiding in plain sight, and<br/>using some sort of radar jamming device to<br/>avoid detection.")
('Quatre', 'Hmm... I do remember hearing about special<br/>materials that can absorb or deflect orbal waves.')
('Quatre', "Which means we're probably looking for a container<br/>made of such material—likely brought into the<br/>city recently.")
('Van', "Either that or a van big enough to hold 'em.<br/>Probably pretty simple to deck one of those out in<br/>anti-radar stuff.")
('Van', "No idea whether Almata's driving it around<br/>themselves, though, or if they contracted that out<br/>to somebody.")
('Van', 'Think you can look into suspicious containers and<br/>transport vehicles for us?')
('Van', "We'll focus on the stuff that's out on the road.<br/>We split up and we should have this cleared up<br/>pretty quickly.")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "Understood. I'll mobilize the local authorities, and<br/>notify Verne and the Artisans' Guild.")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "If either of us makes any headway, let's keep each<br/>other posted.")
('Agnès', 'Thank you very much!')
('Aaron', "So what's the move? We hunt down every wayward<br/>van in town, we'll be out here all day.")
('Quatre', 'True... Traffic in and out has closed, but plenty of<br/>vehicles remain inside city limits.')
('Quatre', 'The main arteries fan out in all sorts of directions.<br/>Searching them all would be time consuming.')
('Van', "We got the cops on site, so we can leave the crowd<br/>control to them. We just gotta pinpoint where the<br/>transport's most likely to be.")
('Van', "New Town and the Artisanal District make the most<br/>sense to me—they've got the most traffic,<br/>freight especially.")
('Van', 'We get lucky—or I guess unlucky, in this case—and<br/>we might fish us up a robot.')
('Feri', 'Roger! So, we need to find people who drive stuff<br/>a lot...')
('Agnès', "Let's start asking around.")
('System', 'Quest Hidden Machines started!')
('Aaron', 'Nice. We got way more clues here than I expected.')
('Agnès', 'The two accounts we heard both involved a Red<br/>Star transport...')
('Agnès', '...which leads me to believe we are dealing with<br/>one—and only one—vehicle.')
('Feri', "I'm still freaking out about the whole 'driverless<br/>truck' thing.")
('Van', "Don't blame you. The fact that it happened at night<br/>turns this whole thing into a bona fide ghost story.")
('Van', "There's probably a logical explanation, though, and<br/>I'm sure Quatre can provide it.")
('Feri', 'Wait, for real?')
('Agnès', 'Oh, is it related to technology you have insider<br/>knowledge about?')
('Quatre', 'Correct. I believe it is utilizing tech that is currently<br/>in the R&D phase of development in many countries.')
('Quatre', "It's called an automated vehicle, and it allows a person<br/>to go from place to place without lifting a finger—<br/>because a holo core is doing the driving.")
('Quatre', "The fact that it kept going in spite of the empty<br/>soda can makes me strongly suspect it's an<br/>AI-controlled vehicle.")
('Agnès', 'My suspicions were correct, then. Renne told me a<br/>little about this before.')
('Feri', "Wow! That's so cool! So that means it wasn't a ghost.<br/>Phew...")
('Aaron', 'Well, maybe there WAS a driver—until his shitty job<br/>worked him to death. Now he lives on as a vengeful<br/>ghost behind the wheel...')
('Aaron', "Wait, what's that? Oh, SHIT! It's right behind<br/>you, Ferida!")
('Feri', 'Wha...?! EEEEEK!')
('Feri', "...Hey! There's nothing there!")
('Aaron', "BAHAHAHA! You should've seen the look on<br/>your face!")
('Agnès', 'Why are you like this...?')
('Van', 'You want me to stop calling you a kid, stop acting<br/>like one.')
('Van', "Back on topic. There was an incident regarding<br/>unmanned driving tech. Everyone in the underworld<br/>was goin' on and on about it at the time.")
('Van', "So I'm amazed this thing is driving around the city<br/>without causing any problems. It's kinda insane.")
('Quatre', "I'm not too surprised. You could prevent most<br/>accidents by connecting it to the traffic management<br/>system and the info on the city roads.")
('Quatre', "The technology should be state of the art. In fact, I<br/>suspect it's the same tech that caused Professor<br/>Callaghan's downfall.")
('Feri', 'Oh...')
('Agnès', "I-I'm sorry, Quatre...")
('Quatre', "You've nothing to be sorry for. And I'm all<br/>right, promise. Now's not the time to wallow<br/>in sentimentality.")
('Quatre', "So what's the plan, Van?")
('Quatre', "The AI's functionality and patterns could make it<br/>quite difficult to capture.")
('Van', "I know. Normally, I'd be fine with dumping this on<br/>the second lieutenant or the cops.")
('Van', "But I'm a car lover at heart, and I do NOT like seein'<br/>them be used as vehicles for bringing weapons into<br/>the city. This shit is personal.")
('Aaron', 'Figures. Well, any bright ideas, chief?')
('Van', 'First order of business is seeing how far this AI can<br/>really go.')
('Van', "Also, I'm gonna bring on some outside help for<br/>this gig.")
('Quatre', 'What kind of outside help?')
('Feri', "Wait, you don't mean them, do you?")
('Van', "Bingo. And they're right here in Basel, so I'm gonna<br/>call 'em up right now.")
('System', 'Van used his Xipha to get in touch with Junifer and<br/>the others.')
('System', 'The party then headed to the motor pavilion in New<br/>Town where they were waiting.')
('Agnès', 'Umm, do you have somebody in mind?')
('Van', "Yep.<br/>(I heard that they'd be here...)")
('System', 'Van used his Xipha to get in touch with some familiar<br/>faces in Basel.')
('System', 'The party then headed to the motor pavilion in New<br/>Town where they were waiting.')
('Willy', 'A sketchy transport vehicle? Lemme think about that<br/>for a sec. Lotta cars go by, so...')
('Willy', '...Well, now that you mention it, there was<br/>something funny this morning.')
('Feri', 'There was? What did you see?')
('Quatre', 'Any details would be great, no matter how small.')
('Willy', "So, you know we've got the whole lockdown thing,<br/>and it got me thinking about how I wanted to do<br/>business today.")
('Willy', "And I figured, y'know, people are still hungry, people<br/>need a pick-me-up—so I made my way out here,<br/>albeit a little later than usual.")
('Willy', "And this big ol' transport van comes up, and<br/>something about it just seems weird.")
('Aaron', "Weird? Were they drivin' all funny?")
('Willy', 'The opposite, actually. There was this little empty<br/>soda can sitting in the road.')
('Willy', 'And the transport just ran right over it. Like, made<br/>NO attempt to avoid it. The whole van kinda shook<br/>a little.')
('Willy', 'I got spooked and bolted out of the way, but the van<br/>just drove away like nothing happened.')
('Willy', 'The nerves on that driver, honestly. Stone cold.')
('Van', "Huh. Sounds like there's more to this story.")
('Willy', "That's what I'm thinking, yeah. 'Cause then, it turned<br/>right at that fork in the road ahead.")
('Willy', 'And when it did, I heard a THUD. I think whatever<br/>it was moving got shuffled around.')
('Willy', "At first I thought maybe it was some machining tool<br/>thunking around in there, but you'd think they'd stack<br/>'em so that they DON'T do that.")
('Willy', 'But like before, it just drove right off without a care<br/>in the world. I almost felt like I was just<br/>imagining things...')
('Quatre', 'I see.')
('Agnès', 'Did you catch what make the vehicle was?')
('Willy', 'Uhh... Yeah, it was a Red Star. A big one.<br/>Probably some delivery company.')
('Willy', "But it didn't have a logo, or branding, or anything on<br/>it—the van was just...unmarked. Kinda weird.")
('Aaron', "Yeah, that's a bit wack.")
('Van', "Thanks a bunch, bud. That's some really good info.")
('Willy', 'Glad to hear it! Anything to help—Goddess knows<br/>we all need it right now...')
('Willy', "...but I heard things are looking up. They said they're<br/>gonna open the roads back up tonight. Just gotta hold<br/>out a little longer!")
('Agnès', "Mhm. We'll find a way!")
('Feri', 'Thank you very much!')
('Junifer', 'Ah, Van! So did we get all that right?')
('Graham', 'You want us kings of the road to chase down an AI<br/>intruder, huh?')
('Aaron', "Don't underestimate 'em. You really don't know what<br/>you're getting into.")
('Feri', 'Umm, neither do I, to be honest...')
('Agnès', 'It does sound hard to believe, yeah.')
('Van', "I couldn't really go too in depth on the call, sorry.")
('Junifer', "That's freaky... A giant van just driving around all<br/>by itself?")
('Junifer', "And it's carrying assault robots inside it, too?!")
('Graham', "Yeah, it's pretty far-fetched. But honestly?<br/>I'm intrigued.")
('Graham', "We street racers take pride in our skills—and I'm not<br/>about to let some beep-boop bastard one-up me!")
('Quatre', 'Well, being an AI, it can process things much faster<br/>than you.')
('Quatre', 'Without a plan to catch it, it would probably<br/>outmaneuver you.')
('Junifer', "No sweat. We'll show that bucket of bolts what real<br/>people can do!")
('Junifer', "So what's the plan, Van?")
('Van', "Well, here's what I'm thinkin': we get my truck and<br/>your two cars...")
('System', "Van outlined his three-pronged attack to the group<br/>using a map of Basel's roads for reference.")
('System', 'Making sure not to overlook the robots themselves,<br/>he made combat preparations as well.')
('Graham', "Yo. We're all set here.")
('Junifer', "We've got our cars ready to go. Wanna get this show<br/>on the road?")
('System', "Combat will ensue upon beginning the operation.<br/>It is recommended to have the party's equipment in<br/>order beforehand.")
('Junifer', "Got'cha. Those things sound dangerous, so we gotta<br/>make sure we're ready!")
('Graham', "Don't you worry. We'll have 'em cornered faster than<br/>a collie!")
('Van', "Let's hit the road!")
('Van', 'You got a bead on the transport, Quatre?')
('Quatre', "Yes. I've pinged them on the traffic network.")
('Quatre', "They're patrolling the streets in a specific pattern.<br/>They're due to come by here in around<br/>twenty minutes...")
('Feri', 'Whoa...! There really is nobody behind the wheel!')
('Aaron', 'Tinted glass, too. They got this shit figured out.')
('Quatre', 'The transport has probably optimized its driving style<br/>to evade pursuers. Are you sure you can handle it?')
('Van', "Safety first, remember? Don't overextend.")
('Agnès', 'Best of luck!')
('Aaron', 'Damn. Wish she could take ME for a ride like that.')
('Van', "She really is her uncle's niece.")
('Feri', "They're keeping clear of other cars. So far, so good...!")
('Agnès', "How's the traffic looking?")
('Quatre', 'No congestion, as far as I can tell. If we can get<br/>it cornered...')
('Feri', 'We got it!')
('Van', 'Perfect! Get the CID, the Basel police, and the<br/>traffic guys!')
('Agnès', 'Right!')
('Quatre', 'This is Quatre! I invoke emergency authority to<br/>request a temporary road closure!')
('Aaron', 'Looks like it gave up...if machines can even do that,<br/>I dunno.')
('Quatre', "Perhaps it simply wasn't programmed to handle these<br/>sorts of situations.")
('Van', "Nah, it ain't that easy.")
('Feri', 'The machines are booting up!')
('Agnès', 'Junifer, Graham, get back!')
('Junifer', 'R-Right!')
('Graham', 'So it WAS carrying those things!')
('Quatre', "S-So, these are warrior models...? I see what you<br/>mean—they're from Marduk, no doubt.")
('Feri', 'Yeah, these are the ones from Vegas Films, all right!<br/>Two at once is gonna be tough... Be careful, guys!')
('Aaron', "On the flip side, we know how they work! Let's send<br/>'em to the scrapyard where they belong!")
('Agnès', 'Their joints are their weak points, according<br/>to Risette! Focus on those!')
('Van', "Let's clean 'em up before word gets on the street!")
('Junifer', "We... HAHAAA! Got 'eeeeeem!")
('Graham', 'Woooooohoohoo! Oh, man! That was like a<br/>movie shot!')
('Aaron', 'Heh... That all you got?!')
('Feri', 'Heh heh! That felt so much easier than the one we<br/>took down in Tharbad.')
('Agnès', "Risette's info really came in handy there.")
('Quatre', 'H-How often do you go around fighting things like<br/>that...?')
('Van', "I mean, ain't like we want to. Just sorta...happens.")
('Van', "Now, let's figure out how to shut off that<br/>auto-drive thingy.")
('Quatre', "Right. I'll get to work on—")
('Feri', 'Huh?!')
('Aaron', 'Are you shitting me?')
('Van', 'GET BACK!')
('Agnès', 'Aaack!')
('Quatre', 'Whoa—!')
('Junifer', 'H-Huh?! Look out!')
('Graham', 'Get away from that thing!')
('Feri', 'A-A third one?! Seriously?!')
('Aaron', 'Bastard waited for us to let our guard down!')
('Van', "I'll hold it off. You guys get backup—guild, Marduk,<br/>whoever, I don't care!")
('Agnès', "Van, don't...!")
('Feri', 'Huh? What are you...?')
('Quatre', "(What the...? What's that inside her purse?!)")
('Aaron', "Don't be a hero, dipshit! This is serious!")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', 'No need! Backup has arrived!')
('Agnès', 'Kaela!')
('Feri', 'A-And...!')
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', 'Hmph. You let your guard down.')
('Van', 'Shit! Close your eyes!')
('Aaron', 'GAH?!')
('Quatre', 'An optical weapon...?!')
('Feri', "That's his buster lance...! He showed me it back<br/>home once!")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', '...Incredible. I see now how you earned your<br/>title, Khamsin.')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "You had the measure of the situation from the very<br/>start, didn't you?")
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', "This was nothing more than our response as a part<br/>of crisis management. Our firm's concierge has<br/>previously analyzed the situation.")
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', 'I will leave the rest to the CID and the local police—<br/>as well as them. Farewell.')
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', '...')
('Feri', 'Kasim...')
('Agnès', 'That attack was incredible... He took out the robot in<br/>one fell swoop.')
('Aaron', 'Went right for the joints, too, just like she said.')
('Quatre', 'He looked like he barely lifted a finger...')
('Van', "Well, this IS Marduk's ace we're talking about.<br/>That's just what he does.")
('Van', "But hey, all's well that ends well, right? We still got<br/>the credit for it.")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', "...That in and of itself is aggravating, but I'm in no<br/>position to complain.")
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', 'At any rate, thank you for completing my request.')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', 'Given you did hunt down three units instead of two,<br/>your reward will be adjusted accordingly.<br/>Much thanks to you two as well.')
('Junifer', "Aww, heehee. We didn't do much.")
('Graham', "Hey, I'm just glad I got to have a good race!")
('Aaron', 'Tch... Talk about stealing the spotlight. What are we,<br/>chopped liver?')
('Feri', "Yeah... I've still got a long way to go before I can rival<br/>my brother.")
('Agnès', "I'm just glad we put a stop to those robots for good—<br/>even if it wasn't all us.")
('Quatre', 'Yeah... You have my thanks as well. Who knows<br/>what damage they would have caused if<br/>left unchecked.')
('Van', "Don't sell yourself short, bud. You helped a<br/>bunch, too. Plenty more where that came from—let's<br/>keep Almata on their toes!")
('Quatre', 'Right, of course!')
('System', 'With some fiddling, Quatre managed to decouple the<br/>auto-drive unit from the transport vehicle.')
('System', 'After the local authorities conducted their own<br/>investigation, the traffic restrictions were lifted, and<br/>all was back to normal.')
('System', 'Quest Hidden Machines completed!')
('System', 'Received')
('System', 'Where would you like to go?')
('Van', 'Authentication Rank error.')
('Van', 'Joy.')
