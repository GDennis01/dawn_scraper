('Agnès', 'What a gloomy passageway. If I had to guess, it must<br/>be twenty to thirty years old.')
('Van', "Yeah. Doesn't look like many folks come<br/>through here.")
('Van', 'Meaning, we may run into some real nasty monsters.')
('Agnès', 'W-We should really be careful, then.')
('Feri', "I'm feeling pumped already!")
('Agnès', 'Me, too!')
('Agnès', '...Wait, what?')
('Feri', 'Nothing makes a warrior feel more alive than a<br/>tough battle!')
('Van', "Think I get what you mean. Skip out on practice and<br/>you'll get rusty in no time.")
('Agnès', 'I-I see...')
('Van', 'Same goes for dancers, performers, and the like.')
('Van', "Slack off for too long and you'll be off your game<br/>when you need it the most.")
('Van', "Your heart an' body just won't be in it.")
('Agnès', 'I suppose that makes sense...')
('Van', "Also, make sure you pace yourselves in here.<br/>Gotta save some strength for the big 'un we're after.")
('Feri', "I'm raring to go!")
('Van', '...You even hear a word I just said?')
('Van', "Found 'em.")
('Agnès', "I-I can't believe a...thing like this has been lurking<br/>under the city all this time.")
('Feri', "It won't be for much longer!")
('Van', "This'll be the final leg of today's training, so make<br/>it count!")
('System', 'Found <br/>.')
('Agnès', 'Phew... What a fearsome monster.')
('Van', "I've seen worse.")
('Feri', 'That one actually made me sweat a little!')
('Agnès', "You two really are something... I'm<br/>completely exhausted.")
('Feri', "We'd be way worse off right now if we didn't have<br/>you backing us up!")
('Van', "Yeah. Wouldn't guess you were a student if I didn't<br/>know better.")
('Agnès', "Heehee. I'm glad I could help. So, should we head<br/>back up?")
('Feri', "Definitely. I'm starving!")
('Van', "Heh. You don't skip a beat. Let's roll.")
('System', 'Quest Bounty in the Waterworks completed!')
('System', 'Received')
('Agnès', 'Huh?!')
('Feri', 'Is something wrong?')
('Agnès', 'Did anyone else see the Genesis light up just now?')
('Van', 'On your toes, you two.')
('Judith', 'Err... How did you notice me?')
('Judith', 'Who are you people?')
('Van', "None of your business, but I've got an idea of who<br/>you are.")
('Agnès', 'Between the silhouette of cat ears and the way<br/>she moves...')
('Van', "...it's gotta be that kinkster Grimcat.")
('Judith', 'Who are you calling a kinkster?!')
('Feri', 'So this is that famous thief...')
('Feri', "I can't see her that well through the camouflage, but<br/>she's wearing a really tight jumpsuit.")
('Feri', "That outfit's so...adult. Will I be able to wear<br/>something like that someday?")
('Agnès', "Feri, stop! She's not a good role model!")
('Van', "Geez. I've hardly known you a minute, and you're<br/>already corrupting the kids.")
('Judith', 'Leave me alone! This is what Grimcat is supposed<br/>to wear!')
('Van', 'So you admit to being Grimcat.')
('Judith', '...Oh.')
('Judith', "Fine, sure! I'm Grimcat! You got a problem<br/>with that?")
('Van', "Couldn't care less, if I'm bein' honest.")
('Judith', "Come on, you're meeting a celebrity!")
('Judith', "Anyway, what do you want? You don't look<br/>like bracers.")
('Judith', "If you're down here, you can't be ordinary people.")
('Judith', 'Wait a minute—are you trying to lure me into<br/>a trap?!')
('Agnès', "No, not at all! We're just here because the CID—")
('Judith', "You're with the feds?!")
('Judith', "This jerk's been asking for it since the word go, so<br/>sorry, girls, but I'm forcing my way through!")
('Van', 'Do your worst, toots.')
('Feri', 'This will be great training! Few opponents are as agile<br/>as her.')
('Judith', "I'll teach you not to underestimate me!")
('Agnès', "Can't we talk this out...?!")
('Judith', 'Ugh. Not bad...')
('Van', "You're quick on your feet, but ain't it time to close the<br/>book on this?")
('Van', "'Cause I can read your every move.")
('Van', "How 'bout you take off that mask before I take it off<br/>for you?")
('Agnès', "(If I didn't know any better, I'd think Van's the bad<br/>guy here...)")
('Feri', '(Maybe he wants the cash prize for information<br/>on Grimcat?)')
('Judith', 'Grr... You really get under my skin, you know that?!')
('Judith', "I've had enough—it's time to pull out all the stops!")
('Agnès', 'Y-You were holding back this whole time?!')
('Feri', "Look alive! She's got a battle aura!")
('Van', 'Oh?')
('Judith', "I'm gonna put you in your—!")
('Judith', 'Err, time out...')
('Judith', 'Holy crap! When did it get so late?!')
('Judith', "Oh, I'm in SO much trouble!")
('Judith', 'I hope you know this is all YOUR fault!')
('Van', "You were the one jonesin' for a fight.")
('Feri', "We won't keep you here for my training if you need<br/>to go.")
('Agnès', "Umm. If you're in a hurry, you should probably<br/>get going.")
('Judith', 'I-I... Yeah, I guess so.')
('Judith', 'At least the two of you have some common decency.')
('Judith', "But this guy's a dirtbag, and someday I'll get him back<br/>for smearing my name!")
('Feri', "She's...not exactly what I pictured.")
('Agnès', 'Ahaha...')
('Van', "Even more of a letdown than I was expectin'.")
('Agnès', "There's no need to be so harsh.")
('Feri', 'She was really strong, though.')
('Feri', 'Even before she powered up, I could tell she was a<br/>genuine warrior.')
('Van', "Yeah, and she's usin' something that ain't a Xipha or<br/>RAMDA to cloak herself.")
('Agnès', 'I wonder if that has to do with why my Genesis lit<br/>up earlier.')
('Van', 'Oh, right. Hmm...')
('Agnès', "What's the matter?")
('Feri', 'Footsteps! Lots of them!')
(40451, 'Over there!')
('Agnès', 'Not again...')
('Detective Nate', 'What the...?!')
('Van', "Lady Luck just ain't on our side.")
('Detective Nate', "That's our line!")
('Inspector Daswani', "We sure run into each other often, don't<br/>we, spriggan?")
('Inspector Daswani', 'How about you two and your new friend come fill us<br/>in down at the station?')
(500, "Below Oración's Outskirts")
(40452, 'This is Point D.')
(40452, 'Men, ready yourselves to infiltrate the labyrinth.<br/>Do you remember your orders?')
(40460, 'Sir, yes, sir! Once we enter the city, fan out and put a<br/>stop to whatever is happening here.')
(40452, 'Good answer. Beta Squad, move out!')
(40452, '...?!')
(40451, "Wh-What's happening...?")
(40453, "I can't move!")
('Arioch', 'Hey there, party crashers.')
(40451, 'Who are you?!')
(40452, 'A kn-knight...?')
('Arioch', "I get that you wanna come join in the fun, but I don't<br/>remember inviting you!")
('Arioch', "But since you're all here and look skilled, try to show<br/>me a good time, okay?")
(40451, 'Uuugh!')
(40452, 'GAAAAAAH!')
('Feri', '...?!')
('Van', 'Right there!')
('Judith', 'Ahh!')
('Agnès', 'N-No way...')
('System', 'A fearsome foe is prowling around.')
('System', 'Found <br/>.')
('System', 'Found <br/>.')
('System', 'Quest Bounty in the Waterworks 2 completed!')
('System', 'Received')
('System', 'A fearsome foe is prowling around.')
('System', 'Found <br/>.')
('System', 'Found <br/>.')
('System', 'Quest Bounty in the Waterworks 3 completed!')
('System', 'Received')
('System', "Together, they continued following the<br/>impostor's trail.")
('System', 'By cross-referencing the leads they had so far with<br/>information on the orbal network, they finally<br/>identified the culprit.')
('System', 'And then...')
(40301, 'Heheh. Like taking candy from a baby.')
(40301, 'Better stow the goods back at base before I go out for<br/>round two—')
('Van', "'Sup.")
('Judith', 'So this really IS your base!')
(40301, 'H-Huh? The real Grimcat?!')
('Judith', 'Pick your jaw up off the floor, faker.')
('Judith', "You didn't really think you'd get away with using my<br/>name forever, did you?")
(40301, 'U-Uhh! Well...')
('Van', "Not a bad little operation you had goin' here.")
('Van', "After gettin' fired from the circus, you took to<br/>performin' on the streets.")
('Van', 'But when things started getting hectic, the<br/>opportunity to copy Grimcat and steal shit was just<br/>too good to pass up.')
(40301, 'H-How do you know so much about me?!')
(40301, "Whatever! I've been in tighter pinches than this!")
('Van', "Huh. Your impression ain't half bad.")
('Judith', "Is now really the time to mess with me?! He's getting<br/>away—!")
('Rixia', 'I think not.')
(40301, 'Ugh!')
('Judith', 'Oh!')
('Van', "The hell are you doin' here?")
('Rixia', 'I heard some unsavory rumors regarding a Grimcat<br/>impostor and decided to investigate the<br/>matter myself.')
('Rixia', "Though, it's clear now it would be swiftly resolved<br/>regardless of my intervention.")
('Judith', "Th-That's right! I totally could have handled this on<br/>my own!")
('Judith', 'Still... Thanks, Ri—ahem. Yin.')
('Van', "Well, what's done is done. Let's get out of here.")
('System', 'They then left the apprehended impostor in front of<br/>the police station with a note from the real Grimcat.')
('System', "After visually confirming the culprit's arrest, the three<br/>once more vanished into the night.")
('System', 'The door is locked.')
