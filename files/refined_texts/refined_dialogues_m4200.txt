('Aaron', "Man, this place looks old. You think those're airship<br/>parts lying around?")
('Agnès', "They're covered in moss, too. It looks like this road<br/>really hasn't been used in quite some time.")
('Quatre', "This isn't really an area I come to.")
('Quatre', 'Geological surveys have confirmed that there IS a<br/>large septium vein running under here, however.')
('Feri', 'Van! Look at this.')
('Van', 'Tire tracks from a big truck, huh? They look<br/>pretty fresh.')
('Van', "They must've been carryin' something real heavy.")
('Agnès', 'Maybe... Oh!')
('Van', "We're on the right track, then.")
('Quatre', "And there's that phenomenon again.")
('Agnès', 'It has to be resonating with that green Genesis<br/>we saw.')
('Aaron', 'All right! Time to get this over with before the CID<br/>and the guild make this their stomping ground!')
('Feri', "Right! We need to hit them while they're off<br/>their guard!")
('Quatre', "I'm not going to do anything reckless anymore.")
('Quatre', "So come on, you two. While the professor's away, it<br/>falls on us to—no.")
('Quatre', "That's not why I'm here. I'm here to protect what I<br/>hold dear—and with everyone's help, too.")
('FIO', 'Both the engineering skills and mental development<br/>of Quatre have reached the required parameters.')
('FIO', 'Unlocking the S-class offensive program,<br/>Digamma Driver.')
('XEROS', 'RUFF!')
('Quatre', '...?! Is this a technique that helps you two move at<br/>high speed while in sync?')
('Quatre', 'I think the professor told me that Yang and the<br/>others helped her develop this a while back.')
('Van', "Kinda neat that they're designed to unlock new<br/>functions as their user grows.")
('Feri', "I agree! It's really cool!")
('Aaron', "I don't get how it works, but yeah, it is awesome.")
('Agnès', "Even all the way out here, they're still supporting you.<br/>That must feel nice.")
('Quatre', "...Yeah. It does. And now, thanks to them, I'll be able<br/>to contribute even more in battle.")
('Quatre', "Let's get going. The abandoned factory should be<br/>just ahead!")
('System', 'Quatre learned the S-Craft <br/>.')
('Aaron', 'Well, sure is an abandoned factory, all right.')
('Agnès', 'Yeah. It looks really old—')
('Agnès', "It's reacting even more strongly than before!")
('Van', "Must mean the other Genesis is bein' used as<br/>we speak.")
('Quatre', "...Which from all we know about the professor's<br/>research means we need to hurry!")
('Feri', "Right! Let's find a way to infiltrate the building!")
('Agnès', 'Oh! Look! There it is!')
('Van', "So that's gotta be the prototype terminal we came<br/>looking for.")
('Quatre', "That's right. The one that would have formed part of<br/>the twin-core system.")
('Quatre', "It's presumably been connected directly to the<br/>septium vein, granting it the ability to pull resources<br/>from all over the region.")
('Quatre', "I doubt even cutting it off from the net would stop<br/>what's already begun. I can't believe he made such<br/>a system...")
('Melchior', "It does sound like it wasn't easy, that's for sure.<br/>My man poured a lot of sweat and blood into this.")
('Melchior', "Color me impressed you managed to find this place.<br/>That's some excellent sleuthing, Arkride Solutions. ♪")
('Olympia', 'I am also rather impressed that you did so without<br/>your Marduk concierge.')
('Aaron', 'Nothing to it. We could smell the stench of your<br/>filthy scheme from a thousand selge away.')
('Feri', "Besides, we didn't do it without Risette! She's right<br/>here with us in spirit!")
('Olympia', '...Hmm? I did not intend for my statement to<br/>cause offense.')
('Melchior', "Still, this development wasn't exactly in the cards.<br/>What are your thoughts, Professor?")
('Professor Callaghan', 'A most tedious turn of events, indeed. Why must<br/>you insist upon hindering my research?')
('Professor Callaghan', "No, I know the answer. You simply cannot stand the<br/>fact that I'm about to surpass your dear<br/>teacher's achievements.")
('Professor Callaghan', 'But the completion of this most supreme formula<br/>is nigh.')
('Professor Callaghan', 'My grand ambition realized, humanity will leap<br/>forward into a new future. I will thank you not<br/>to interfere.')
('Quatre', 'Oh, Professor...')
('Van', "We're up against a super-advanced AI that replicates<br/>one of the greatest minds in the country.")
('Van', "Now that he's not held back by his body, he doesn't<br/>even need to rest—he can work at full capacity at<br/>all times.")
('Van', "This might be worse than that computer from a year<br/>and a half ago. At least that one didn't have a genius'<br/>brain in it.")
('Agnès', 'And all of this is made possible by that green Genesis.')
('Agnès', 'All of this to try and create weapons of pure evil...')
('Professor Callaghan', 'Dear, oh, dear, young lady. Do try and see the big<br/>picture here.')
('Professor Callaghan', 'Military research has been a force that drives<br/>scientific development and civilization advancement<br/>since the dawn of its time.')
('Professor Callaghan', 'Our orbal communications technology and the<br/>airships we rely on are both fine examples of that.')
('Professor Callaghan', 'No, the nuclear weapons I seek to create will one day<br/>help bring about peace.')
('Professor Callaghan', 'Both as part of a larger puzzle in creating energy<br/>sources far more efficient than modern orbal energy...')
('Professor Callaghan', '...and as a true deterrent to erase war for good.<br/>None would dare be the first to pull the trigger when<br/>every country has nuclear weapons.')
('Feri', '...?!')
('Aaron', "Yep, he's sure as hell gone off the rails.")
('Van', "Even if all that happens, all you're gonna spread<br/>across the world is fear.")
('Van', 'That ultimate weapon created in Crossbell a year and<br/>a half ago was built on the same logic.')
('Van', "So if that reasoning had anything to it, why didn't<br/>that pave the way to peace first?")
('Professor Callaghan', "Don't compare my most noble research to that<br/>product of mere coincidence! My—")
('Quatre', "Please stop, Professor. We've heard enough.")
('Quatre', 'There are lines no researcher or engineer should cross.')
('Quatre', 'Human experimentation, biological weapons,<br/>brainwashing and mind control, gene editing...')
('Quatre', 'Manipulating the atomic structure of matter through<br/>fusion reactions risks creating energy beyond<br/>our control.')
('Quatre', "We already have a stable energy source in the form of<br/>orbal energy. There's no need to dabble with<br/>something so risky.")
('Quatre', 'That was why the institute decided to ban researching<br/>it—and other colleagues and workshops abroad<br/>followed suit.')
('Quatre', 'How could you do this when you were the one who<br/>taught me all of that?!')
('Professor Callaghan', 'I... Well...')
('Melchior', 'All pretty words, but a desire to taste the forbidden<br/>fruit is what makes us human, is it not?')
('Melchior', "The magicians of the Dark Ages didn't let taboos get<br/>in THEIR way.")
('Melchior', 'Going back further, you even have events like the<br/>Great Collapse painting how wild the times were.')
('Melchior', 'Tell me: is it fun forcing your own sense of morality<br/>upon everyone else?')
('Quatre', "You're twisting my words.")
('Quatre', "It's true that science and engineering are about<br/>learning to understand the laws that govern<br/>this world.")
('Quatre', 'But our goal is to do that as the humans we are at<br/>our core!')
('Quatre', "We don't achieve anything by casting aside our<br/>humanity—the relationships we've made, the society<br/>we've built...")
('Quatre', 'If we do that, then the entire foundation that inspires<br/>our search crumbles!')
('Quatre', "That's why we have to draw a line in the sand.")
('Quatre', "It's the only thing standing between the noble<br/>ambitions of those in our field—and the heinous<br/>abyss that awaits those who cross it.")
('Professor Callaghan', "Those were Professor Hamilton's...")
('Professor Callaghan', 'What idiocy! Your reasoning is as naïve as hers!')
('Agnès', 'If you really think so little of Quatre, why did you<br/>call him?')
('Professor Callaghan', '...?!')
('Professor Callaghan', "I'm so sorry... I screwed up...")
('Professor Callaghan', 'Please, stop this... Th-They want my—')
('Professor Callaghan', 'Aaaaargh!')
('Agnès', "Just before becoming an AI, you were filled with<br/>regret, weren't you?")
('Agnès', "You wished you'd never gotten involved with the<br/>mafia and been compelled to cross a line no<br/>human should.")
('Agnès', "After so much mental anguish, you regained your<br/>senses and realized just how far you'd gone...")
('Agnès', "You tried to fight back against them, didn't you?")
('Professor Callaghan', 'What nonsense is... I would never...')
('Van', 'That call does make a lot more sense when viewed in<br/>that light.')
('Van', "But there was no resisting this, and the conversion<br/>went ahead anyway—leavin' only an empty<br/>vessel behind.")
('Van', "I ain't got a clue if you even remember your last words<br/>after what happened to you...")
('Van', "...but if you're a recreation of the real Professor<br/>Callaghan, surely you can at least understand them?")
('Van', "I can't imagine someone so beloved by many—who<br/>even rivaled Professor Hamilton—couldn't.")
('Quatre', 'Van... Agnès...')
('Professor Callaghan', '...')
('Melchior', '...Are you done? This is getting rather tedious.')
('Melchior', 'Congrats on spouting baseless speculation to the last<br/>word—all without a shred of hard evidence to back<br/>it up.')
('Melchior', "It's going to take a lot more than that to sway<br/>someone who cast aside the very shackles<br/>of mortality.")
('Melchior', "Though it's no skin off my back if you decide to just<br/>throw up your hands and give up now.")
('Melchior', 'If you no longer care about the government casting<br/>you aside, or getting revenge on that impertinent<br/>Professor Cronkite.')
('Melchior', 'Or achieving the ultimate honor of surpassing the<br/>likes of Latoya Hamilton—of Claude Epstein, even.')
('Melchior', "If you're set on forgetting it all, of rendering all your<br/>effort, sacrifice, and humiliation for NOTHING, I<br/>won't stop you. ❤")
('Professor Callaghan', '...Y-You must be joking, Melchior.')
('Professor Callaghan', 'My resolve will never falter—not when the answer I<br/>have dreamed of for so long is close at hand.')
('Professor Callaghan', "No, I would damn myself before I ever thought to<br/>back down. I will NOT let all I've suffered be<br/>for naught!")
('Quatre', 'Professor...!')
('Agnès', 'We almost got through to him...')
('Aaron', "That's fine. Just means we're doing this the hard way.")
('Feri', 'At the very least, we need to get that evil imp out of<br/>his ear.')
('Van', 'Yeah. Then we might finally be able to have a proper<br/>talk with the guy.')
('Melchior', "You're surprisingly cocky for a group that struggled<br/>BEFORE you were a man down.")
('Melchior', "Think I'll break out the big guns. I wouldn't want<br/>to disappoint.")
('Olympia', 'Then I will release my first limiter as well.')
('Olympia', 'Ishtanti, engage Dominatus Mode.')
('Feri', 'It doubled its wings from two to four!')
('Aaron', 'Sure bodes well for us!')
('Van', "Well, we ain't turnin' back now! Time to settle<br/>the score!")
('Agnès', 'Right! For Risette, too!')
('Quatre', "With me, FIO! XEROS! We're going to put a stop<br/>to all this!")
('FIO', 'Understood, Quatre!')
('XEROS', 'RUFF!')
('Olympia', '...')
('Melchior', '...?!')
('Feri', 'We did it!')
('Aaron', "Hah! How's that, ya psycho?!")
('Melchior', "Mmgh... Oh, you'll pay dearly for that!")
('Olympia', 'They are more synchronized this time. We must<br/>respond in kind.')
('Quatre', "(Now's my chance to—)")
('Agnès', 'What...?')
('Van', '...Shit!')
('Renne', 'Get down!')
('Quatre', 'Whoa!')
('Agnès', 'Agh!')
('Melchior', 'Tch!')
('Olympia', 'When did you arrive?')
('Renne', 'Not a moment too soon, it would seem. Is everyone<br/>all right?')
('Agnès', 'R-Renne?!')
('Van', 'Hah. Hell of an entrance!')
('Melchior', "Heh. Well, here's a big player I didn't expect. Last I'd<br/>heard, you retired.")
('Melchior', "So what brings the Society of Ouroboros' former<br/>Enforcer No. XV here?")
('Aaron', 'WHAT?!')
('Feri', 'An Enforcer? Like the Direwolf?!')
('Renne', "I'll thank you very kindly not to bring up a lady's<br/>buried past before an audience, overseer.")
('Renne', "I didn't want to turn up uninvited, but you didn't<br/>leave me much choice.")
('Renne', "Not when you've opted to deploy such an<br/>underhanded trick where my friends were headed.")
('Agnès', 'That outline looks eerily like a...')
('Van', "Bah. Should've known.")
('Feri', 'A humanoid robot!')
('Quatre', "I-It's an Assault Frame!")
('Quatre', 'So this is where all those missing parts ended up!')
('Agnès', 'And it put the Genesis in its chest, too!')
('Professor Callaghan', "Why can't you just be silent and leave me to<br/>my work?!")
('Aaron', '...! Th-That sounds like...')
('Quatre', "It couldn't be—Professor Callaghan?!")
('Professor Callaghan', 'I am so close. So close to perfecting the divine<br/>formula I seek!')
('Professor Callaghan', 'So stop WITH YOUR<br/>INCESSANT MEDDLING!')
('Quatre', '...!')
('Van', "Crap. So he's inside that thing now?!")
('Renne', "I'll keep these two out of your way. You focus on the<br/>Assault Frame!")
('Olympia', 'Have it your way.')
('Melchior', "Well, lucky us! I'm sure you'll be a real ball!")
('Agnès', 'Renne!')
('Van', "She'll be fine! We need to focus on the job at hand!")
('Van', "Cutting edge as this thing is, it looks like they were<br/>sloppy in puttin' it together.")
('Van', 'Focus on the back of the joints! We gotta force it to<br/>the ground so we can get the Genesis out!')
('Agnès', 'Right!')
('Feri', "It's stopped moving!")
('Aaron', '*pant* How do you like us now?!')
('Renne', 'That was quite the performance!')
('Melchior', 'Feh!')
('Melchior', "...No, it looks like we're only just getting started!")
('Professor Callaghan', 'Ohh... OHHHHH!')
('Quatre', 'What...?')
('Agnès', 'The Genesis!')
('Van', "It's drawin' energy directly out of the septium veins!")
('Agnès', 'Oww!')
('Feri', 'Agnès!')
('Aaron', 'Damn it! Get back, kiddos!')
('Professor Callaghan', 'I WILL complete my formula...and there is<br/>no one who CAN HOPE TO STOP ME!')

('Quatre', 'Van!')
('Quatre', 'Wha...?')
('Agnès', 'Mare!')
('Mare', 'You and me have GOT to have a talk, buddy.')
('Mare', "This happens EVERY TIME now. You're doing it<br/>on purpose, aren't you?!")
('Van', "Ha! There you are! C'mon, hop to it! Let's go!")
('Mare', "I can't believe you...")
('Quatre', 'Wh-What is this space? And that holo is...')
('Mare', 'Not another peculiar catalyst...')
('Mare', "Well, I guess it's not a big deal. Will you bear the<br/>nightmare or—")
('Van', "Like I'm gonna say no!")
('Mare', 'At least let me finish my line!')
('Mare', "Gah! Shard swell! The Grendel's all yours!")
('Quatre', '...?!')
('Agnès', 'Heehee.')
('Van/Grendel', 'OHHHHHHHH!')
('Professor Callaghan', 'AUGH!')
('Feri', 'Van!')
('Aaron', 'All right! Here we go!')
('Renne', "So that's it.")
('Olympia', 'There it is.')
('Melchior', "A real sight, huh? I get a rush every time I see it—but<br/>it might've met its match with an enhanced<br/>giant robot.")
('Quatre', 'Wh-What am I seeing...? Is that Van...?')
('Feri', "We'll explain later!")
('Agnès', 'Right now, he needs our support!')
('Professor Callaghan', 'GET OUT OF MY WAAAAAAAAAY!')
('Van/Grendel', 'OHHHHHHHH!')

(40501, 'There was only 0.03% left to go... I was... I was<br/>SO CLOSE!')

('Renne', "So that's what a Genesis can do... As well as his...")
('Olympia', 'I cannot help but feel mildly fascinated.')
('Melchior', '*sigh* All that hard work, up in smoke...')
('Melchior', "The boss isn't going to be very happy. I hope you<br/>have a plan to make up for this.")
(40501, 'M-Melchior! Do something, please!')
(40501, "There's only 0.03% remaining! I-If it doesn't finish,<br/>all of this was for...")
('Melchior', 'Ahaha. An unfortunate situation indeed. So, how<br/>does it feel?')
('Melchior', 'How does it feel to know your research—your entire<br/>life—was just rendered meaningless?')
(40501, 'Huh...?')
('Melchior', 'You tried so, so hard, even throwing away your<br/>humanity, but an incomplete work is nothing but<br/>worthless garbage.')
('Melchior', 'So, how does it feel? Tell me, tell me, tell me!')
('Melchior', "It's too bad. He would've been much harder to break,<br/>but maybe I should've turned my charms on Professor<br/>Cronkite instead. ❤")
(40501, 'Ahh... Ahh... Ahh...')
(40501, 'AHHHHHHHH!')
('Quatre', '...')
('Agnès', 'How? How can someone be so evil?')
('Van', '...')
('Olympia', 'You have wasted enough time mocking<br/>him, Melchior.')

('Melchior', 'Oh, true. I suppose we should.')
('2nd Lieutenant Kaela', 'Targets sighted!')
('Bracer Alvis', 'What the...? Just what happened here?!')
('Melchior', 'Au revoir! We will be taking our leave now.')
('Melchior', "But we will have our revenge for all the time you've<br/>made us waste here.")
(500, 'October 25th, 4:25PM')
('Quatre', "It's no good! I can't stop the system from<br/>falling apart!")
('Quatre', "I can't reconnect it to the orbal net or another energy<br/>source, either. Supporting such an advanced AI is just<br/>too heavy a burden...")

('Quatre', '...But, Professor, that...')
('Van', "It's not gonna be easy to make use of finds from a<br/>technological singularity.")
('Renne', "That's putting it lightly... We're talking technology<br/>humanity wouldn't have reached on its own<br/>for decades.")
('Renne', "We'll need more than one genius around to make<br/>sense of it all.")
