('System', 'These settings are for checking mob placement<br/>during day/evening/night. Remove these once they<br/>are no longer needed.')
('Darvish', 'I noticed things have calmed down finally. Thank<br/>the Goddess. I wonder if the cops were actually useful<br/>for once?')
('Darvish', "There's still a lot to do with the festival, but now I<br/>feel a bit more confident about making it through it<br/>all in one piece.")
('Darvish', "It probably doesn't hurt that with the sightseeing<br/>airships flying around, folks on the ground are paying<br/>more attention to the sky.")
('Darvish', "I saw that the cops've been more active around here<br/>lately, so I got curious and decided to ask what<br/>was up.")
('Darvish', "They wouldn't tell me much, but it sounds like there's<br/>something bad going around the city that's<br/>causing problems.")
('Darvish', "With all the fights that've been breaking out, I'd bet<br/>they're after what's making people go nuts.")
('Darvish', 'I heard from the cops that folks around town have<br/>been getting, uh, rowdy lately.')
('Darvish', 'Around here, at least, people are going feral over<br/>parking spaces.')
('Darvish', "I'll try my best to hang in there until the end of the<br/>festival, but to tell you the truth, I'm at the end of my<br/>rope physically.")
('Darvish', 'I just need it all to be over so I can take a dip in the<br/>hamam and recharge... *sigh*')
('Darvish', "With all the cars here for the festival, running these<br/>lots is tough. We're seeing more and more accidents<br/>and burglaries.")
('Darvish', "Not that tourists didn't blunder into trouble before,<br/>but these last few days have seen a real uptick in<br/>rough types of all sorts.")
('Darvish', "Don't get me started on nighttime, when people<br/>have dinner in their cars and just chuck<br/>garbage out the windows!")
('Darvish', 'Would it kill those people to spare a thought for<br/>those of us who actually have to run these places?<br/>Seriously.')
('Darvish', 'This parking lot is public, so tourists staying at places<br/>without their own parking and whatnot get directed<br/>to park here.')
('Darvish', 'With all of the tax revenue and investments pouring<br/>into the city, these sorts of spaces are freely available<br/>to everybody, which is nice.')
('Darvish', "Unfortunately, with so many tourists coming here by<br/>car, it's only a matter of time before we run out of<br/>parking spaces.")
('Darvish', "Welcome to Tharbad! I'll be sure to look after your<br/>truck while it's parked here.")
('Darvish', 'We have a train station, but ever since cars got<br/>popular in the Central East, a good number of visitors<br/>chose to come by those.')
('Darvish', 'As a result, there are more parking lots around here<br/>than even just a couple years ago. But more cars<br/>means...more work. *sigh*')
('Darvish', 'Oh, well. We coordinate with the local police, so you<br/>all can rest assured that your truck is in safe<br/>hands here.')
('Officer Vernier', "Thanks to Edith's police stepping in and helping<br/>out, the situation has calmed down a little.")
('Officer Vernier', "Personally, though, I'm still on edge.")
('Officer Vernier', 'I still plan to take part in the Carnal Cavalcade and<br/>will be getting ready for it soon.')
('Officer Vernier', "But...I can't say I'm quite as excited as I might be,<br/>having to provide security from inside the parade.")
('Officer Vernier', "With the help of the Edith police, it seems like we've<br/>managed to get things under control after last<br/>night's events.")
('Officer Vernier', "That doesn't mean the work of we officers of the<br/>peace is over, though.")
('Officer Vernier', 'Even with that incident behind us, the film festival<br/>could still attract trouble.')
('Officer Vernier', 'I had to confiscate literally every piece of<br/>unauthorized merchandise that specialty shop had out<br/>on display.')
('Officer Vernier', "The staff were very apologetic about the whole thing.<br/>It seems that they weren't informed about what it was<br/>they were handling.")
('Officer Vernier', 'Apparently the vendor who originally sold it was<br/>going around to each store, taking advantage of the<br/>film festival campaign.')
('Officer Vernier', 'The nerve of them, tricking innocent stores into<br/>circulating such dangerous goods! Justice must<br/>be met.')
('Officer Vernier', "I might still be performing security while out there,<br/>but that doesn't mean I won't be giving it my all to<br/>dance as best as I can.")
('Officer Vernier', "After all, this is Mr. Gotti's parade we're<br/>talking about. I can't go out there making a fool of<br/>myself in front of someone like him!")
('Officer Vernier', "I didn't imagine Police HQ would get so involved in<br/>something like this, but here we are.")
('Officer Vernier', "But still! They're letting me take part in the parade,<br/>which is wonderful! It's such an honor.")
('Officer Vernier', "It's a lot to do on top of my security duties, but you<br/>can be sure I'll take both jobs seriously.")
('Officer Vernier', "It's a huge honor, being invited to perform in the<br/>Carnal Cavalcade. I'm so flattered you would ever<br/>think to ask me.")
('Officer Vernier', "But unfortunately, I can't just take the day off from<br/>my duties with the festival to go dancing. I'm<br/>really sorry.")
('Officer Vernier', "I always thought that Officer Kelvin didn't take his<br/>job as seriously as he needed to, but this time he's<br/>gone too far.")
('Officer Vernier', 'He outright abandoned his post! Can you believe it?<br/>I definitely need to have a word with the precinct<br/>about it later.')
('Officer Vernier', "I cut him some slack before, knowing he was new and<br/>needed to get used to the job, but I can't look past<br/>dereliction of duty.")
('Officer Vernier', "Tharbad's my home, so my work here feels fairly<br/>personal sometimes.")
('Officer Vernier', "It's all the more reason I'm trying extra hard to carry<br/>out my duties while such an enormous event is<br/>going on.")
('Officer Vernier', 'Unfortunately, not all of my colleagues in the force<br/>are quite as...diligent, which makes work that much<br/>harder for me.')
('Officer Vernier', "If everybody just did their jobs, I probably wouldn't<br/>have so much on my plate. Too much to ask for,<br/>I suppose...")
('Officer Vernier', "Those sorts of stalls are always a thorn in our side.<br/>They're so slippery that it's difficult for us to really<br/>crack down on them.")
('Officer Vernier', "When someone files a criminal complaint, that's<br/>when we can really lay down the law on them, which<br/>is something, at least.")
('Officer Vernier', "It'll have to wait until after the festival, but you can be<br/>sure I'll be recommending he's at least warned, if not<br/>outright removed.")
('Officer Vernier', "Tharbad's police force has never had to deal with an<br/>event of this scale before.")
('Officer Vernier', "Everyone's on edge as a result. I wish my fellow<br/>officers could ease up a little, but I do understand.")
('Officer Vernier', "We have help from other precincts, but at the end of<br/>the day, it's on us local police to do our best to keep<br/>this city safe.")
('Ihsan', 'A little sleep is all I needed to shake off all that<br/>agitation I was feeling yesterday. I feel like a<br/>new man again!')
('Ihsan', "I'm not sweating it at this point. It's not like my old<br/>man's caught wind of what happened, anyway.")
('Ihsan', 'Which means I can go out there and enjoy the film<br/>festival without anything weighing me down!')
('Ihsan', "Enough chitchat. Time to see what this city is like in<br/>full party mode. I'm not missing out on the action!")
('Ihsan', 'Come on, Hardy! Lay off, already! I know what I<br/>did wrong!')
('Ihsan', "You're getting bent out of shape over<br/>nothing, seriously!")
('Ihsan', 'I mean... Okay, I appreciate you covering for me<br/>while I was all worked up earlier.')
('Ihsan', "Hahaha, see that, Hardy? This ride's exactly the kind<br/>of thing a guy like me needs!")
('Ihsan', "This thing's built for driving through sand dunes.<br/>You were worrying about nothing at all!")
('Ihsan', "Sure, I might've kicked up a bit of sand, but that's<br/>part of the fun! I like seeing it in the air, it's like<br/>stardust blowing around.")
('Ihsan', "Now that I'm all hyped up, time to hit up those<br/>actresses and see if I can't conquer THOSE dunes.<br/>It's gonna be great!")
('Ihsan', "Why's my dad trying to keep me stuck inside the city?<br/>It's such a waste of a perfectly good car!")
('Ihsan', "Oh, well. At least there's the film festival. You don't<br/>get stuff like that around here every day. Might as<br/>well enjoy it while I can.")
('Ihsan', "This orbal hookah's good stuff. I guess for now, I'll<br/>just have to content myself with enjoying what's local.<br/>Could be worse, I guess.")
('Ihsan', 'I guess the film festival being so close has got me<br/>feeling fired up, because I could go for some<br/>excitement right about now!')
('Ihsan', "And there's nothing more exciting than cruising<br/>around the dunes!")
('Ihsan', "Get that crusty old butler in the passenger seat, and I<br/>just know we'll have a damn good time!")
('Ihsan', "If my dad's so keen on keeping me in town, then<br/>why'd he gift me such a sweet car, huh?")
('Ihsan', "With a ride this nice, it's just begging to be<br/>customized to Gehenna 'n' back and then taken out<br/>to satisfy the need for speed!")
('Ihsan', "Give it a rest, Hardy. I'm done being cooped up.<br/>I wanna see what else is out there! I NEED to!")
('Ihsan', "I can't stay stuck in Tharbad forever. You want this<br/>car Dad gave me to rust?")
('Van', "(Damn. Whoever this guy's dad is must have cash<br/>to burn. That's a fancy, high-end urban sports car,<br/>and that's only the start of it.)")
('Van', "(The suspension underneath that beast is Land Carrier<br/>class, and the intake's been modded to handle<br/>frickin' sandstorms!)")
('Van', "(Those aren't exactly off-the-shelf upgrades. Can only<br/>imagine how much mira's been stuffed into this thing<br/>to trick it out like this.)")
('Butler Hardy', 'Young master, I am afraid that is out of the question.')
('Butler Hardy', 'Your father has ordered me not to let you out of the<br/>city until you have completed your studies.<br/>Forgive me, sir.')
('Ihsan', "Eh, so what? There's nothing to stop the two of us<br/>from going out on a little joyride across the sand<br/>dunes, right?")
('Ihsan', "Those are TECHNICALLY still within city limits,<br/>so it's not like we'll be breaking any rules if we take a<br/>little trip out there.")
('Butler Hardy', 'Please, young master, you must be reasonable.')
('Butler Hardy', "The Sandsea is simply much too dangerous to go<br/>gamboling about in, I'm afraid.")
('Butler Hardy', 'I suppose the young master has indeed learned from<br/>his mistakes, inelegant as his choice of words may be.')
('Butler Hardy', 'Though I can only imagine it will now take even<br/>longer for his father to give him permission to go on<br/>trips outside of the city.')
('Butler Hardy', 'Ideally, it would be best if you spoke about your issues<br/>to your father directly, in your own words,<br/>young master.')
('Butler Hardy', 'Situations such as this are exactly why I always<br/>warn you to err on the side of caution! So we<br/>may avoid this very circumstance!')
('Butler Hardy', 'To think that you were seen in public not only<br/>having your possessions confiscated by the police,<br/>but yelling all the while!')
('Butler Hardy', "It's extremely fortunate that it didn't turn into a far<br/>greater incident and that the police have not charged<br/>you with anything.")
('Butler Hardy', 'But how on Zemuria am I ever going to explain what<br/>happened to your father...? *sigh*')
('Butler Hardy', "Y-Young master, I do believe I warned you.<br/>Such driving is incredibly dangerous and serves<br/>nobody's interest!")
('Butler Hardy', 'I am, of course, relieved to see that neither you nor<br/>your vehicle have been harmed by your excursion.')
('Butler Hardy', 'However, that leap through the air was<br/>truly terrifying! I felt as though I lost five years of my<br/>life watching that!')
('Butler Hardy', 'Young master, must we have this conversation again?')
('Butler Hardy', 'I fully appreciate your desire to live and roam as<br/>you please. Truly, I do.')
('Butler Hardy', 'However, your father is merely trying to ensure that<br/>you do not needlessly suffer out in the real world<br/>before you are ready.')
('Butler Hardy', 'That is why it is important that you learn etiquette.<br/>Once you do, you can appeal to your father to loosen<br/>his restrictions.')
('Butler Hardy', 'The young master was such an intelligent,<br/>well-behaved boy when he was young. The loss of his<br/>mother affected him profoundly.')
('Butler Hardy', "Even so, he does grasp the basics of etiquette. Yet<br/>these past few days, he's acted rather strangely.<br/>What could have happened?")
('Butler Hardy', 'Young master Ihsan comes from the largest trading<br/>house in all of Tharbad.')
('Butler Hardy', "Alas, he tragically lost his mother at a young age.<br/>He's since grown up lacking...regard for others, let<br/>us say.")
('Butler Hardy', 'As a result, his father has prohibited him from leaving<br/>the city until he learns to embrace proper decorum.')
('Butler Hardy', 'Unfortunately, the young master does not grasp that<br/>such limits are in place for his own good, to ensure he<br/>lives comfortably.')
('Orsini', "So this is Tharbad's idea of a film festival.<br/>It's certainly different from what we have in<br/>Messeldam, but not in a bad way.")
('Orsini', 'It seems like the kind of event you can simply turn off<br/>your brain and enjoy yourself, even if it is<br/>rather...flashy.')
('Orsini', "For all the pageantry of Messeldam's festival and the<br/>authority of its judging, it can get rather...<br/>stuffy, sometimes.")
('Orsini', 'This, on the other hand, has a more fun,<br/>lighthearted mood. And the traditional hookah I tried<br/>this morning was pretty good, too.')
('Orsini', 'Are the orbal hookahs contaminated or something?<br/>I saw the police going around confiscating<br/>them earlier.')
('Orsini', 'Not that I care. I feel perfectly fine, myself, and was<br/>planning on taking in the film festival as a change of<br/>pace anyway.')
('Orsini', "It's such a shame, the way the world is going.<br/>You never know where danger might be lurking<br/>these days.")
('Orsini', 'People seem to be really high-strung this morning.<br/>I hate it!')
('Orsini', 'Just as I was getting used to this place and sleeping<br/>soundly, too. Now I see this patch of dirt for what it<br/>really is!')
('Orsini', "But you know something? For some reason, I'm<br/>feeling...a little pumped up!")
('Orsini', "I feel like I'm young again! Young and dancing with<br/>my friends all over town!")
('Orsini', "After having a look around, I must admit, Tharbad's<br/>quite different from what I imagined.")
('Orsini', 'Growing up, I heard it was a dusty, quiet place<br/>without a lot to offer, and figured that was probably<br/>still the case.')
('Orsini', "But I really enjoyed the Cultural District. It's making<br/>me think maybe I should have a movie set somewhere<br/>in the Central East.")
('Orsini', "Although, knowing Salvatore Gotti's...inclinations, I<br/>suspect I know exactly what kind of 'culture' he plans<br/>on promoting in his parade.")
('Orsini', "I'm really attached to the Messeldam Film Festival, so<br/>I can't help but be worried about its future after<br/>everything that's happened.")
('Orsini', "But my daughter seems optimistic. Perhaps I'll try to<br/>think of this as more of a sightseeing trip and just try<br/>to enjoy myself.")
('Orsini', "Plus I've heard about those hookahs they have here.<br/>I think I might just take the opportunity to partake.")
('Orsini', "I've always looked forward to the film festival<br/>in Messeldam. I thought once it got canceled, that'd<br/>be it for film this year.")
('Orsini', 'I never expected anyone to put on another event in a<br/>place like this.')
('Orsini', "It's such a different-feeling city. I'm not sure it has<br/>what it takes to pull off a proper film festival.")
('Elene', "Come on, Mom, give it a chance. Movies are getting<br/>popular in the Central East. I'm sure they understand<br/>what makes them so special.")
('Elene', "Besides, Mr. Gotti himself has been putting it<br/>all together. That's got to count for something!")
('Orsini', "Maybe. I hope you're right. I'm still keeping my<br/>expectations in check. I just hope he keeps his tastes<br/>in check.")
('Orsini', 'Oh, I recognize that hotel from a movie! Perhaps if I<br/>get some location hunting in, too, this could be a fun<br/>trip after all.')
('Orsini', 'Elene, sweetheart, do you have any suggestions for<br/>places we should visit?')
('Elene', "I'm so glad my mom is enjoying the film festival now.<br/>At first, she wasn't sure if she'd like it.")
('Elene', "Now I just hope I don't lose her in the crowd...")
('Elene', "We came so far to enjoy the festival. Ideally, I'd like<br/>to make it back home together in one piece, too!")
('Elene', 'Are those orbal hookahs actually dangerous?<br/>The police seem to be carrying them out of stalls.')
('Elene', "My mom smoked a little bit out of one earlier. I hope<br/>she's going to be okay...")
('Elene', "She seems relaxed, though, so I'm probably just being<br/>paranoid...right?")
('Elene', 'The atmosphere here is so weird. Are festivals in<br/>Tharbad always this, uh, lively?')
('Elene', "I knew it wasn't going to be like the Messeldam Film<br/>Festival, but I didn't quite imagine it being<br/>THIS unhinged.")
('Elene', "And is it just me or is my mother being kinda loud?<br/>She's a lot more punchy and energetic than I'm used<br/>to seeing...")
('Elene', "My mom's idea of what Tharbad and the Central<br/>East are like has got to be at least 20 years out of date.")
('Elene', 'I think her mind might be starting to come<br/>around, though. She seems to have started<br/>enjoying herself.')
('Elene', "Although I just remembered... Mr. Gotti's supposed<br/>to be heavily involved in planning the festival<br/>here, right?")
('Elene', "I guess that explains why everything feels so much<br/>more...energized than what I'm used to<br/>in Messeldam. Maybe?")
('Elene', "Between you and me, I'm honestly shocked my mom<br/>came to check out the film festival.")
('Elene', "She's a little old-fashioned in some ways, not to<br/>mention her terrible sense of direction. Not the best<br/>combo for traveling.")
('Elene', "But I want her to have a good time, so I'm going to<br/>do what I can to help her out.")
('Muhsin', "I don't know what happened between last night and<br/>today, but there hasn't been anyone fighting<br/>this morning.")
('Muhsin', "I sure ain't gonna complain. Now I can go back to<br/>enjoying the festival in peace!")
('Muhsin', "Let's forget all that craziness and enjoy the film<br/>festival the way it was meant to be!")
('Muhsin', "Our prince has brought out that amazing airship<br/>and everything! It'd be a waste not to live it up and<br/>have fun!")
('Muhsin', 'Looks like the cops were conducting some kind of<br/>search on the store over there.')
('Muhsin', "They were hauling out those orbal hookahs I've been<br/>seeing around town lately.")
('Muhsin', "I've had some customers who smoked that stuff.<br/>Now that I think about it, they were all definitely<br/>acting a little loopy.")
('Muhsin', "I like to think I'm a man who can keep up with a<br/>festival when things heat up. But I've got to be honest<br/>with you...")
('Muhsin', "This one is wearing me out. I can't keep up when<br/>things get this crazy. *sigh*")
('Muhsin', "This festival's really something else, and let me tell<br/>you, I've seen my fair share of festivals in my time.")
('Muhsin', 'Gotta wonder how people find all this energy and<br/>vigor in the middle of a scorching hot desert.')
('Muhsin', 'Things are as bustling as ever come nightfall,<br/>which is great for me, haha!')
('Muhsin', "Tharbad's always been a little rough and tumble, but<br/>I've never seen the people here go THIS wild before.")
('Muhsin', "Not that I can complain. It's bringing in that much<br/>more money to me, so if that's what it takes, that's<br/>what it takes.")
('Muhsin', "Festivals are a great opportunity to rake in some<br/>dough, of course, but they're also just fun to be<br/>around, you know?")
('Muhsin', "You get to take in all of that energy, right there with<br/>your customers. It's a good time. Nothing else like it,<br/>I tell you!")
('Muhsin', "Hell, sometimes I take part in them just for<br/>that alone. It ain't always about business with me.")
('Muhsin', "It's been a long time since I've been in Tharbad.<br/>Business is clearly booming out here these days!")
('Muhsin', "Normally I do business over in Elsaim this time of<br/>year, but when I heard there was going to be a film<br/>festival, I couldn't NOT come.")
('Muhsin', "Now who wants some kebabs, huh? Don't be shy!<br/>What's a good festival without some even better eats<br/>to go with it? That's what I say!")
('Barker Zaltz', "Rumors've started going around that a certain film<br/>studio's closely linked to those orbal hookahs that<br/>have taken off around town.")
('Barker Zaltz', "Think there's any truth to it? Whatever the case, I'm<br/>glad we kept our hands clean, especially since the<br/>police conducted those raids.")
('Barker Zaltz', "Either way, now that the film festival's here, it's<br/>money-making season for us, so I'm not too worried.")
('Barker Zaltz', 'The police came around confiscating orbal hookahs<br/>along this street earlier.')
('Barker Zaltz', 'Now that I think about it, the visitors around here<br/>began getting more violent right around the time<br/>those things began showing up.')
('Barker Zaltz', "Makes you wonder if it's got anything to do<br/>with drugs. If so, I'm glad we kept our distance<br/>from them.")
('Barker Zaltz', "Granted, if whatever they're smoking helps them<br/>calm down so we have to rough fewer people up, it's<br/>hard to complain about that.")
('Barker Zaltz', 'You know that nightclub down the street?<br/>Sounds like one of its more popular girls is quitting.')
('Barker Zaltz', "Supposedly she got scouted by somebody in the<br/>film industry. The owner isn't going to stop her,<br/>either, seemingly.")
('Barker Zaltz', "You have to admire a show of respect like that.<br/>It's got to be a blow to their bottom line, losing<br/>someone like her.")
('Barker Zaltz', 'We had some scuffles out in the alley this morning.')
('Barker Zaltz', 'They were practically back-to-back, which is unheard<br/>of at such an early hour, even in our neck of<br/>the woods. Or desert, rather.')
('Barker Zaltz', "Fights are such headaches for me. If any break out at<br/>places we're contracted with, I have to go and sort<br/>them out, which is no fun.")
('Barker Zaltz', 'Hey there, folks! Need something to do tonight?<br/>In fact, you boys thinking of going off by<br/>yourselves later?')
('Barker Zaltz', "Because if you are, I know some fun joints you'll<br/>enjoy that I keep to myself during the day, if you<br/>know what I mean.")
('Aaron', "Hell yeah. Now you're speaking my language.")
('Aaron', "I'm from Langport, so I know a thing or two about<br/>having fun. Definitely interested to see how good this<br/>town can party.")
('Barker Zaltz', "That's the spirit! Then here's a tip: check out the<br/>underground nightclub that's just past here.")
('Barker Zaltz', 'The girls there are the real deal. Just about everyone<br/>comes away from there a happy customer, trust me.')
('Agnès', 'Aaron, your thoughts remain sparkling pure, I hope.')
('Van', "Stay focused, kid. We're here on business, remember?")
('Van', "Though granted, it might not be the worst idea to slip<br/>in there for a bit. Never know what kind of dirt you'll<br/>dig up in those joints.")
('Barker Zaltz', 'It sounds like some new girls have recently joined the<br/>nightclub, too.')
('Barker Zaltz', "They tend to have their reasons for being there, but<br/>they're all legit. You'd have to be crazy not to like<br/>what they have to offer.")
('Barker Zaltz', 'Hey there, boys! Out doing a little sightseeing?')
('Barker Zaltz', "If you're looking for something to check out, I can<br/>hook you up with all kinds of places!<br/>Everybody knows me around here.")
('Barker Zaltz', "Tharbad is full of fun spots that only the locals<br/>really know. We've got casinos, bars...")
('Barker Zaltz', "If it was just us lads talking, I could even tell you<br/>about some of the city's 'hottest' attractions, if you<br/>catch my drift.")
('Aaron', "Oh? What do you mean by 'hot'? Because if it<br/>involves some hot ass, I'm down to party.")
('Agnès', 'A-hem! Aaron, you seem to be forgetting we have<br/>Feri with us.')
('Van', "To be fair, spots like that can be worth visitin' in our<br/>line of work. You'd be surprised how much dirt you<br/>can dig up in places like that.")
('Van', "But she's right. You can forget it while we've got the<br/>kid with us. Just keep it in the back of your mind<br/>for later.")
('Barker Zaltz', 'People often refer to Tharbad as the city of pleasure,<br/>and for good reason.')
('Barker Zaltz', "There's plenty more to be found here beyond just<br/>sparkly hotels and traditional rest-houses.")
('Barker Zaltz', "If you want to learn more, I'd be more than happy to<br/>fill you in. Just ask!")
('Bobly', "Oh, yeah. I guess the film festival's going to start<br/>soon, isn't it? People seem to be awfully excited for<br/>it, but...")
('Bobly', "If that girl dances at the parade, I guess that means I<br/>really won't see her at the nightclub ever again, will I?")
('Bobly', "It was a short run, but when I think about it, maybe<br/>the film festival's the best way for her to close things<br/>out, after all.")
('Bobly', "My beautiful savior... I hear she's going to be quitting<br/>the nightclub. Could it be true?")
('Bobly', "I mean, yeah, I'm excited to watch her perform in<br/>the parade. But if she doesn't come back to the club...")
('Bobly', "Wh-What am I supposed to do? She and I have made<br/>so many wonderful memories there! She can't<br/>just LEAVE!")
('Bobly', "I was... I was even starting to think about maybe<br/>settling down in this city. Like I'd finally found<br/>my home. But now...now what?!")
('Aaron', "(This dork's completely lost it. Even I can't imagine<br/>throwing literally everything away for a girl like this<br/>sad sack.)")
('Bobly', 'If... If that girl gets picked up for the film festival and<br/>she...she gets farther and farther out of reach, then...')
('Bobly', "Does that mean I won't be able to watch her<br/>dance anymore? Will I...not be able to breathe the<br/>same air as her?")
('Bobly', 'Gazing at her from farther and farther away, will<br/>that...will that still give me the strength to live like<br/>before...?')
('Bobly', 'Last night, I saw...that girl at the nightclub again.<br/>Oof, just remembering her makes me feel so...!')
('Bobly', "*sigh* What am I doing? That dancer is my<br/>daughter's age. Yet here I am, lusting after her...")
('Bobly', "But I can't...I can't stop myself! I don't care if<br/>it's wrong! I've gone too far to give up now!")
('Van', '(Last night, huh? That must make him a fan of a<br/>certain dancer.)')
('Van', "(Guess it takes all kinds when you're as popular<br/>as her.)")
('Aaron', "(Yeah, this guy's having a real normal one. He's in<br/>way too deep.)")
('Feri', "(I don't get it. Are you guys talking about that place<br/>you two visited last night?)")
('Agnès', "(*sigh* All I'll say is, whatever you two saw in there,<br/>I'm glad Feri wasn't exposed to it.)")
('Bobly', "It's...so hard to explain what her dancing means<br/>to me. When we're in the same space, it's like...I can<br/>feel her very breath.")
('Bobly', 'Like our breathing is somehow...synchronized with<br/>one another...')
('Bobly', "It's as if her breathing is what keeps me alive!<br/>What gives me life itself!")
('Bobly', 'I know I saw that dancer somewhere around here<br/>at night.')
('Bobly', 'What could she be possibly doing in the<br/>Entertainment District at such a late hour? I need to<br/>find out...')
('Bobly', "Gah, what am I saying?! Just because my wife left me<br/>doesn't mean I can start stalking some local! I need to<br/>get my head on straight!")
('Bobly', "It's been a month since my wife left me. Since then,<br/>I've wondered which would mend my broken heart:<br/>beauty or excitement.")
('Bobly', "I've been traveling, trying to figure that out, and two<br/>days ago, I finally found my answer—nay, my fate, in<br/>the Cultural District!")
('Bobly', "My heart needs both beauty and excitement, and I<br/>found it in that dancer! She's exactly what I've been<br/>looking for this whole time!")
('Officer Kelvin', 'Feels bad getting scammed by that seller, huh?')
('Officer Kelvin', "But hey, at least you're not out that much<br/>money, right?")
('Officer Kelvin', "I'd give up and take the loss if I were you. Consider it<br/>the price you pay for learning how things work in<br/>this town.")
('Officer Kelvin', "Man, this film festival's turning out to be a bigger<br/>pain in the ass to secure than I thought. Hope we get<br/>bonuses for our trouble.")
('Officer Kelvin', "Guess nobody's caught on to me going to the casino<br/>and smoking my hookah, though. I mean, nobody's<br/>yelled at me lately, so...")
('Officer Kelvin', "Who knows? Just got to trust everything's good for<br/>now and actually focus on my job!")
('Officer Kelvin', "Shit, I didn't expect this to turn into such a<br/>big deal.")
('Officer Kelvin', "If they find out I was smoking that stuff, I'm in for a<br/>lot more than a write-up next time.")
('Officer Kelvin', 'I better keep my head low and just try to do my job<br/>for now. Do my job and hope for the best...')
('Officer Kelvin', "Man, do people really expect me to just stand around<br/>doing nothing all day while this town's one big river<br/>of money?")
('Officer Kelvin', "Working hard's for suckers! I'm going to make a<br/>killing at this casino and then so long to the stuffy,<br/>low-paying cop life!")
('Officer Kelvin', "I mean, what's fair about having us work while<br/>everyone else around here gets to have fun, huh?<br/>Nothing, that's what!")
('Van', "(Talk about not being cut out for a job. This guy<br/>wouldn't know the meaning of hard work if it was<br/>tied to a brick and thrown at his face.)")
('Officer Kelvin', 'Haha, these cutting-edge orbal hookahs are the best!')
('Officer Kelvin', "They're easy to hide, and even better, they're a great<br/>way to cope with the heat here.")
('Officer Kelvin', "I'm telling you, without a good way to relax, there's<br/>no way I'd be able to do my job.")
('Officer Kelvin', 'I bet something like this would do Officer Vernier<br/>some good, too. That woman seriously needs to learn<br/>to chill out.')
('Officer Kelvin', "Man, can't a guy take a little break in peace<br/>around here? The heat out here gets tiring when you<br/>aren't used to it.")
('Officer Kelvin', "All I did was smoke a bit of hookah on the job and I<br/>get written up for it. Bit harsh for such a minor<br/>offense, don't you think?")
('Officer Kelvin', 'I heard there are these new pocket-sized orbal<br/>hookahs you can buy, though.')
('Officer Kelvin', "I'm pretty interested. I hear they have a pretty<br/>refreshing flavor. Maybe I won't get caught with<br/>something like that. Hmm...")
('Clemens', "Phew, I didn't expect the film festival to be so wild<br/>and outrageous.")
('Clemens', "I don't know if someone as ignorant about movies as<br/>me was meant to be here...")
('Clemens', "All this energy is so much to take in. It's making my<br/>head spin...")
('Clemens', '(Whew...)')
('Clemens', "Maybe it's just me, but do you get the feeling people<br/>are going a little...crazier than they were yesterday?")
('Clemens', "Do people here always go so hard when<br/>they're excited? I don't know how they can do it, if so.")
('Clemens', "If people are getting so hot and bothered about the<br/>film festival, I guess that's a good sign we're in for<br/>something fun, at least.")
('Clemens', "I don't really watch movies, so I don't know much<br/>about what's going on, but even I'm pretty curious at<br/>this point.")
('Clemens', "Boy, am I glad my client's got air conditioning in<br/>their office, or else I would've been a sweaty mess<br/>during our meeting.")
('Clemens', "Actually, while we were talking, they told me there's<br/>going to be a film festival and that's why everyone is<br/>so jazzed up.")
('Clemens', "I don't pay attention to entertainment news at all, so I<br/>had no idea they were putting on anything like<br/>that here.")
('Clemens', 'It just so happens my schedule opened up, so I might<br/>make time to check it out, just to see what all the fuss<br/>is about.')
('Clemens', "It's so hot. How is it October and it's still feeling<br/>like this?")
('Clemens', "Next time I engage in talks to do business with a<br/>Central Eastern firm, I'm going to ask for<br/>winter meetings.")
('Clemens', "Anyway, is there going to be some sort of<br/>festival here? People seem to be awfully excited about<br/>whatever's brewing in town.")
('Nino', 'I heard something crazy happened at Vegas Films last<br/>night in the midst of all their film festival prep.')
('Nino', "You know, I haven't seen Mr. Dillon around for a<br/>little while now. You don't think something<br/>happened to him, do you...?")
('Nino', "I know it's rude to gossip, but as a creator and all, it's<br/>hard not for my mind to run wild with this sort<br/>of thing.")
('Nino', "Well, maybe we'll hear something later. For now, I'm<br/>just going to try and get as much inspiration at the<br/>festival as I can!")
('Nino', "Now that I think about it, they're probably more<br/>concerned with judging movies for the festival right<br/>now than with checking out our work.")
('Nino', "It might be best to just focus on checking out the<br/>festival and make something else. I'm sure we can try<br/>again later.")
('Nino', "Maybe we'll try bringing in another film once things<br/>calm down around here. It'll give us time to apply<br/>what we learn here, too.")
('Nino', "You've got this, Cervi! I know you're not that athletic,<br/>but you can still do it! I believe in you!")
('Nino', "Just think: if you leave a good impression with Gotti,<br/>we might be able to get him to watch our film! It'll be<br/>all worth it in the end!")
('Nino', 'I feel like things are extra chaotic outside today, even<br/>with the film festival so close.')
('Nino', "Even in Vegas Films itself, it felt weirdly tense for<br/>some reason. Maybe I'm just imagining things, but I<br/>don't know...")
('Nino', "Guess I'll have to give up on getting a tour today.<br/>Today feels like a really bad day to disturb them.")
('Nino', 'I officially dropped our amateur film off at<br/>Vegas Films.')
('Nino', "Because they're so busy getting ready for the festival,<br/>though, they said they won't be able to check it out<br/>right away.")
('Nino', "I get that we came at a busy time and all, but I hope it<br/>doesn't take too long. I really want to know what<br/>they think!")
('Nino', 'I brought a memory quartz containing an<br/>independent film I made with my friend, as well as a<br/>movie report.')
('Nino', 'When you think successful, vibrant studio, these days<br/>the first thing that comes to mind is Vegas<br/>Films, right?')
('Nino', "So I figured, who better to ask to evaluate our work as<br/>amateur filmmakers than them? Hopefully they'll give<br/>us a fair shake.")
('Nino', "Whoa, check it out, Cervi! It's the Al-Jumeirah hotel!")
('Nino', "I know we don't have any business there, but wow, it<br/>sure would make for some amazing shots if we got to<br/>film it!")
('Cervi', "It's nice and all, Nino, but are you telling me you<br/>didn't notice the famous director who literally just<br/>walked right past us?")
('Cervi', 'You know that guy with the glasses? That had to have<br/>been Leslie Lam! The director! I just know it!')
('Nino', "Holy crap, good eye! I didn't realize that at all!")
('Nino', 'Did you happen to see where he was headed?')
('Cervi', 'It looked like he was walking over to...Vegas Films!')
('Cervi', "Wait. That's where we're supposed to be going!")
('Nino', "Yikes! You're totally right! I got so caught up<br/>sightseeing, I forgot why we're even here.")
('Nino', "I'm glad you said something or else I wouldn't have<br/>remembered to drop off our film there!")
('Cervi', '...Anyway, yesterday I ended up staying back until<br/>night to get some intensive dance lessons.')
('Cervi', "By sheer luck, I managed to give Mr. Gotti our film,<br/>but unfortunately, we didn't have time to<br/>actually talk.")
('Nino', "Damn, Cervi, I had no idea. You definitely look like<br/>you've been through the wringer, though...")
('Nino', 'But good for you! It sounds like everything with the<br/>festival and parade is still on track, too.')
('Nino', "You can be sure I'll be filming you as you're out there<br/>strutting your stuff. It should make for a nice<br/>trip souvenir!")
('Cervi', 'Thank you, Nino. I have no intention of giving up on<br/>being a film creator, but I would like something to<br/>remember all this by.')
('Nino', "Oh, I just remembered, that specialty store across the<br/>street sells energy drinks that're supposed to help<br/>with fatigue.")
('Nino', "I'll buy you one. My treat for how hard you've<br/>been working.")
('Cervi', "Aww, I'd like that... Thanks, Nino.")
('Cervi', "I can't afford to make a mockery of Mr. Gotti's<br/>Carnal Cavalcade with any regular old,<br/>mediocre dancing. No sir!")
('Cervi', "I'm a new person and I'm going to prove myself to<br/>him no matter what! Not as a performer, but a fellow,<br/>budding film director!")
('Cervi', 'Did something happen at Vegas Films after we left<br/>last night? We saw a ton of cops walking around<br/>this morning.')
('Cervi', "Maybe I'm overthinking it. The film festival is still<br/>happening, so whatever it is, it can't have been that<br/>big of a deal, could it?")
('Cervi', "In which case, once things calm down, we'll visit<br/>them again and try to sell them on our work!")
('Cervi', "Now that we have a plan, we're just going to take in<br/>the film festival and use what we learn in our<br/>next movie. It'll be great!")
('Cervi', 'I really want to show Mr. Gotti our independent<br/>movie that we brought, if at all possible.')
('Cervi', "First, I need to learn how to dance so they'll bring me<br/>into the parade as a backup dancer!")
('Cervi', "Just you watch, Nino! I'm going to bowl over the<br/>people running the festival with my smooth moves, or<br/>die trying!")
('Nino', 'Hey, if you get a chance to talk to Mr. Gotti, you<br/>should bring up our movie!')
('Cervi', "Totally! I don't know if I'll be able to get a word in<br/>edgewise with him, though, let alone talk about that...")
('Cervi', "Everybody at Vegas Films seems busy getting ready<br/>for the film festival. I'm worried we might've ruffled<br/>some feathers.")
('Cervi', "We got impatient and tried to give them a proposal<br/>we came up with, but it's probably going to be a while<br/>before we hear back. *sigh*")
('Cervi', "I want to make sure we enjoy our time out here,<br/>especially as our way of showing thanks to everybody<br/>at Vegas Films for what they've done.")
('Cervi', 'It sounds like the selection process is going to take<br/>time, anyway, so we might as well look around and<br/>check stuff out while we wait.')
('Cervi', "After all, the film festival's attracted lots of actors and<br/>production staff we wouldn't otherwise normally get<br/>to meet. That's exciting!")
('Cervi', "We spent a lot to travel out here, so we need to make<br/>the most of it and enjoy ourselves, too. Maybe I'll ask<br/>for some autographs...")
('Cervi', "I just caught my first glimpse of President Dillon in<br/>the flesh and, you know, he's not quite what I<br/>imagined him to be.")
('Cervi', "I figured as the head of an up-and-coming film<br/>studio, he'd be a more flexible and daring leader, but I<br/>guess not.")
('Cervi', 'I guess Vegas Films owes its rapid rise to Salvatore<br/>Gotti and his talent behind the camera more than<br/>anything else.')
('Cervi', "There are so many celebrities out and about here.<br/>It's easy to get distracted when you see one.")
('Cervi', "I guess the film festival is almost here. We've been so<br/>focused on dropping off our movie with Vegas Films<br/>that I guess we forgot...")
('Cervi', "And then we forgot when we saw Mr. Lam!<br/>Now I feel like we're all kinds of turned<br/>around, sheesh.")
('Philica', "Thanks for all your detailed feedback earlier.<br/>It'll definitely help me hone that ice cream so it's<br/>pitch perfect.")
('Philica', "Tell your bartender friend I hope those pomegranates<br/>will help him make something special and win<br/>that tournament. I'll be rooting for him!")
('Philica', "Finally, the film festival is here! It's so exciting!")
('Philica', "It's not a traditional sort of festival, but girls of my<br/>generation tend to like events like this anyway.")
('Philica', "I can see why older folks are maybe raising an<br/>eyebrow over some of this, but what's the harm in<br/>it, really?")
('Philica', "Apparently when the oasis was rejuvenated, we went<br/>crazy with festivals, then, too, so it's not like it's<br/>unheard of.")
('Philica', 'I saw a bunch of policemen going around, taking<br/>away orbal hookahs earlier.')
('Philica', 'Wonder if some kind of defect was found in them?<br/>Hygiene regulations are pretty strict these days.')
('Philica', "Those orbal hookahs burst onto the scene so<br/>suddenly, it honestly wouldn't shock me if they had<br/>some sort of problem.")
('Philica', "Maybe it's just my imagination, but it feels like<br/>people are more feisty today. Not just tourists, either,<br/>but the locals, too.")
('Philica', "I thought I had my finger on the pulse of things<br/>better than my folks, but I'm completely stumped as<br/>to what's going on here.")
('Philica', 'There are so many people here tonight.')
('Philica', "Lately I've been seeing more and more sorts you don't<br/>usually get in the evenings. Probably because of the<br/>film festival.")
('Philica', "Not that I'm complaining. More sales for me!<br/>I'm looking to save up and travel, so as far as I'm<br/>concerned, it's all good luck.")
('Philica', 'Hey, folks! Need something cold to cope with<br/>the heat?')
('Philica', "I've got traditional local drinks to quench that thirst!<br/>Or if you're looking for something modern, I've got<br/>plenty of trendy drinks, too!")
('Philica', "Honestly, between you and me, I'm more into the<br/>latter, and I say that despite being born and<br/>raised here.")
('Philica', "But that's the way it goes these days. There are plenty<br/>of Central Eastern girls like that.")
('Sparks', 'Now this is how you hold a festival! This is the kind<br/>of energy I live for!')
('Sparks', 'Who cares what happened yesterday? All that matters<br/>now is how well my dulcet baritones can add to these<br/>amazing festivities!')
('Sparks', "Let's light it up, folks! What do you say? Oh, and<br/>don't forget to order some food while you're at it,<br/>too, hahaha!")
('Sparks', 'Hey, any idea what the cops are going<br/>around confiscating? Is it those orbal hookahs?')
('Sparks', "I don't know what could've brought that on, but it's<br/>sure to rain on some people's parades.")
('Sparks', "But not to worry! I can make up for that with as<br/>much singing and grub as they need! Whatever makes<br/>'em feel better!")
('Sparks', 'There was a weird commotion around here earlier.')
('Sparks', 'First people started brawling. Then, all of a sudden,<br/>we had people tearing off their clothes and yelling<br/>real loud.')
('Sparks', "I know it's festival season and all, but that's not how<br/>you hold a celebration!")
('Sparks', "What the hell has gotten into people, huh? It's like<br/>they all forgot how to have fun.")
('Sparks', "I'm getting a lot of people eating dinner at my stall,<br/>which feels great.")
('Sparks', "Nothing's as tasty as a good bite to eat outside during<br/>a festival, especially with my singing to accompany<br/>it, bahaha!")
('Sparks', "I'm telling you, my silky voice makes everything taste<br/>exponentially better! It's science, I tell you! Science!")
('Sparks', 'Hi there! You all enjoying Tharbad so far?')
('Sparks', "You know, if there's one thing both a good festival<br/>and a good movie need, it's music! Music and singing!<br/>They're just empty without 'em.")
('Sparks', "I'm just a two-bit musician myself, but you can bet I'll<br/>be adding to the chorus, in my own way, over here!")
('Inspector Daswani', "I won't deny that you all were helpful in obtaining<br/>evidence for the orbal hookah case. I'll grant you<br/>that much.")
('Inspector Daswani', "But that doesn't mean you can stick your noses into<br/>whatever police business you like. Especially not a<br/>murder case.")
('Inspector Daswani', "Go play bodyguard or whatever else it is you're doing<br/>and leave the police work to the professionals.<br/>Understood?")
('Inspector Daswani', "The CID has already determined how it'll go about<br/>controlling the information for this case, as well as<br/>gradual disclosure to the public.")
('Inspector Daswani', 'That means our only job as police is to gather<br/>the hookahs and round up the perpetrators.')
('Inspector Daswani', "I'm not exactly keen on being a pawn for the CID,<br/>but if nothing else, at least it allows us to focus on<br/>what we do best.")
('Inspector Daswani', "I have a bad habit of being soft when it comes to<br/>things like this. But it will serve our interests, so I'll<br/>put in a word for her.")
('Inspector Daswani', "She'll probably get an official call about it from the<br/>higher ups soon, but if you could go ahead and tell<br/>her, I'd appreciate it.")
('Inspector Daswani', "You lot again. I'd say this was a surprise, had Nate<br/>not already told me that he saw you earlier.")
('Inspector Daswani', "I don't know what brings you to Tharbad, but I'll<br/>keep my questions to myself for the time being.")
('Inspector Daswani', "We've got far more pressing business to attend to at<br/>the moment. Stay out of our way and we'll stay out of<br/>yours, understood?")
('Inspector Daswani', "I've reminded Nate time and time again that, as a<br/>detective, he needs to be prepared for work to come<br/>in at any time.")
('Inspector Daswani', 'I even told him we may well end up investigating<br/>Tharbad generally, soon enough. He has no one but<br/>himself to blame here.')
('Inspector Daswani', "You don't go into public service to be coddled.<br/>Either you get the job done or the public suffers for it.<br/>Period.")
('Inspector Daswani', 'Well, look who the cat dragged in. It seems we owe<br/>you once again for the information you supplied us<br/>with in this case.')
('Inspector Daswani', "I won't ask how you even came about<br/>that information. Right now, we need to determine<br/>the provenance of those orbal hookahs.")
('Agnès', "Is everything going to be okay with them? It sounds<br/>like they've spread like wildfire across the city.")
('Inspector Daswani', "We're managing. We, the local police, and the guild<br/>are all working together to confiscate them from<br/>every business in possession of one.")
('Inspector Daswani', 'Our official excuse, to avoid a commotion, is that<br/>they contain unauthorized ingredients, though some<br/>customers may be skeptical.')
('Detective Nate', "It's back-breaking work getting it all done! If the<br/>CID wasn't helping behind the scenes, I don't know<br/>how we'd manage this ourselves.")
('Detective Nate', "I guess with the folks who've already smoked, we'll be<br/>telling them a little more and following up with<br/>them later.")
('Van', "Glad to hear things with René and his people're<br/>going well enough, at least.")
('Van', "I feel a little uneasy about not doing more with those<br/>smokers, but I imagine you're pressed for time and<br/>resources here.")
('Risette', 'Indeed. I suppose we should consider ourselves lucky<br/>that the devices in question have not managed to<br/>proliferate outside of Tharbad.')
('Inspector Daswani', "Quite. With all of the Central Eastern VIPs here, this<br/>could've turned into an international incident if we'd<br/>been slower.")
('Inspector Daswani', "Believe me, as police, we wish there was more we<br/>could do. We're playing the hand we've been dealt as<br/>best we can.")
('Detective Nate', 'Great Goddess, I never expected things to take a turn<br/>like THIS!')
('Detective Nate', "I'm supposed to be out there enjoying the film festival<br/>with my girlfriend right now, and here I am doing the<br/>exact opposite.")
('Detective Nate', "*sigh* I'm in it deep now. I'm going to have to do<br/>something big to make it up to her.")
('Detective Nate', 'Oh, yeah! I heard you guys were the ones who<br/>managed to apprehend the Devancy brothers.')
('Detective Nate', "Not that this changes my opinion of you, mind you.<br/>I'm just glad we have one less hassle to take care of<br/>right now.")
('Detective Nate', 'When I got the emergency call, I was pretty irritated.<br/>But knowing that drug contamination is involved, I<br/>understand the urgency now.')
('Detective Nate', "Slipping substances into unsuspecting people's<br/>hookahs is no laughing matter. We're talking about<br/>public safety at this point.")
('Detective Nate', 'To think my girlfriend and I were going to smoke<br/>some of that stuff, too. Talk about dodging a bullet.')
('Detective Nate', "I don't care if the inspector authorized it. You can't<br/>just go around recruiting police officers as backup<br/>dancers for the parade!")
('Detective Nate', 'Besides, what are YOU guys doing, of all people,<br/>going around and grabbing dancers, huh?')
('Detective Nate', 'Nothing about this sits right with me! Hmph!')
('Detective Nate', 'Man, this was supposed to be an opportunity to get<br/>away from work and go on a trip with my first date<br/>in ages.')
('Detective Nate', "Graah! I swear, life just can't cut me a break for even<br/>a minute lately, it feels like!")
('Detective Nate', "Inspector?! What do you mean I have to get ready?<br/>...You're coming out to Tharbad tomorrow? But why?")
('Detective Nate', "I mean, yes, I get it's for an investigation. But why do<br/>I have to get involved when I'm supposed to be taking<br/>time off?")
('Detective Nate', 'I... I understand, sir, but... Augh, if you insist.')
('Detective Nate', "I'm going to receive additional time off later to make<br/>up for this, right?")
("Nate's Girlfriend", "Hey, Nate, honey? You're not doing what I think<br/>you're doing, are you...?")
('Detective Nate', "Sorry, babe! Duty calls! I've got work to do!")
("Nate's Girlfriend", "(So much for being serious, I gue—Wait, is he telling<br/>the truth? You're kidding me! That's not supposed to<br/>happen on a vacation!)")
('Detective Nate', "*sigh* Man, I didn't expect the inspector to show up all<br/>the way out here.")
('Detective Nate', "I'm supposed to be off duty, for crying out loud!<br/>And on a date, to boot! Can't he respect a guy's<br/>precious downtime?")
('Detective Nate', "You don't know how long it took me to get her to<br/>finally agree to this trip! I won't let you or anyone<br/>else ruin this for me!")
('Detective Nate', "Oh, great, it's the spriggan and his lackeys. What are<br/>you people doing out HERE, of all places?!")
("Nate's Girlfriend", "What's going on, baby? Do you know these people?")
('Van', "Relax, we're just out here on business. Sometimes the<br/>job takes us outta Edith. We aren't glued to the<br/>capital, y'know.")
('Van', "I'm more curious what you're doing all the way out<br/>here, Detective. Bit outta your jurisdiction, ain't it?")
('Aaron', "Guess our big city detective here's got some time to<br/>kill if he's able to take his lady friend down to the<br/>film festival.")
('Detective Nate', "Shut it. I'm off duty right now, so what's it matter<br/>to you? Besides, she wants to see the film festival, too,<br/>you know.")
('Detective Nate', "Just don't go causing me any headaches, all right?<br/>Last thing I need is you all getting in the way of<br/>my vacation.")
('Van', "Wouldn't it be easy to just pretend we're not here and<br/>go on with your date? You need to learn to chill out<br/>sometimes, pal.")
('Van', "Hey, buddy. How's your hot date going?")
('Detective Nate', "Don't call me 'buddy'! We are NOT friends! I'm not<br/>interested in shooting the breeze with you!")
('Detective Nate', "Oh, but of course, that doesn't apply to you, Agnès!<br/>If you ever need help with anything, I'm always happy<br/>to talk.")
("Nate's Girlfriend", "Little cozy with her, aren't you, baby? Talking to<br/>another woman while you're on a date with<br/>your girlfriend. Points for bravery, I guess.")
('Detective Nate', "Gah, uh, it's not like that, sweetie, I promise! I only<br/>meant I'd talk to her in my capacity as a policeman!<br/>There's nothing between us!")
('Agnès', 'Ahaha... Y-Yes...')
('Agnès', '(I thought we should try asking Detective Nate about<br/>the crooked policeman, since it is his line of work<br/>and all.)')
('Agnès', "(But if he's here off duty, then...)")
('Van', '(Yeah. Not to mention that he might not have much<br/>to say about that or the bootlegger in general anyway.)')
('Aaron', "(That's my thinking. Could end up being more<br/>trouble than it's worth in the end, talking to him.)")
('Feri', '(Yeah. Guess we better back off and look elsewhere.)')
('Inspector Daswani', 'You have some nerve lounging about while all of this<br/>is going on, Detective.')
('Inspector Daswani', "At least you're already here. Convenient. I'll be<br/>putting you to work until the film festival is<br/>over, understood?")
('Detective Nate', "You can't be serious! You want me to give up my<br/>hard-earned vacation time just like that?!")
('Inspector Daswani', "You're damn right I do. Emergencies don't have<br/>a schedule. Any detective worth his salt is always<br/>ready to act in an emergency.")
('Inspector Daswani', "Either you work now and crack this case, or it spirals<br/>out of control and you have even less time to<br/>fool around. What'll it be?")
("Nate's Girlfriend", 'What?! You dragged me all the way out here just so<br/>you can ditch me and go off to work?!')
("Nate's Girlfriend", "I finally caved in and agreed to do this after you<br/>badgered me so much and this is what I get? I don't<br/>believe this.")
('Detective Nate', 'Argh, did they really have to stick me between a rock<br/>and a hard place? I was hoping to enjoy my vacation<br/>and the festival in peace...')
("Nate's Girlfriend", '*sigh* From what I can tell, some big case is going on<br/>and the cops have dragged Nate in to help take care<br/>of it.')
("Nate's Girlfriend", 'I get that detectives can be busy. I can be patient and<br/>wait until his case is over.')
("Nate's Girlfriend", "But I'm going to have to talk to him later. I don't<br/>want him getting in the habit of leaving me hanging<br/>like this. It's just not fair!")
("Nate's Girlfriend", "I understand Nate's a busy guy. But did he really have<br/>to drag me all the way out here and then ditch me?")
("Nate's Girlfriend", "He should've told me this could happen sooner.<br/>Now how am I supposed to kill time while I'm out<br/>here all alone?")
("Nate's Girlfriend", "Are we even still going to be able to walk around the<br/>film festival tomorrow? I don't even want to think<br/>about it...")
("Nate's Girlfriend", 'This guy... First I catch him eying up the nightclub<br/>while he and I are supposed to be out on a<br/>date together.')

("Nate's Girlfriend", "This couldn't be much worse of a night out even if<br/>I tried...")
("Nate's Girlfriend", "At first I thought it was a bit early for us to be taking<br/>any trips, but the film festival's as good a reason to go<br/>as any.")
("Nate's Girlfriend", "Might as well have some fun now that I'm here<br/>either way.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Oh, it's you guys. Uh, thanks for saving me yesterday,<br/>you guys!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'When I got back, I passed out like a rock. I slept for<br/>so long, I was shocked to wake up and see the big<br/>festival was TODAY!')
('Van', "For someone who got kidnapped, you don't sound<br/>too worse for wear.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "You bet I'm not! A little shuteye was all I needed to<br/>make that anxiety go away! I'm as good as new!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Besides, I smell a big, big scoop waiting in this city,<br/>even bigger than I figured. Something's out there, I<br/>can just feel it!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "My business with Dingo can wait. I've got to get out<br/>there and do some digging!")
('Agnès', "Ahaha... You know, you're tougher than you look,<br/>Marielle, not losing heart after such a<br/>frightening experience. I'm impressed.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Of course! Hard-as-a-rock-ness is my middle name!<br/>Or my...five middle names. Anyway!')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "I'll keep hounding that guy for as long as it takes,<br/>until he changes his ways! I'll never give up!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Dingo seems to be pursuing a lead. Well, two can<br/>play at that game! I'll get my scoop and then he'll<br/>have to acknowledge me!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "With the prince and all those other bigwigs hanging<br/>around the hotel, there's just got to be something<br/>juicy waiting to be unearthed!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "I'll be honest with you, spriggan. I find it VERY<br/>suspicious to be running into you yet again, after our<br/>little encounter in Langport.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "It must have something to do with whatever Dingo's<br/>investigating, right? Right?!")
('Van', "Y'know, given that you never seem to get anywhere,<br/>don't you think stickin' to one spot instead of<br/>bouncing around would work better?")
('Van', "Anyway, to answer your question, we're here on some<br/>business for new clients. It's got nothin' to do with<br/>your hotshot heartthrob.")
('Van', "And, uhh, don't get your hopes up. He and I trade<br/>info, but nothin' that'd make for the kind of hot<br/>scoops you're anglin' for. Sorry.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Sh-Shut up! I don't need your help to do my job!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Mark my words, whatever it takes, I'll uncover the<br/>truth of what that man's up to, even if it kills me!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "We should probably call it a day, Dingo. But rest<br/>assured, I'll be hitting the pavement as hard as<br/>ever tomorrow!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "And don't think you can get the jump on me for long!<br/>No matter what you try, I'll be on you like a dog<br/>going after its own tail!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'When I said I wanted to put together something<br/>about the film festival, my boss let me go on the spot.<br/>It was amazing!')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "But you, Dingo, I can smell it. Films are just pictures<br/>and, uh...light, to you! You're after something bigger,<br/>something way more important!")
('Dingo', "*sigh* You really shouldn't put me on a pedestal.<br/>And now that you're here, we've got to keep you out<br/>of trouble.")
('Dingo', "Listen, I've got stuff to do. Don't do anything crazy.<br/>The prince of Elsaim is here, you know. Why don't<br/>you interview the guy?")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "He is?! I never would've expected someone so big and<br/>famous to be visiting a trashy event like this!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Yeah, maybe I SHOULD talk to him. That could be<br/>my ticket to a really big—Urgh, this isn't about me!<br/>Stop trying to distract me!")

('Shaheena', "Maybe it wasn't such a good idea to go up to one of<br/>the staff members and get up in their face.")
('Agnès', "Heehee, maybe. It's clear you want your sister to<br/>succeed, though.")
('Agnès', "We're definitely rooting for her, too. I'm sure she's<br/>going to do just great.")
('Shaheena', "Aww, thanks! Yeah, I know she's gonna knock<br/>them dead. It's Saara we're talking about!")
('Shaheena', "My sister's so amazing at what she does! I'm so proud<br/>of her.")
('Shaheena', "Hmm... Well, if I can't get in, now's as good a time as<br/>any to get some dance practice in, myself.")
('Shaheena', "Saara can't be the only one working so hard out there.<br/>It wouldn't be fair!")
('Feri', '(Shaheena sounds really anxious. Not that I can<br/>blame her.)')
('Van', "(Probably doesn't help that Saara can't perform like<br/>normal today or tomorrow. Hopefully all the<br/>excitement doesn't get to either of 'em.)")
('Shaheena', "I've gotta do something. My sister can't be the only<br/>one busting her butt today!")

('Bracer Ismail', "I've been looking into the new arrivals who are<br/>coming into the area from the Central East.")
('Bracer Ismail', 'So far, nothing suspicious has turned up about those<br/>coming from Elsaim, which means... Hmm...')
('Bracer Ismail', 'Either way, Tharbad is going to see an influx of<br/>tourists starting tomorrow. We have to optimize our<br/>intel gathering as best we can.')
('Bracer Ismail', "We can't expect our help from the capital to take care<br/>of everything for us.")
('Bracer Renton', "So far, there don't appear to be signs of any criminal<br/>organizations infiltrating the crowds.")
('Bracer Renton', "The fact they haven't turned up despite the festival<br/>already starting is disconcerting.")
('Bracer Renton', "At least we've got Fie with us. I guess we'll just<br/>coordinate with her and see what we can turn<br/>up together.")
('Bracer Renton', 'This morning has seen even more disturbances<br/>than yesterday. Some brawling even broke out a little<br/>while ago.')
('Bracer Renton', "The fact that the Edith police has dispatched<br/>detectives here says to me that they suspect<br/>something's going on, too.")
('Bracer Renton', "I'll let Ismail handle anything that requires more local<br/>insight into Tharbad than what I've got.")
('Bracer Renton', "As for me, I think I'll keep an eye on the trajectory of<br/>these tourists and where they're coming from.")
('Shadīn', "Well, the film festival's underway and thankfully,<br/>everything seems to be going smoothly, which is<br/>a relief.")
('Shadīn', 'I was really worried last night that those hookahs the<br/>police rounded up yesterday would have some sort of<br/>influence on people.')
('Shadīn', "You all seem more relaxed compared to yesterday.<br/>That's reassuring. I can rest a little easier today,<br/>I suppose.")
('Shadīn', 'I still have to take responsibility for my part, however.<br/>Any customers with a receipt will have their lost<br/>hookahs refunded by me.')
('Shadīn', "I... I can't believe my newest products were so<br/>dangerous to customers.")
('Shadīn', 'I really failed as a merchant not catching on to such<br/>issues before I bought them in the first place.')
('Shadīn', "The police haven't put any blame on me, which I<br/>appreciate, but I still feel terrible...")
('Shadīn', 'I have to own up to my mistake as a businessman,<br/>not only by helping the police collect them, but<br/>refunding people who bought them from me.')
('Shadīn', "I've had a lot of surprisingly demanding, angry<br/>customers this morning. It's a little overwhelming, to<br/>be honest.")
('Shadīn', "Some of them have the craziest demands. I've even<br/>had folks grumble about not being able to sell camels<br/>to them, of all things!")
('Shadīn', "I've worked as a merchant for a long time, and never<br/>have I seen as many complaints at my shop in one day<br/>as I have today.")
('Shadīn', "But sometimes you've got to put your feet to the fire<br/>to make a mira, so if that's what it takes to close those<br/>deals, sign me up!")
('Shadīn', "My shop attracts its fair share of customers because I<br/>deal in rarities that you can't find anywhere else.")
('Shadīn', "But even I can't ignore the real sales potential that<br/>these orbal hookahs seem to possess.")
('Shadīn', "If things like these are what's in vogue these days,<br/>then I need to make sure to pay attention and stock<br/>up accordingly.")
('Shadīn', "That's why it's crucial to interact with your customers,<br/>so you remain clued in to what they want, as they<br/>want them!")
('Shadīn', 'Welcome to my pride and joy! This outlet is the<br/>perfect place to see the prosperity of<br/>Tharbad firsthand.')
('Shadīn', "They call this place the City of Chances, and that's<br/>never been more true than it is right now with this<br/>boom we're seeing.")
('Shadīn', "Really, that sense of opportunity was there when I<br/>was still just a humble trader, and it's why I set up<br/>shop here in the first place.")
('Shadīn', "You can't call yourself a merchant if you're afraid of<br/>a challenge, and just look at me now! I'm doing great!")
('Shadīn', 'These orbal hookahs seem to be the latest fad. I had<br/>someone come in and try to sell me on them.')
('Shadīn', "There are other shops stocking them around here, but<br/>I'm not one to turn down a chance to make money, so<br/>I said 'sign me up'!")
('Shadīn', "After all, what good is a wave if you don't ride it?<br/>I'm more than happy to join the club if it means more<br/>mira for me.")
('Majelah', 'In addition to the police doing their mass<br/>confiscation, something seems to have happened at<br/>Vegas Films sometime last night.')
('Majelah', "Nevertheless, the film festival itself has commenced<br/>without incident, and we're seeing quite a range of<br/>customers, which makes me happy.")
('Majelah', "It's important to take advantage of events such as this<br/>so we can share the charm of our Central Eastern<br/>wares with more people.")
('Majelah', 'The police came by earlier and took a handful of our<br/>products away.')
('Majelah', "They couldn't possibly be related to the recent discord<br/>that's taken place around the city, could they?")
('Majelah', "I'll have to talk with the owner of this store. We need<br/>to be able to sell our gear as we have been, no<br/>matter what.")
('Majelah', 'Apparently some scuffles broke out around town<br/>this morning. The owner here is really concerned...')
('Majelah', "Normally, we keep real swords on display, but<br/>unfortunately we've seen a few too many customers<br/>lacking...self-restraint lately.")
('Majelah', "I think it's best we keep them in storage until things<br/>calm down, just to be safe.")
('Majelah', 'It may just be me, but people around Tharbad seem<br/>to be strangely elated as of late.')
('Majelah', "It's not just the tourists, either. Even local residents<br/>and other Central Easterners are in exceptionally<br/>high spirits.")
('Majelah', "It could simply be excitement for the upcoming film<br/>festival, but I've never seen anything like it, for<br/>any event...")
('Majelah', "Greetings! If you're looking for traditional<br/>equipment, Tharbad-style, you've come to the<br/>right place.")
('Majelah', 'For decades, connoisseurs have been captivated by the<br/>decorations and sleek designs that Central Eastern<br/>gear has to offer.')
('Majelah', "In particular, we've had a lot of discerning customers<br/>from the west pay us visits in recent times.")
('Majelah', "It's all the more reason to put my experience working<br/>in an Elsaim museum to use, and choose only the<br/>finest items to put on display.")
('Daskal', "I'm glad the film festival's still carrying on as planned<br/>and all of that orbal hookah stuff didn't turn into a<br/>big to-do.")
('Daskal', 'I was helping get the parade float ready, and that<br/>whole thing is shaping up to be more spectacular than<br/>I expected.')
('Daskal', "Our shop's partnered with the film festival, so I'm<br/>keen to do my part to make sure it's as big a success as<br/>can be.")
('Daskal', "I guess word's gotten out that those orbal hookahs<br/>were utilizing illegal ingredients. That's insane to<br/>even think about!")
('Daskal', "I've taken apart the heating element, but I can't say<br/>I'm well versed in the leaves themselves, so they sure<br/>had me fooled. Sheesh.")
('Daskal', "I swear, those orbal hookahs or whatever you call 'em,<br/>they just keep flying off the shelves faster every day.")
('Daskal', "The principle behind how they work is pretty much<br/>the same as what you'd find in something like an<br/>orbal heater.")
('Daskal', 'All they basically did was mechanize and shrink down<br/>the part of the device that heats up the water<br/>and leaves.')
('Daskal', "The hookahs're sold together with preprocessed<br/>leaves, which is convenient. Maybe that explains<br/>their popularity.")
('Daskal', "Way back in the day, I always had work fixing up<br/>orbal vehicles for caravans because of how often<br/>they'd break down from the sand.")
('Daskal', "But now that they're built to take such terrain, that<br/>work's dried up, which is how I wound up getting<br/>recruited to come work here.")
('Daskal', 'Being surrounded by cutting edge tech in such a<br/>clean, pristine workplace really hits home just how<br/>much things have changed.')
('Daskal', "Looking to tune up your orbments? Well, you've<br/>come to the right place!")
('Daskal', 'I know just how hard it can be to keep your gear in<br/>tip-top shape with all this sand, so why not leave it to<br/>a professional?')
('Daskal', 'I saw mountains of tired, old orbal machinery back<br/>when I ran a workshop in the Cultural District years<br/>and years ago.')
('Daskal', "Now that I get to deal in the latest and greatest tech,<br/>I feel like all that toiling away has finally paid off.<br/>It's great!")
('Receptionist Salma', "Thankfully, the police haven't had any major contact<br/>with us since everything that took place last night.")
('Receptionist Salma', "Our owner is doing a recall and offering refunds to<br/>affected customers. If that's the worst we have it, I'd<br/>say we got off lucky.")
('Receptionist Salma', 'At this point, I just want to help with the film festival<br/>so that our city can keep growing.')
('Receptionist Salma', 'How could a store like ours put illicit goods up for<br/>sale...?')
('Receptionist Salma', 'They were sold to us as being distributed by some<br/>well-known company running a campaign, and we<br/>just took them at face value.')
('Receptionist Salma', 'I know our owner can be impulsive to a fault, but I<br/>never thought it would lead to this sort of trouble...')
('Receptionist Salma', "I've already told you, please, keep your clothes<br/>on here!")
('Receptionist Salma', "We can do temperature adjustments on our<br/>air conditioner. Just keep your clothing on, I'm<br/>begging you!")
('Receptionist Salma', 'Shadīn, our owner, is a very decisive person and has<br/>a lot of drive as a leader, which I certainly respect.')
('Receptionist Salma', 'We might be successful right now, but being a little<br/>TOO certain about things can breed apprehension,<br/>you know?')
('Receptionist Salma', 'For example, I used to inspect new stock as it came<br/>in, but now that the company is all about<br/>speed, well...')
('Receptionist Salma', "Greetings! If you have any general questions, I'd be<br/>more than happy to answer them.")
('Receptionist Salma', 'The owner here does sales, too, so it falls on me, as<br/>secretary, to handle customer reception and<br/>offer guidance.')
('Receptionist Salma', 'In addition to featuring Central Eastern merchandise<br/>hand-picked by the owner, we offer specialized<br/>services by dedicated experts.')
('Receptionist Salma', "If you're looking for imported goods specifically, our<br/>owner will handle that directly.")
('Shayla', "Phew, looks like we're not gonna get charged with<br/>anything for smoking those orbal hookahs. I was so<br/>scared for a minute there!")
('Shayla', 'Now with that weird feeling out of my system, I can<br/>go back to enjoying the film festival like I was<br/>supposed to.')
('Shayla', "The shop clerk said we'd be refunded and stuff for<br/>our trouble, too, so, no harm, no foul in the end,<br/>I guess.")
('Shayla', 'What the hell? Where did all the hookahs go?<br/>And why are there are so many cops in front of<br/>the shop?')
('Shayla', "Oh, no! Don't tell me they were laced with<br/>something illegal?! Am I gonna get arrested for<br/>smoking them?!")
('Shayla', "Eeek! Nooo, I don't wanna rot in jail! They've gotta<br/>understand, I have tall, dark, and handsome actors<br/>to meet!")
('Shayla', "I dooon't even know what's going on anymore, but<br/>one thing's for certain: I'm on top of the world, baby!<br/>Wooooo!")
('Shayla', 'I better make the most of these vibes and see if I can<br/>land some hot studs!')
('Shayla', 'When life feels this good, like, who has time for<br/>nerves, right?! YOLO!')
('Shayla', 'We came here hoping to meet some celebrities or<br/>something, only to end up spending all day in<br/>that shop.')
('Shayla', "Oh, well. The film festival hasn't even started yet.<br/>There are still plenty of chances to catch glimpses of<br/>the rich and famous!")
('Shayla', "This stuff's amazing! Check it out, Laurel!")
('Shayla', "We don't have anything like this back home, not even<br/>in the fancy department stores!")
('Shayla', "These rare Central Eastern items are pretty pricey,<br/>but something tells me if I don't buy something now,<br/>I'll regret it...")
('Shayla', 'Oh, hey look! They sell portable hookahs, too!')
('Laurel', "Phew, is it just me or is it getting really hot? If this<br/>keeps up, I might have to start stripping and we<br/>wouldn't want THAT! ❤")
('Shayla', "Careful, Laurel! You know, in movies, it's always the<br/>saucy girl who shows a little too much skin who gets<br/>turned into shark meat first!")
('Laurel', "Haha, I'll be careful! Sadly, I don't think we're gonna<br/>be seeing any sharks in the middle of a desert.")
('Shayla', 'Well, girl, I have GOOD NEWS!')
('Shayla', "They make all kinds of shark now! Sand ones, snow<br/>ones, whatever! Nature's fiercest apex predator can be<br/>admired anytime, anywhere! Isn't it GRAND?")
('Shayla', 'Ahahahahahaha!')
('Laurel', "Things got so out of hand yesterday. I can't believe<br/>what I did...")
('Laurel', "Oh, what does it matter? It can't get any worse now!<br/>Shayla's not sweating it! I've just gotta roll with it the<br/>way she is!")
('Laurel', "There's only one way to turn this whole mess around:<br/>enjoy the film festival so much, I forget I ever<br/>embarrassed myself!")
('Laurel', "I overheard some of the shopkeepers talking earlier.<br/>Apparently those orbal hookahs aren't allowed<br/>or something?")
('Laurel', "You don't think they put any dangerous substances or<br/>anything in them, do you?!")
('Laurel', "Am I... Am I gonna be okay? I might've taken a few<br/>puffs, so I'm kinda worried...")
('Laurel', 'Aaah... This is greeeat. My body feels all warm<br/>and stuff.')
('Laurel', "Heeheeee, I don't have a caaare in the world<br/>right now. Should unwind like this more often.")
('Laurel', "Muuuh. We probably should've gotten out of that<br/>place a little sooner.")
('Laurel', 'Oh, well. I managed to snag souvenirs for everyone<br/>back home already, at least, so it was still time<br/>well spent. Ish.')
('Laurel', "Shayla, we're not here to go on a shopping spree!<br/>We came to enjoy the film festival and try to rub<br/>elbows with celebrities, remember?")
('Laurel', "Don't get me wrong, it's okay to let ourselves get a<br/>little distracted. But let's try to make our way toward<br/>Vegas Films later tonight, okay?")
('Laurel', "Although... I've gotta admit, I am a little intrigued by<br/>that orbal hookah. Hmm...")
('Manager David', "Looks like the big film festival's finally underway.<br/>For those of us in the leisure industry, it's a<br/>major event.")
('Manager David', 'Case in point: Mr. Gotti himself is known to<br/>patronize our fine establishment from time to time!')
('Manager David', "I can only imagine how the festivities are going to<br/>play out with his kind of luck in play. I'll be keeping<br/>an eye out!")
('Manager David', "A police officer just paid us a visit.<br/>Apparently, they're confiscating orbal hookahs due to<br/>some kind of issue that was uncovered.")
('Manager David', "I made it clear we don't deal in those sorts of things at<br/>my casino, but I can't deny some of our customers<br/>have smoked them.")
('Manager David', "Especially Mourad over there. I'm worried about<br/>him, he had quite a lot to smoke...")
('Manager David', 'Though frankly, smoking that much of anything is<br/>cause for concern, hookah or no.')
('Manager David', "I guess some fights broke out around town<br/>this morning. It's hard not to worry about where<br/>things are headed when it all gets less safe.")
('Manager David', "I'd best get in touch with the security company we<br/>have contracted out, just to be sure.")
('Manager David', "They're just as trustworthy as our own sponsors.<br/>If anyone can keep our customers safe in these<br/>uncertain times, it's them!")
('Van', "(Hey. Might be me, but when I think of security<br/>outfits that've pumped big money into the Central<br/>East, y'know who comes to mind?)")
('Risette', "(Oh, yes. He's almost certainly referring to Marduk.)")
('Risette', "(At the very least, I know there's a casino in the<br/>database that's funded with Valis money.)")
('Manager David', "Don't get me wrong. It's not that I don't trust<br/>Tharbad's police. But when you're a casino, you can<br/>never be too prepared.")
('Manager David', 'After all, we make quite a lot of mira, and our<br/>customers tend to be incredibly well off, to say<br/>the least.')
('Manager David', 'We can always count on nighttime to pick business<br/>up and land us some lovers of astronomical bets.')
('Manager David', 'But even by those standards, our customers have been<br/>unusually...eager, these last couple of days.')
('Manager David', "If our sponsors caught wind of the size of some of<br/>these bets, they'd be floored, and they're hardly the<br/>reserved sort themselves.")
('Manager David', "But that's just another side of this little desert oasis<br/>we call home.")
('Manager David', 'Welcome to the Moulin Casino. We hope you enjoy<br/>your visit.')
('Manager David', "While you're here, why not indulge in some games<br/>of chance? With any luck, you might be blessed<br/>with fortune.")
('Manager David', "If you wish to exchange your earnings, I'll gladly take<br/>care of that for you. It's honestly my favorite part of<br/>running a casino.")
('Manager David', 'As you can see, with the economy in such good<br/>shape, our customers have been betting quite<br/>big recently.')
('Manager David', 'Nothing like a good windfall to make people believe<br/>in the power of luck!')
('Manager David', "Why don't you all join them? Ride this wave of<br/>fortune and see just how far it can take you, too!")
('Harold', "Well, it's finally showtime for the big film festival.<br/>We in the entertainment business are going to have a<br/>lot to keep an eye out for.")
('Harold', "Personally, I'm really keen to see what kind of parade<br/>they end up putting on.")
('Harold', "I've heard murmurings about Mr. Gotti and the<br/>apparently outrageous surprises he has planned.<br/>But what they are is anyone's guess.")
('Harold', 'In times like these, when people let their guard down,<br/>you can really start to see their true colors.')
('Harold', "Take the film festival. A lot of people around here are<br/>getting really excited now that we're about to have our<br/>very first one.")
('Harold', "It's fascinating stuff to witness. Not unlike a good<br/>round of cards, in that regard.")
('Harold', 'I had the pleasure of playing against none<br/>other than Mr. Gotti himself a little while ago.')
('Harold', 'I have to say, I find his views on entertainment and<br/>how to stimulate audiences to be really fascinating.')
('Harold', 'I completely agree with him that nothing spices up a<br/>scene like a big surprise.')
('Harold', 'All the more reason to get excited for whatever that<br/>man has in store for his Carnal Cavalcade, if you<br/>ask me.')
('Harold', "When you work as a dealer, you learn that nothing<br/>gets a player worked up like a little zestiness they<br/>can't even see coming.")
('Harold', "There's no greater honor in this line of work than<br/>being able to deliver a good surprise your players will<br/>never forget.")
('Harold', 'Welcome. Care to play a round of cards with me?')
('Harold', "There's more to them than you might think.<br/>Once you get good enough, it's fun to see glimmers<br/>of your opponents' true identities seep in.")
('Harold', 'Oh, you must be the ones who were talking to Mr.<br/>Brad earlier. I take it you all enjoy a good card game?')
('Harold', "Of all the games out there, few can bring out a<br/>person's true self like a deck of cards. It's an endless<br/>source of fun.")
('Harold', 'I hope you enjoy some cards yourselves. Believe me<br/>when I say: nothing beats them.')
('Dealer', "Welcome! I'll be your card game dealer tonight.")
('Dealer', 'Harold had some matters to attend to and took off a<br/>little while ago.')
('Dealer', "For someone new here, he's actually quite the<br/>card shark. I don't know if I'll be as good of a match<br/>as him, but I'll try my best.")
('Dingo', "Ugh. That Marielle's got some sharp instincts.<br/>I hadn't said a word to her about my current story...<br/>and yet here she is.")
('Dingo', "Well, it's probably best I keep an eye on her.<br/>Guess we'll be going drinking tonight, though not<br/>too hard.")
('Dingo', "Marielle, I know I told you not to get involved<br/>this time... What? You're coming to<br/>Tharbad TONIGHT?!")
('Dingo', 'Give me a break for once, will you? Oh, all right.<br/>Hit me up when you get here.')
('Dingo', "I'll come pick your nosy self up at the station.<br/>Just don't stick your head into anything weird or<br/>dangerous while you're here, got it?")
('Van', "(Sounds like our intrepid reporter's on the case again.<br/>Don't get too carried away leading the poor gal<br/>on, Dingo.)")
('Bermotti', "Thanks to everyone's amazing help, I think I've got a<br/>real shot at winning this thing!")
('Bermotti', "Maybe I'll whip something up for old Dingo and his<br/>squeeze Marielle later, the cuties!")
('Bermotti', "There's two ingredients I want you darlings to go out<br/>and fetch for me.")
('Bermotti', 'The first is some red cactus. From what I hear, those<br/>grow where the sandstorm is at its nastiest, out in the<br/>dune-y part of the desert.')
('Bermotti', "The other is a type of pomegranate known as a<br/>'nocturnal sun.'")
('Bermotti', 'You might find some for sale somewhere out in the<br/>bazaar in the Cultural District, if you go<br/>sniffing around.')
('Bermotti', "I hate to call in a favor like this when I know you're<br/>so busy, but I'll love you forever if you do!<br/>Thanks, dolls!")
('Bermotti', 'Well, look who we have here! That was quite the<br/>exciting evening last night—for everyone involved!')
('Bermotti', "You know, I haven't seen those two tourists around<br/>the hotel since I got up today. Maybe I put the fear of<br/>Aidios into them.")
('Bermotti', "Not that I'm at all worried, what with you and<br/>Dingo around. Plus everything's as ready as can be<br/>with the side gig.")
('Bermotti', "Anyway, if you sweethearts need anything, I'll<br/>be here. Don't be a stranger!")
('Bermotti', 'You darlings sure seemed shocked to see me standing<br/>at the counter here, huh?')
('Bermotti', "That's not the only surprise I hope to have in store for<br/>you all, assuming all my practice for the bartending<br/>tournament pays off.")
('Van', "You're tellin' me. Never expected to see you hanging<br/>out with Dingo, of all people.")
('Van', "But far be it from me to complain about having<br/>you here! Don't be surprised if we hit you up later.")
('Aaron', "This bartending tournament sounds like a pretty fun<br/>time, too. Can't say I've heard of anything like<br/>that before.")
('Bermotti', "Oh, it's a thing, all right. It sounds like they<br/>deliberately timed this year's events to coincide with<br/>the film festival.")
('Bermotti', "Seeing as I was invited and all, I figured it'd be rude<br/>not to put in a good effort, you know?")
('Van', "So you're out here working a local joint trying to<br/>shake off the rust. I get it.")
('Van', "Didn't take you to be so serious about these sorts<br/>of things. Shows me what I know.")
('Bermotti', "I've got my connections in the bartending world, as<br/>you might imagine. It wasn't that hard to call in<br/>a favor.")
('Bermotti', "Regardless, I'll be training at the hotel starting<br/>tonight, so I'm sure we'll be seeing plenty of each<br/>other out here.")
('Bermotti', "One way or another, wherever I am, I'll always find a<br/>way to mix drinks. If you need anything, hon, don't<br/>be afraid to ask.")
('Bermotti', "When it comes to you, I'm always ready to prepare<br/>something spicy for you, whether it's alcohol<br/>or intel. ❤")
('Lester', "Well, the film festival is nearly upon us. It's a big day<br/>for us bartenders, too, you know.")
('Lester', "We've got our tournament going on today, as well,<br/>even if the film festival might overshadow it a little.")
('Lester', 'I met up with Bermotti earlier. He seemed perfectly<br/>relaxed and normal, not at all nervous about<br/>the tournament.')
('Lester', "I'm hoping to enter next year's tournament as well.<br/>I really need to learn to take a page out of his book<br/>and not get so worked up.")
('Lester', "A police officer came by a little while ago. Looks like<br/>they're out confiscating some kind of device<br/>causing trouble.")
('Lester', "There have been so many problems around here<br/>lately, it's hard not to feel like Tharbad's getting a<br/>little dicey.")
('Lester', "Not to mention, it's the day before the film<br/>festival, too. Who knows what's going to happen<br/>once folks start showing up.")
('Lester', "I've already spotted a number of people looking<br/>rather...merry, you might say.")
('Lester', "Most people would think they're drunk, but trust me,<br/>as a bartender, it's clear as day that's not what<br/>they've had.")
('Lester', "Alcohol doesn't cause people to lose their inhibitions<br/>so fast. Plus I couldn't smell it in their breath.")
('Lester', "Makes you wonder what the heck's going on.<br/>It looked unnatural, even given the excitement<br/>surrounding the festival. Hmm...")
('Lester', "If you're looking for Bermotti, he went over to<br/>the hotel. He said he was going to practice elsewhere.")
('Lester', "He wasn't here for very long, but it was an honor to<br/>get to host him at my bar. I learned a lot just from<br/>watching him.")
('Lester', "I can't help but admire his drive to hone his craft.<br/>Not everyone would move from place to place as<br/>they practiced. Kudos to him, I say!")
('Lester', "I can't believe Bermotti himself is entering the<br/>bartending tournament.")
('Lester', "You may not realize it, but he's a pretty big celebrity<br/>in our line of work.")
('Lester', "He said he wanted to get some practice in before the<br/>big event, so I'm letting him man my counter.")
('Lester', "I'll definitely be keeping a close eye on what he does.<br/>It's not every day you get to learn from a master<br/>like him.")
('Lester', "Most days, it's me who's tending the bar here at<br/>this casino.")
('Lester', 'I like to whip up cocktails that include rare Central<br/>Eastern fruit, which are a big hit among<br/>my customers.')
('Lester', 'Plus for my more well-connected clientele, I also offer<br/>an array of fine liquor from across Zemuria.')
('Mourad', "Give me a break! I went looking around this morning<br/>and can't find a single orbal hookah anywhere!")
('Mourad', "After setting ten million mira on fire last night, you're<br/>telling me I can't even get a smoke to haze out<br/>my sorrows?!")
('Mourad', "I REALLY could use something to take the edge off.<br/>Guess I'll have to make do with a regular ol' hookah.<br/>Ugh.")
('Mourad', "Argh, I can't withdraw any more cash! Fine! I'll have<br/>to use what I've got in my wallet to make back<br/>everything I've lost!")
('Mourad', 'All right, I got myself another ten million mira!<br/>Time to turn this into a payout for the ages!')
('Mourad', 'Hyeh! At this point, a bet like this is chump change!')
('Mourad', "What's a little extra now if it means that much bigger<br/>of a return later when I win it big, right?")
('Mourad', "Hey, what's with all the commotion outside?<br/>Oh, right, that whole film festival's going on, isn't it?")
('Mourad', "Screw all the pomp and circumstance, I'm here to<br/>have fun! And that's eeexACTly what I'm having<br/>thanks to this amazing hookah!")
('Mourad', "Bwahaha! I just know I'm going to win even bigger<br/>than I did yesterday! I think this calls for an extra<br/>big play!")
('Mourad', "Without that geological survey conducted by Valis,<br/>nobody would've ever known my ancestral lands were<br/>home to such rich mineral deposits.")
('Mourad', "It was me who made the call to bring them in.<br/>Best decision I ever made! Now I'm the owner of an<br/>enormous mine!")
('Mourad', 'Nice thing about working with Valis folks is they take<br/>you to resorts, too. Never hurts having likeminded<br/>friends who know how to go hard!')
('Mourad', "I'm glad I decided to visit Tharbad. This hookah's got<br/>a surprisingly addictive flavor, for how cheap the stuff<br/>in it is.")
('Mourad', 'Bahaha, they sure are raking it in over at Valis!<br/>Makes Elsaim look like a bunch of cheapskates<br/>by comparison!')
('Mourad', 'Never thought a developing nation would pony up<br/>nearly twice as much for ore as the principality, but<br/>here we are!')
('Mourad', "The future has never been brighter for my region!<br/>Owning a mine's not so bad when you've got help<br/>like that!")
('Amala', 'Could it be true the CEO of Vegas Films died last<br/>night because of what happened? There are rumors<br/>going around...')
('Amala', "If it is, that certainly paints everything in a strange<br/>light, especially the fact they're still putting on the<br/>film festival.")
('Amala', 'Something must be wrong with those hookahs. I saw<br/>police officers going around confiscating them.')
('Amala', "Not that I'll miss them, personally. It'll be interesting<br/>seeing how people react to having something so<br/>trendy disappear overnight, though.")
('Amala', "It'll definitely make it worth going people-watching<br/>at the film festival tomorrow, that's for sure.")
('Amala', "Some people seem to be puzzled about all the<br/>disturbances we've been seeing around here lately.")
('Amala', 'On the flip side, you might argue that everyone acting<br/>all flustered shows their true colors coming out.')
('Amala', "Everyone has ugly sides they don't want to show.<br/>Laying them bare is no laughing matter.")
('Amala', "It's been a while since Director Gotti paid us a<br/>little visit. Believe it or not, he's actually a fairly<br/>decent gambler.")
('Amala', "In case you couldn't tell from his films, that man's<br/>desires are bottomless. With a mind like that,<br/>gambling makes him play bold.")
('Amala', "But I guess without that sort of attitude he wouldn't<br/>be able to make the kinds of movies he does.")
('Amala', "Casinos are pretty fun places to visit, and I don't just<br/>mean for the gambling, either.")
('Amala', 'That part has its thrills, sure—but I get my real kick<br/>out of simply people watching.')
('Amala', "At any given moment in time, you've got a sea of<br/>souls mingling, many who'll go nowhere and some<br/>who'll go far.")
('Amala', "Like that dealer over there, the one in the glasses.<br/>He can intuit which type of customer he's playing.<br/>It's amazing stuff.")
('Rayhana', "The film festival might've still opened as planned, but<br/>everything's not so rosy under the surface.")
('Rayhana', 'After whatever happened at Vegas Films last night,<br/>some of the sponsors seem to be panicking.')
('Rayhana', "I hear they'll be making an official announcement of<br/>some sort. I've a feeling that, details depending, the<br/>casino will be implicated somehow.")
('Rayhana', "Hopefully the whole mess won't spell danger for<br/>Tharbad's leisure industry, but who knows?")
('Rayhana', 'The police paid us a visit a little while ago, asking if<br/>we dealt with orbal hookahs.')
('Rayhana', 'Some of our customers have been known to enjoy<br/>them, and apparently some sort of problem has<br/>cropped up.')
('Rayhana', "I don't know what the issue is, but whatever's going<br/>on, those cops looked awfully serious.")
('Rayhana', 'You might not think it, but the film festival is shaping<br/>up to be a learning exercise in how we run the casino<br/>moving forward.')
('Rayhana', 'Times like this, you can see shifts in our customer<br/>base and increased bet amounts, among other kinds<br/>of ripple effects.')
('Rayhana', "It's no exaggeration to say big events have a way of<br/>informing our operations long-term, as well as what<br/>new ventures we get into.")
('Rayhana', "We've always attracted a lot of Calvardian oligarchs<br/>and foreign nobles. One guy made his fortune from<br/>dealings with Elsaim, for example.")
('Rayhana', "But lately, we've been seeing a lot of newly rich<br/>Calvardians, plus people with close ties to Valis, too.")
('Rayhana', "And, as if that weren't enough, even Director Gotti<br/>himself from Vegas Films often comes here to play.")
('Rayhana', "He'd stopped visiting for a little while to work on the<br/>film festival, but was able to stop by today now that<br/>some of that work is behind him.")
('Rayhana', 'Welcome to the Moulin Casino!')
('Rayhana', 'Feel free to pull up a chair and enjoy our wide array<br/>of games. Or, if you prefer, we also offer a<br/>best-in-class bar as well.')
('Rayhana', "We've spared no expense whatsoever to ensure that<br/>you, our customer, have nothing less than the most<br/>pleasurable experience possible.")
('Rayhana', "Most bets tend to skew high due to our richer Central<br/>Eastern patrons. But please, don't let that stop you<br/>from enjoying yourself.")
('Rayhana', "If you have any questions about the games we offer,<br/>I'll be more than happy to answer them.")
('Rayhana', "Harold is the one who runs our card games. He's new<br/>here, but I assure you, he can certainly hold his own.")
('Receptionist Clammy', "I can't believe what happened to our president...<br/>What's going to happen to the company now?")
('Receptionist Clammy', "I doubt we'll go out of business or anything. We were<br/>still able to put on the film festival regardless.<br/>It's just...")
('Receptionist Clammy', "Our president's killer is still on the loose, too!<br/>I'm really worried how things are going to pan out...")
('Receptionist Clammy', 'President Dillon is somehow even more strung up<br/>than usual today, if you can believe it.')
('Receptionist Clammy', "Maybe he's just feeling on edge, what with all the<br/>turmoil the city's been dealing with lately.")
('Receptionist Clammy', "For my part, I've been ordered not to let anyone<br/>through unless he has personally authorized them.<br/>No exceptions.")
('Receptionist Clammy', "Phew. I'm beat. It's not often I'm working reception<br/>until this late.")
('Receptionist Clammy', "But on the flip side, we had all sorts of actors and<br/>directors come through that we don't normally<br/>see here.")
('Receptionist Clammy', "It's not every day I get to serve visitors like that!<br/>It's pretty exciting.")
('Receptionist Clammy', 'I feel kind of bad just sitting around and enjoying<br/>myself while everybody else is working so hard on the<br/>film festival, though.')
('Receptionist Clammy', 'Oh, hello! Is there anything I can help you with?')
('Receptionist Clammy', "I won't lie, I've got my hands full with people coming<br/>and going for the film festival, but it's all still really<br/>fun, too!")
('Receptionist Clammy', 'As a movie buff, I get a real kick out of seeing all the<br/>actors and producers from other companies who come<br/>to visit!')
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', "...Oh. If it isn't the gofers Nina hired.")
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', "I don't know what you're trying to dig up, but<br/>knowing her, I imagine it's rather serious.")
('Van', "Relax, pal. We're not here to get in the way of your<br/>little soirée.")
('Van', "Sure are workin' late, though. You know, for the right<br/>price, dependin' on what you're doing, I could maybe<br/>take a load off.")
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', "Hmph! Not a chance. Can't trust an amateur like you<br/>with this. Just don't go stirring things up too much,<br/>and we won't have a problem.")
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', "*sigh* As if I don't have enough trouble trying to<br/>keep a leash on Gotti and his rambunctious antics...")
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', "Now I've got to worry about grunts hired by a certain<br/>someone running amok.")
('Aaron', "Buddy, if you're so busy, maybe you shouldn't be<br/>stressing about what an actress does in her spare time.<br/>Ever think about that?")
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', "I don't like what you're insinuating. Listen, the last<br/>thing we need is one of our performers getting caught<br/>up in some mad scandal.")
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', "So it's only natural that I have a rough idea of what<br/>those ladies get up to, insofar as their agencies<br/>allow it.")
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', "In any case, if you don't have any business, I'll have to<br/>ask you to leave. I'm extremely busy here.")
('Van', "Hey, you won't hear us complainin'. Don't mind if<br/>we do.")
('Van', 'Just keep in mind that Arkride Solutions is in town.<br/>You never know when you might need us.')
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', '*sigh* Where did Gotti run off to this time? Does he<br/>have to go charging off at every damn foolish thing<br/>he sees?')
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', 'I told him we would need to have more meetings,<br/>and yet...')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "I'm supposed to start some intensive training to get<br/>ready for the Carnal Cavalcade.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "I'm just waiting for Director Gotti and the others<br/>to arrive. They were supposed to be here by now.<br/>Hmm...")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "*huff* *huff* Oh, Van! It's you.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "Everything's going just fine, I promise. The two of<br/>them are really considerate and doing a great job<br/>teaching me.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "Besides, I've got my sister to think of! I'm going to do<br/>everything I can to make my mark and be a real part<br/>of tomorrow's parade!")
('Director Gotti', "You kids did good finding me those extra<br/>cast members. Now it's up to me to whip 'em into<br/>shape and make them shine brighter than ever!")
('Director Gotti', "And it goes without saying, you can bet I'll be<br/>keeping a close eye on THAT young lady's progress<br/>in particular.")
('Director Gotti', "Don't get me wrong. I'm absolutely concerned<br/>about Saara.")
('Director Gotti', "But for now, all we can do is give it our all and put on<br/>the best damn parade money can buy. Trust me, you<br/>won't wanna miss tomorrow!")
('Director Gotti', 'Things are just about to wrap now that the big event<br/>is coming up tomorrow.')
('Director Gotti', "We've got to keep polishing things for as long as<br/>humanly possible! I want this parade to be nothing<br/>less than a masterpiece!")
('Director Gotti', "Heh heh. Now that some of our preparations for the<br/>festival are complete, I figured it's been long<br/>enough—I'll stop by and play a few rounds.")
('Director Gotti', "That dealer wasn't here the last time I came, but let<br/>me tell you, I like the cut of his jib.")
('Director Gotti', "He gets what it means to entertain people. He's good<br/>at throwin' in big surprises to his routine.")
('Director Gotti', "Hell, he's inspired ME to throw a little something<br/>extra into the parade to spice it up even more!<br/>Only question is what...")
('Director Gotti', "Haha! If there's one thing people crave, it's always a<br/>good shock to the system! Something stimulating!")
('Director Gotti', "If you ask me, nothing gets the job done faster than a<br/>little FnV: F****ing 'n' Violence, you know!")
('Director Gotti', "But I have to admit, if there's anything else out there<br/>that can prove just as stimulating, it's some good old<br/>fashioned gambling!")
('Judith', "Oh, it's you guys. I take it you couldn't resist sneaking<br/>a peek at our little practice session?")
('Judith', "If you ask me, out of everyone here, Saara's far and<br/>away in possession of the best dancing chops.<br/>No doubt about it.")
('Judith', "Probably doesn't hurt that Gotti wants something<br/>pseudo-Central Eastern, which has let her take to it<br/>pretty naturally.")
('Judith', 'Still, what the hell is he thinking, ditching us at the<br/>eleventh hour to go searching for more performers?')
('Nina', "Saara, try to smooth out the way you twist your hips a<br/>little more. It'll make you look sexier.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "Good idea! I'm sorry! I don't know why I didn't think<br/>of that.")
('Nina', "It's okay! There's nothing to be sorry about. I'm just<br/>giving you advice on how to look more attractive<br/>out there.")
('Nina', 'Oh, you know, it might work if you take it slow for<br/>that beat. Make it pleasing to watch.')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "O-Okay! I'll see what I can do!")
('Judith', "And there goes Nina, coaching away. She's not too<br/>bad at it.")
('Judith', 'Just wish I knew what that Gotti could be possibly<br/>doing, calling us out here like this.')
('Judith', "Just once, I wish he would put himself in our shoes,<br/>saying he'll join in once he finds those<br/>additional performers. *sigh*")
('Judith', "Hey, Saara, try swinging your arms a bit wider.<br/>It'll make it easier to transition into the next move.")
('Nina', "I'm shocked at just how quickly Saara's improving.<br/>It really speaks to just how good her instincts for<br/>these things are!")
('Nina', "She's already cut her teeth on Central<br/>Eastern dancing. That's more than half the battle<br/>right there.")
('Nina', "If she can clear just a few more hurdles, I think we'll<br/>be ready for tomorrow's parade with just a single full<br/>day of practice!")
('Director Lam', "So this is the new film festival that Gotti<br/>himself produced. It certainly looks like his<br/>handiwork, that's for sure.")
('Director Lam', 'That parade, in particular, is full of the, ah...sensuality<br/>that man is always hungry for.')
('Director Lam', "I'll be keeping a close eye on how well everything<br/>comes together as I mingle with my fans before the<br/>award ceremony.")
('Director Lam', 'Come to think of it, I remember hearing from the<br/>manager of Kowloon Pictures that something may<br/>have happened at Vegas Films.')
('Director Lam', 'Not that I intend to go anywhere near THAT subject<br/>until I hear what Gotti has to say about it himself,<br/>mind you.')
('Director Lam', "For all his brashness, I know he's a responsible guy<br/>deep down. I'll trust him and see how it pans out.")
('Director Lam', 'Hmm... This is a surprise, both Gotti and President<br/>Dillon being nowhere to be found.')
('Director Lam', "That's unfortunate. As something of a friendly rival<br/>of his, I was hoping to say hello to Gotti and wish<br/>him luck.")
('Director Lam', "Oh, well. I'm sure we'll cross paths at the festival one<br/>way or another...even if I have no intention of losing<br/>this year! Haha.")
('Agnès', '(Is that who I think it is...?)')
('Aaron', "(Yep. Director Leslie Lam from Kowloon Pictures.<br/>Hell of a guest list the festival's got if he's here.)")
('Van', "(The event's got the Lionne d'Or award for directors,<br/>that's why. Just about every director worth their salt<br/>will be attending for that.)")
('Van', "(Though given the film festival's all about<br/>entertainment, people are betting either Gotti<br/>or Lam there'll end up takin' it home.)")
('Director Lam', "Well, it'd be rude of me to wait around forever.<br/>I'll give him a little more time and if he still doesn't<br/>show, I'll head back to my room.")
('Director Lam', "Considering he's producing the whole festival, I can<br/>imagine he's incredibly busy right now.")
('Director Lam', "Perhaps I'll save our exchange for the<br/>award ceremony. That may well be the best time for<br/>us to sit down and talk.")
('Isaac', "I had a feeling President Dillon was always hiding<br/>something, but I never would've imagined he was<br/>working with criminals!")
('Isaac', "You could say I have mixed feelings about the way<br/>he died. I guess I feel sorry for him, but...it's hard to<br/>put into words.")
('Isaac', "Still, I can't help but wonder what's going to happen<br/>to the company and our employees once the film<br/>festival is behind us.")
('Isaac', "But...at least the show goes on. For now, all I can do<br/>is focus on what's in front of me and hope for<br/>the best.")
('Isaac', 'Our president seems really agitated about something.<br/>I wish he would spare a thought for his<br/>workers, though.')
('Isaac', "Doesn't he realize that adding on to the parade at this<br/>stage is a big ask? Give me a teeny little break, here!")
('Isaac', "Between you and me, I think this company got too<br/>big, too fast. It's lacking some fundamental things.")
('Isaac', "As if I'm not busy enough dealing with the festival,<br/>now I have to take care of pitches?!")
('Isaac', "I get that the one normally in charge has their hands<br/>full, but they want me to put summaries together and<br/>it's just too much.")
('Isaac', "It doesn't help that our president is sticking around so<br/>late, either...which is odd, for him.")
('Isaac', "That makes it tricky to do things on your own.<br/>It's like he's keeping watch over everything.")
('Isaac', "Gwuh. I'm so tired. I'm already occupied enough just<br/>helping out with preparations.")
('Isaac', "So of course Mr. Gotti had to come in and bark one<br/>of his elaborate orders at the last minute, which,<br/>y'know, that's great. Just swell.")
('Isaac', "Worse still, I've got President Dillon breathing down<br/>my neck, trying to rush everything.")
('Isaac', "And now they want me to take care of pitches on top<br/>of that. That's not even KINDA part of my<br/>job, officially!")
('Chief Manager Dianne', "I'm glad the film festival was able to start fine. I heard<br/>something happened over at Vegas Films.")
('Chief Manager Dianne', 'The festival sponsors and staff members staying at<br/>this hotel were all quite concerned.')
('Chief Manager Dianne', "The crown prince's own hard work was instrumental<br/>in keeping the festival on track. For our part, it's an<br/>honor to serve as the venue.")
('Chief Manager Dianne', "In light of the disorder this morning, we're working<br/>to bolster security at the hotel.")
('Chief Manager Dianne', 'Unfortunately, it seems we have some agitators<br/>among our guests here, particularly on the<br/>upper floors.')
('Chief Manager Dianne', 'The other floor managers and I plan to come up with<br/>a response to those individuals sometime<br/>this morning.')
('Chief Manager Dianne', 'Welcome! Please, make yourself at home and enjoy<br/>the services we offer during the day,<br/>and throughout the night.')
('Chief Manager Dianne', "In case you're not aware, this hotel was made possible<br/>by several investors, particularly Elsaim and the Bank<br/>of Edith.")
('Chief Manager Dianne', "Such investors expect only the absolute best in service,<br/>which we're proud to provide around the clock.<br/>Time is no object.")
('Chief Manager Dianne', 'We may be famous for our nighttime swimming, but<br/>our offerings extend well beyond that. We hope you<br/>make the most of them.')
('Chief Manager Dianne', "Welcome to the Al-Jumeirah Hotel. As one of the<br/>floor managers, we're honored by your visit.")
('Chief Manager Dianne', "I'm in charge of hotel services for both the first and<br/>second floors, as well as reception.")
('Chief Manager Dianne', "As such, should you need absolutely anything<br/>whatsoever, please, don't hesitate to come find me<br/>and ask. I'll be more than glad to help.")
('Receptionist Maawa', 'This hotel is actually playing host to two events right<br/>now: a banquet for film festival award winners, and a<br/>bartending tournament.')
('Receptionist Maawa', "Despite yesterday's goings-on, I'd like to believe we<br/>still managed to offer a superb venue for a<br/>successful festival.")
('Receptionist Maawa', 'In light of all the concern the festival staff and guests<br/>had until yesterday, we want to do our best to put<br/>those worries to rest.')
('Receptionist Maawa', 'Last night, after I heard a commotion coming from<br/>the pool, some guests came rushing straight<br/>towards me.')
('Receptionist Maawa', 'For reasons I can only imagine, one of them managed<br/>to lose their clothing. I kept my questions to myself<br/>and directed them to a tailor.')
('Receptionist Maawa', "Come to think of it, I haven't seen any of them<br/>all morning. I wonder what happened?")
('Receptionist Maawa', 'Welcome, Mr. Arkride, sir.')
('Receptionist Maawa', "If you're looking for Ms. Lanster and Ms. Fenly,<br/>you'll find them at the swimming pool.")
('Receptionist Maawa', 'You may wish to have a word with them as you<br/>relax together.')
('Receptionist Maawa', 'Welcome to the Al-Jumeirah Hotel. Ms. Lanster has<br/>already informed me of your arrival.')
('Receptionist Maawa', "She is currently staying in the upper levels of<br/>the hotel. Should you need anything, however, I'll be<br/>more than happy to assist you.")
('Bolhos', "Finally, the film festival's kicked off. As it happens,<br/>we're in charge of security for the festival grounds.")
('Bolhos', "Safety's not our only job, though. We're also expected<br/>to pitch in to make sure the event in general goes off<br/>without a hitch.")
('Bolhos', 'Of particular concern on our part is that airship.<br/>Prince Sherid clearly has high hopes for the success of<br/>this festival.')
('Bolhos', "Hrrm! All the more reason for us to give a hundred<br/>and ten percent and make all this a big success!<br/>We can't let a man of his stature down!")
('Bolhos', "I've heard there were disturbances around town<br/>this morning. Fighting, even.")
('Bolhos', 'Be that as it may, our mission remains unchanged.<br/>No expense will be spared when it comes to ensuring<br/>the safety and comfort of our guests.')
('Bolhos', "To that end, if you run into any trouble, please, don't<br/>hesitate to report it to me and my crew. We'll take<br/>care of it straight away.")
('Bolhos', "Hrm! If you're looking for the pool, you'll find it past<br/>the door at the far end of the right.")
('Bolhos', 'We offer a wide variety of services there as well, so<br/>please, take all the time you like to enjoy it.')
('Bolhos', 'Be aware, however, some of our guests of highest<br/>stature are there as well, so I must ask you all to<br/>exercise discretion.')
('Bolhos', "Hrrm! If you require any assistance, please, don't<br/>hesitate to call on me.")
('Bolhos', 'We currently have not only very famous actors staying<br/>with us, but also a number of VIPs hailing<br/>from Elsaim.')
('Bolhos', "Between the unprecedented number of guests visiting<br/>Tharbad and the increasing trouble, it's fair to say we<br/>are a bit under pressure.")
('Bolhos', 'Nevertheless! We want our VIPs to feel completely<br/>safe within our walls, and will respond to issues with<br/>the urgency they demand.')
('Bolhos', "Hrrm! ...Ack! There I go again. My apologies.<br/>I didn't mean for that to slip out.")
('Bolhos', "I've done some martial arts training in the past, you<br/>see, and I also work security for the hotel here.")
('Bolhos', 'Because of that, sometimes when I get into the job,<br/>that mindset from my training days comes back<br/>to me.')
('Peterson', "Our hotel will be hosting both the award ceremony<br/>and subsequent winners' banquet.")
('Peterson', "I hope I can be useful during it all. I want to show the<br/>winners my appreciation for everything that<br/>they've done.")
('Peterson', "I might not be able to enter the bartending<br/>tournament, but if I can serve the winners well, that's<br/>more than enough of an honor for me.")
('Peterson', 'Oh, right. Did you know that the bartending<br/>tournament is actually going to be held on the same<br/>day as the film festival?')
('Peterson', "My work at the hotel comes first, so unfortunately, I<br/>won't be able to enter, which is a shame. A lot of<br/>prominent people are entering.")
('Peterson', "Especially Bermotti. He came all the way from<br/>the capital! He's still practicing hard, even today.<br/>I admire his dedication.")
('Peterson', "That's probably one of the reasons why he stands<br/>head and shoulders above most everyone else in our<br/>line of work.")
('Peterson', "There's something fulfilling about serving some of the<br/>richer guests from the Central East, once you get used<br/>to what they order.")
('Peterson', 'They have their own particular demands you have to<br/>stay on top of, like fruits from there that they<br/>enjoy having.')
('Peterson', "It's an interesting challenge, grasping what they want<br/>and then trying to serve them something that meets<br/>those unique expectations.")
('Peterson', "It's a great opportunity to flex my muscles as a<br/>bartender, that's for sure. There's probably no better<br/>place to work than here.")
('Peterson', 'You learn a lot when you work at a hotel where the<br/>guests are very discerning about their alcohol.')
('Peterson', "I've practiced my craft all over the place, but I can say<br/>with confidence that this place is where I<br/>truly belong.")
('Peterson', 'After all, where else in Zemuria can I try my hand at<br/>mixing Central Eastern fruits and flavors in cocktails<br/>from all over?')
('Executive Director Suzanne', 'My workers finally calmed down this morning, but<br/>until yesterday, they were acting quite strangely.')
('Executive Director Suzanne', 'Post-film festival, water and orbal energy<br/>consumption is bound to go up. We need to be<br/>prepared to handle such a load.')
('Executive Director Suzanne', "We can't afford to disappoint our Central Eastern<br/>VIPs, in particular. This is only the beginning of<br/>Tharbad's growth as a city!")
('Executive Director Suzanne', 'I was just over at the office a little while ago and, you<br/>know, the workers there struck me as being<br/>strangely inattentive.')
('Executive Director Suzanne', "I'm sure some are simply excited about the festival,<br/>but that doesn't change the fact we're the ones<br/>managing the infrastructure for it.")
('Executive Director Suzanne', 'They really need to get their acts together. We have<br/>to be prepared for a huge influx of visitors while<br/>keeping things humming along!')
('Executive Director Suzanne', 'I mean, they were openly smoking orbal hookahs,<br/>right there in the office! That never used to happen.<br/>I expect better from them!')
('Executive Director Suzanne', 'I got a report earlier from our office in the Cultural<br/>District of water drying up in that area.')
('Executive Director Suzanne', "We managed to resolve the issue, thankfully, but it's<br/>embarrassing that it took us that long to realize what<br/>was going on.")
('Executive Director Suzanne', "We've had our hands so full expanding the<br/>Entertainment District infrastructure that I suppose<br/>we got lax about managing the water elsewhere.")
('Executive Director Suzanne', 'There are still things left to set up in the<br/>Cultural District. I want our resources to be<br/>distributed at least a little more equitably.')
('Executive Director Suzanne', "It's always shocking to see how much this city<br/>is growing. It's gotten so prosperous, I swear it looks<br/>different every time I visit.")
('Executive Director Suzanne', "As the one who runs Verne's infrastructure division, I<br/>stay informed about the size of the investments that<br/>get made here.")
('Executive Director Suzanne', "But you can't appreciate just how much the Central<br/>Eastern investors want Tharbad to grow, and the<br/>money they're spending, unless you see it.")
('Dahar', 'Hmm... It seems the film festival has kicked off<br/>without a hitch, which is a relief.')
('Dahar', 'When His Highness contacted me late last night, I<br/>was rather panicked about how things would pan out.')
('Dahar', 'Everyone, however, was of the same mind as the<br/>prince: the event had to go on. No ifs, ands, or buts.')
('Dahar', "Seeing as things seem to be staying on track, with any<br/>luck, I'll have good news to bring back home to<br/>the principality.")
('Dahar', "I'm relieved to see my daughter is enjoying the film<br/>festival, even if I have my reservations about that<br/>elder son of the Bashars.")
('Dahar', "Be that as it may, I don't regret bringing her along.<br/>This remains a good opportunity for her to learn<br/>about other families and the business.")
('Dahar', "The fact that Kaliyah has learned to speak her mind<br/>about things between our family and the Bashars<br/>shows how much she's grown.")
('Dahar', "That's all the more reason why I only want her to act<br/>once she learns how to protect herself, as befits a girl<br/>of nobility.")
('Dahar', "That Bashar is so full of himself, he's clearly lost sight<br/>of his own meager capabilities!")
('Dahar', "It's fair to say I was definitely right to be so cautious.")
('Dahar', 'That said, it genuinely pains me to see him, my rival<br/>of my many years, turn into such a mindless person.')
('Dahar', 'I can hardly believe that the head of the Bashars, who<br/>hold the eastern part of Elsaim, has been in bed with<br/>Valis all this time.')
('Dahar', "I knew that they'd been investing far and wide in an<br/>effort to spread their influence, but to witness it so<br/>close to home is a shock.")
('Dahar', 'I suppose this means the trade routes neighboring<br/>Elsaim have begun to fall under their umbrella<br/>at last...')
('Patriarch Bashar', "Well, what say you, Dahar? Haven't you tired yet of<br/>serving the royal family as its loyal dog?")
('Dahar', 'Hmph. Bold words, coming from the man who<br/>joined forces with a developing nation to complete his<br/>trade routes. And you call me the dog.')
('Dahar', "Unlike you, we haven't cast aside our pride as a clan<br/>and still remember the debt we owe to the<br/>royal family.")
('Patriarch Bashar', 'Bwahaha! Bold words, coming from one such as you.<br/>Perhaps you feel the need to profess your loyalty with<br/>him present?')
('Patriarch Bashar', 'The fact is, times are changing. I simply made the<br/>choice that best capitalized on the location of<br/>our dominion. Nothing more, nothing less.')
('Patriarch Bashar', 'These people are true visionaries, I tell you.<br/>Free yourself of those old shackles and face reality for<br/>what it is!')
('Dahar', "This isn't merely about mira. Elsaim has people like<br/>His Highness the prince and your very own sister,<br/>you know.")
('Dahar', "You'll come to regret showing such disregard for the<br/>principality, and you'll have nobody to blame<br/>but yourself.")
('Dahar', "What? Are you telling me you're meddling in<br/>the mines? After all this time?!")
('Patriarch Bashar', 'Bwahaha, there are plenty of other mine owners who<br/>have found great success with the help and support<br/>of Valis.')
('Patriarch Bashar', "Like it or not, the age of Elsaim's dominance over<br/>buried resources is coming to an end!")
('Patriarch Bashar', "Not only that, I'm confident that Valis will take its<br/>profits earned from southern maritime trading and<br/>invest them in land owners like myself.")
('Dahar', "That doesn't change the fact that those people now<br/>sit at Elsaim's doorstep with YOUR land under<br/>their influence!")
('Dahar', "How can you be so blind?! Can't you tell that you're<br/>merely being used for their shell games and<br/>nothing more?!")
('Patriarch Bashar', "Heh! And so what if I am? There's nothing that says I<br/>can't shuffle around their shells as well.")
('Patriarch Bashar', "I assure you, I have no intention of becoming<br/>their pawn. I'll make my fortune and then move on<br/>before they try to do me in.")
('Dahar', 'Such arrogance... Mark my words, a mindset like that<br/>will spell your doom, and sooner than later.')
('Kaliyah', "Anyway, Mundt Bashar says he'd like to be on, ah,<br/>better terms with me in the future.")
('Kaliyah', "I'm not...opposed. I was hoping you would agree so as<br/>to strengthen ties between our realms without<br/>conflict. What do you think?")
('Dahar', 'Hmm... So the rumors about the Bashar heir being a<br/>sensible fellow on the side of the moderates are true.')
('Dahar', "Certainly, I don't wish for this antagonism between<br/>our families to persist with your generation...")
('Kaliyah', 'Then does that mean...')
('Dahar', "Not so fast! We still don't know if this young man<br/>truly harbors good intentions.")
('Dahar', 'For all we know, this could be a ploy to allow the<br/>Bashar patriarch to ensnare our family and<br/>manipulate us.')
('Dahar', 'If Mundt has even a single iota of wickedness in his<br/>eyes towards my beloved daughter, I shall not allow<br/>him to get anywhere near you!')
('Kaliyah', "Erm. Father, don't you think you're being rude<br/>towards him before you've even—")
('Dahar', "This isn't rudeness, Kaliyah. It's diligence.<br/>Maintaining healthy skepticism is a part of living and<br/>working as a noble.")
('Dahar', 'We live in a world of conspiracy. You never know just<br/>who may be holding a knife behind their back, so<br/>to speak.')
('Dahar', "You must take caution against such forces and learn<br/>how to protect yourself if you're to make it on<br/>your own.")
('Kaliyah', 'This film festival is truly remarkable. And not just<br/>because you can meet so many famous Calvardian<br/>actors and directors, either.')
('Kaliyah', "The scale of the event is simply breathtaking.<br/>We certainly don't have anything like this back<br/>in Elsaim!")
('Kaliyah', "I can only imagine the parade will be even<br/>more magnificent. The organizers are certainly<br/>getting their mira's worth out of this event.")
('Kaliyah', 'I wonder what Mundt thinks about the film festival.')
('Kaliyah', 'Perhaps if he takes a liking to it, the Bashars will<br/>decide to invest in it next year.')
('Kaliyah', 'In fact, if we had a chance to meet because of<br/>business, that could allow our respective families to<br/>forge better ties...')
('Kaliyah', "Things never go so smoothly, now, do they?<br/>Still, I'm lucky that my father agreed to bring me to<br/>the festival.")
('Kaliyah', "In the past, he would never bring me anywhere<br/>abroad. He's changing a little, I'll grant him that.")
('Kaliyah', "Which means that if I can make myself just a bit<br/>more dependable, perhaps collaborating with Mundt<br/>isn't out of the question...")
('Kaliyah', "I've had the pleasure of meeting Mundt before, at<br/>certain events in the principality. He really is quite<br/>kind and intelligent...")
('Kaliyah', "Even if he sometimes shows rather...coquettish<br/>behavior, it would certainly be nice if our<br/>generation got along better than our parents'.")
('Kaliyah', '*sigh* Must the two sides always bare fangs at one<br/>another at EVERY possible opportunity?')
('Kaliyah', "Honestly, this was simply supposed to be a trip where<br/>we oversaw an event in which my father invested,<br/>following the prince's example.")
('Kaliyah', "I was truly looking forward to this festival, but who<br/>knows if I'll even be able to enjoy it now?")
('Kaliyah', 'There they go, bickering again. I thought we were all<br/>here to oversee the festival, and yet...')
('Mundt', "I guess they haven't seen each other since the prince's<br/>banquet two years ago. Maybe our fathers are just<br/>'catching up'.")
('Mundt', 'They were competitive back then, to be sure, but this<br/>definitely feels more...venomous.')
('Kaliyah', "...Forgive me for asking, but is it fair to say your<br/>father has, umm, 'changed' since letting Valis into<br/>your realm?")
('Mundt', 'You could say that. On the one hand, I can<br/>understand him not wanting to be held back by old<br/>customs for the sake of tradition.')
('Mundt', "But the fact is, once he sets his stubborn mind on<br/>anything, nothing can dissuade him. We'll see what<br/>happens, I suppose.")
('Kaliyah', "Be that as it may, that's no reason we personally can't<br/>get along. After all, we come from the same land.<br/>There's much we have in common.")
('Kaliyah', "Our generation can absolutely put the quarrels of our<br/>fathers to bed if we put our minds to it. Don't<br/>you agree?")
('Mundt', "Uhh, yeah. I don't see why not.")
('Mundt', 'To be honest, it makes me happy to hear you say that.<br/>Really happy, as a matter of fact.')
('Mundt', "Unfortunately, considering your family governs near<br/>Elsaim's border, I think conflict is inevitable.")
('Mundt', 'Not only does my father have a bone to pick, but the<br/>people in Valis see quite a lot within our territory.')
('Kaliyah', "Maybe so, but that doesn't preclude us from being<br/>friendly, does it? I, for one, don't want to have to<br/>quarrel with you.")
('Kaliyah', "...Oh, what am I saying? With the royal family and<br/>Valis at play, perhaps I'm naïve for thinking we can<br/>be above the fray. *sigh*")
('Mundt', "No, you're right. I think it would be good if we found<br/>a way to get closer and make it harder for our families<br/>to butt heads, long-term.")
('Mundt', "Though it would mean that if things took a bad turn<br/>between us, we'd stand to lose something.<br/>That wouldn't be ideal.")
('Kaliyah', 'Good point. Then in a few years down the line, we<br/>could get into business! Or become partners in some<br/>other venture!')
('Kaliyah', "We'll force our fathers' hands that way. Surely once<br/>they recognize it as fact, things can't get any worse<br/>between our families, at least.")
('Mundt', "Now that's an idea. I hadn't thought about that.")
('Mundt', "There's also... You know, we should discuss<br/>this further. I'm really intrigued by the idea of us<br/>going into business together.")
('Mundt', "(Hmm... I should've known she wouldn't quite pick<br/>up on it. Maybe we aren't quite there yet...)")
('Patriarch Bashar', 'Heh, I never had an interest in the entertainment<br/>industry, but I had to see this, knowing the royal<br/>family invested in it. And you know what?')
('Patriarch Bashar', 'This is far more amusing than I was expecting!<br/>Maybe I need to make similar investments myself!')
('Patriarch Bashar', 'But I can figure that out later. Right now, I need to<br/>make the rounds among all these wonderfully<br/>powerful visitors.')
('Patriarch Bashar', 'Heh heh! I plan to get plenty of dirt on the more<br/>spineless ones during this event.')
('Patriarch Bashar', "It's quite clear what direction Elsaim's and Valis'<br/>investments are taking.")
('Patriarch Bashar', 'If things go according to plan, it could be one step<br/>towards extending my business into Valis as well.')
('Patriarch Bashar', "Ha! I don't know when Mundt learned to think so<br/>cunningly, but I like what I hear.")
('Patriarch Bashar', "That's what makes the boy my son. If he grows up to<br/>be a shrewd ruler like his father, I'll be more<br/>than content.")
('Patriarch Bashar', "Feh! I haven't lost my mind. I know full well that<br/>Valis has ambitions of its own.")
('Patriarch Bashar', "But that doesn't mean a lord like myself can't make<br/>use of their, heh, 'outpourings' to my own advantage.")
('Patriarch Bashar', "A new age is upon us. Niceties are ultimately<br/>for suckers. If my family and realm are going to<br/>prosper, we've got to get dirty.")
('Patriarch Bashar', "Dahar is still stuck in his old ways.<br/>What good is having power if a man doesn't exercise<br/>it on others, hmm?")
('Patriarch Bashar', 'But forget him. All I care about is making my realm,<br/>and fortune, as big as possible so my son can inherit a<br/>lot from me.')
('Patriarch Bashar', "Actions speak louder than words. I'll show that Dahar<br/>that my way will bear fruit. Plenty of fruit, at that!")
('Patriarch Bashar', "Son, I understand what you're saying. But we can't<br/>resign ourselves to aligning with Elsaim, not when<br/>we've come this far.")
('Mundt', "I'm not saying we have to devote ourselves to them.<br/>We just don't know what the balance of power in the<br/>Central East could be later.")
('Mundt', "It's not good to put all of our eggs in one basket.<br/>Doing so could put us in a tough situation as time<br/>goes on.")
('Mundt', "Besides, there's more to our region than just Valis<br/>and Elsaim. There are plenty of smaller countries and<br/>unstable regions we could use.")
('Patriarch Bashar', "Bahaha, now you're thinking like a man! When did<br/>you grow up so much, my boy?")
('Patriarch Bashar', "All right, let's hear it. Got a plan for forging ties with<br/>Elsaim without pissing off our friends in Valis?")
('Mundt', "As a matter of fact, I do. It's going to involve a little<br/>bit of going back to our roots, one might say.")
('Mundt', 'As they say in the Central East, the ties between the<br/>clans are older than history itself.')
('Mundt', "So, with your permission, I'm thinking I could start to<br/>forge personal connections that we'll then leverage in<br/>the future. What do you think?")
('Patriarch Bashar', "You know, you might be on to something there.<br/>It's not like strategic marriages weren't common as<br/>dirt in my time, either!")
('Patriarch Bashar', "All right. Let's do it. I want to be clear, I still intend<br/>to prioritize working with Valis.")
('Patriarch Bashar', "But if you think you can make inroads with Elsaim's<br/>aristocrats, I won't stop you. Show me how far you<br/>can take this, son.")
('Mundt', 'Yes! Thank you, Father! We can discuss the details<br/>later once we get home.')
('Mundt', "This event is even more lavish than I expected.<br/>I guess I shouldn't have expected any less, what with<br/>the royal family's own money at stake.")
('Mundt', 'In fact, I heard that the prince himself has<br/>contributed a lot to the film festival.')
('Mundt', "There's probably a lot I could learn from him being so<br/>flexible in how he chooses to spend his wealth.<br/>Hmm...")
('Mundt', 'If I get the chance to meet him, it might not be the<br/>worst idea to have him advise me a little.')
('Mundt', "I'm surprised my father is so impressed by the<br/>film festival. He used to never care at all about the<br/>entertainment industry.")
('Mundt', 'A good bit of it probably just has to do with him<br/>liking glitzy things, but at the same time, it feels like<br/>we may be on to something here.')
('Mundt', 'Either way, hopefully this film festival will provide<br/>insight into how to go about collaborating with<br/>Kaliyah in the future.')
('Mundt', 'I really do want to forge a good relationship with<br/>Kary—I mean, with the other families. You know.')
('Mundt', "The way I look at it, if we build those connections<br/>now, that'll give our clan more options in the future.<br/>We have nothing to lose.")
('Mundt', 'Blast it all! I need to calm my father down, quickly!')
('Mundt', "If people see our families fighting at the film festival,<br/>our reputation will take a hit. He's actually not that<br/>hard to reason with.")
('Mundt', "Ultimately, it's our future that's most important, not<br/>what's immediately in front of us!")
('Mundt', 'The Bashars and Dahars have been rival clans<br/>practically since the beginning of time.')
('Mundt', "Not that we typically resort to arms to settle<br/>our differences. In fact, we've crossed paths before at<br/>royal functions.")
('Mundt', "But with my father getting roped into Valis' financial<br/>schemes, the situation has gotten a<br/>little...complicated.")
('Berthier', 'Gah, I am so nervous now. I was feeling weirdly<br/>optimistic yesterday, but not anymore!')
('Berthier', "Probably because it's the big day. I don't know how I<br/>was able to relax around the hotel yesterday like it<br/>was nothing.")
('Berthier', "Oh, well. It is what it is. Now it's up to me to be<br/>strong and get out there into the festival!")
('Berthier', "Mr. Gotti's whole 'scintillating spectacle' philosophy<br/>might look like mindless fluff, but he actually puts a<br/>lot of thought into his work.")
('Berthier', "I was the actress who played the researcher that faints<br/>first thing in his movie 'Golden Blood.'")
('Berthier', 'He was extremely particular about how exposing my<br/>lab coat should be, how my legs should be crossed,<br/>even the mussiness of my hair.')
('Berthier', 'Although...I gotta admit, having him barking orders<br/>at me and posing while I was lying on the floor was<br/>more than a little awkward.')
('Berthier', "Nina is so awesome. It's amazing how hard she can<br/>get into her roles.")
('Berthier', "I played a supporting role with her in<br/>'Wolves' Requiem.'")
('Berthier', "I'm telling you, it was like her character, Michelle,<br/>was really alive and standing right next to me the<br/>entire time!")
('Berthier', "You probably know, but Nina plays Sheena Dirke in<br/>the upcoming movie 'Gloria.'")
('Berthier', 'She made a real stir in the film industry, being able to<br/>play such a prominent white figure so naturally<br/>despite being half-Eastern.')
('Berthier', "If she can pull off something as tricky as that, who<br/>knows how much potential she has? Seriously,<br/>it's nuts!")
('Berthier', 'I never imagined a second-rate actress like me would<br/>ever get to stay in such a fancy hotel...')
('Berthier', "I've been to other film festivals before, but never got<br/>to hang out in anything like this. I mean, JUDITH<br/>LANSTER is here!")
('Berthier', "Sounds like there are plenty of other A-listers<br/>here, too. Maybe if I'm lucky, I can get some pointers<br/>from them. That would be great!")
('Berthier', 'I wonder if anyone like Lapharl Aznavour is staying<br/>at this place? Hmm...')
('Marcello', "Don't be shy! Step right up! You're gonna love what I<br/>have for sale!")
('Marcello', "Better act fast, though! I'm only getting<br/>more customers! This stall's as popular as ever!")
('Marcello', "Shit! Wait, you guys aren't—")
('Agnès', "Hmm? We aren't what?")
('Marcello', 'N-Never mind. Looks like I was mistaken.')
('Marcello', "Heh, the more I think about it, there's no way a cutie<br/>like you would be one of THEM anyway.")
('Feri', "What do you mean, 'one of them'?")
('Van', '(I think I might know what he means. Might wanna<br/>check the bulletin board for any new jobs.)')
('Marcello', "Maybe it's just me, but I swear I keep seeing cops<br/>around more often than usual.")
('Marcello', "That probably won't make your guys' job of finding<br/>the right one any easier, but please, you've gotta<br/>help me!")
('Marcello', "*sigh* Anyway, back to work, I suppose. This stuff<br/>ain't gonna sell itself.")
('Marcello', "I really don't want nothing to do with any cops, so I<br/>intend to just stay low as best I can while I keep doing<br/>my thing.")
('Juliana', "People were speculating they might have to cancel the<br/>parade after what happened, but nope, sounds like<br/>that won't be the case!")
('Juliana', "I won't complain. It's been nothing but bad news<br/>lately, so you can bet I'll be out there, living it up and<br/>enjoying today to the fullest!")
('Juliana', "I've been working so hard getting ready for<br/>today, too.")
('Juliana', "Once I'm done smoking this, I'm going to head off<br/>and prep for the parade!")
('Juliana', 'Everybody in the club was completely freaking out<br/>about those orbal hookahs turning out to be<br/>so terrible.')
('Juliana', 'Especially the popular girls. I guess they had spendy<br/>regulars who liked to indulge in the stuff.')
('Juliana', "I've always been the type to just stick to my one<br/>favorite flavor, and this time it saved my hide!")
('Juliana', 'Last thing I needed is my skin going bad on me, the<br/>day before the big parade!')
('Juliana', "I can't believe I get to have Mr. Gotti himself watch<br/>me dance! You can't make these things up!")
('Juliana', "Pole dancing is my forte, and you can be sure I'll be<br/>busting my butt to knock a guy like him off his feet!")
('Juliana', "I decided to come over to work 'cause I was feeling<br/>bored at home, so imagine my luck!")
('Juliana', "It's an honor just to get to meet Mr. Gotti, but to be<br/>invited to work in his parade? Wow!")
('Juliana', "I've gotta redo my makeup! This is serious now!")
('Caravan Chief Osman', 'My lost camel is somewhere out in the Sandsea.')
('Caravan Chief Osman', "It's not just its safety I'm worried about. It's carrying<br/>valuable goods, too. I'm worried what could happen<br/>to them.")
('Caravan Chief Osman', "I really hate to impose, but I hope you can bring<br/>it back! I don't know what I'll do without it!")
('Director Gotti', 'Listen! Judith Lanster and Nina Fenly! Those two<br/>ladies are a must, you hear me?!')
('Director Gotti', 'The guys, you can hire any old schmucks for! Just do<br/>what it takes to get those two on board!')
(40301, 'B-But, sir...')
(40302, "You're talking about two of the biggest stars in<br/>the business! There's no way we could book one of<br/>them, let alone BOTH!")
('Director Gotti', "You can and you will! You're a pro, aren'cha?<br/>Act like one!")
('Director Gotti', "Screw the budget and set the schedule on fire if you<br/>have to! As long as we've got Judith and Nina, we can<br/>sort it all out later.")
('Director Gotti', "If anything goes awry, I'll take full responsibility!<br/>So don't you worry about a thing—just go out there<br/>and get it done!")
(40301, "Sir, I don't think a can-do attitude is going to cut it<br/>for this!")
('Prince Sherid', "Well...someone's as passionate as ever.")
('Director Gotti', 'Ah! Prince Sherid! Fancy seeing you here!')
('Prince Sherid', 'Clearly, I brought on the right man for the job.')
('Prince Sherid', 'I can already tell that this film festival of ours is going<br/>to be one for the history books.')
('Prince Sherid', 'And not just the festival itself. The parade seems to<br/>be shaping up to be even more exciting than<br/>I imagined.')
('Director Gotti', "Bwahaha! Your event's in good hands,<br/>Your Highness!")
('Director Gotti', "I'll make this film festival hotter than anything they<br/>ever put on in Messeldam if it's the last thing I do!")
('Director Gotti', "People don't want pomp and circumstance!<br/>They won't touch that crap with a ten-arge pole!")
('Director Gotti', "No, what matters in movies is entertainment!<br/>I'm talking FnV: F***ing 'n' Violence, baby!")
('Prince Sherid', "Director, I believe it would be more appropriate to<br/>call it a 'scintillating spectacle', yes?")
('Director Gotti', 'Whoops! Slip of the tongue!<br/>Gahahaha!')
('Prince Sherid', 'Hahahaha!')
('Naje', '...Your Highness, please, restrain yourself.')
('Director Gotti', "Ah, speaking of which! My dear Naje, I don't<br/>suppose I could persuade you to take part in our<br/>humble parade, could I?")
('Director Gotti', "Your talent is otherworldly! It'd be a waste not to put<br/>it to good use!")
('Prince Sherid', 'Yes, that it would be. What say you, Naje? If you<br/>wish, you may—')
('Naje', "My prince, if you get carried away, I won't hesitate to<br/>report you to your sister.")
('Prince Sherid', "Ah, well, that won't be necessary! It was a jest, I<br/>assure you!")
('Prince Sherid', "Isn't that so, Mr. Gotti? Now, about the<br/>other candidates...")
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', 'Give me a break. Just how long will those two keep<br/>up that nonsense?')
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', "Gotti's popularity makes him a useful asset, but he<br/>and that prince are nearly impossible to control.")
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', 'Oh, well. The film festival has made it this far.<br/>Might as well use it to expand our market share<br/>and—')
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', '...!')
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', 'Of all the times, why now?!')
(500, 'October 5th, 8:02AM')
('Agnès', 'Wow! A waterfall in the middle of town?!')
('Feri', "Pretty wild, right? Apparently, the water's pumped in<br/>straight from the oasis.")
('Aaron', 'Looks like a lot of tourists running around here.<br/>Anyway, where am I parking this bad boy?')
('Van', "*yawn* Take a right 'n' pull into the big parking lot.<br/>I got us a spot booked there.")
('Aaron', 'Will do!')
('Van', 'Nnngh... Here at last.')
('Agnès', 'Van, are you going to be all right? You only slept for<br/>an hour.')
('Van', "Ehh, I'll manage. Used to it at this point.")
('Van', "You can sure tell we're in the desert, though.<br/>Barely morning and it's already hotter than Gehenna.")
('Feri', "It's only gonna get hotter throughout the day, too.<br/>And then nighttime hits and the temperature crashes<br/>like a bus.")
('Aaron', "We're meeting our client at noon, yeah? What say we<br/>cool off at the casino?")
('Van', 'Yeah, in your dreams, kid. We need to check in to<br/>the inn first.')
('Van', "Once we drop off our luggage, it'll be time for us to<br/>limber up.")
('Agnès', "The place we're staying at is in the Cultural<br/>District, right?")
('Van', 'Yeah. If memory serves, it should be...')
('Feri', 'We want to go that way, then!')
('Aaron', "Then what're we waiting for? Let's get to it.")
('Agnès', "This looks like the Entertainment District. It's still<br/>pretty new. I think it opened only a decade or so ago.")
('Agnès', 'It certainly is bustling.')
('Feri', "For real! Last time I was here, there weren't this<br/>many people.")
('Van', "Ain't just Calvardian tourists, either. Lots of folks<br/>comin' in from the Central East, by the look of it.")
('Van', "This festival's shapin' up to be even bigger than<br/>Messeldam's—'specially with that parade they're<br/>puttin' on.")
('Feri', "Yeah! I'm excited!")
('Aaron', "Look, I got nothing against a good festival or parade.<br/>But if you ask me, the real excitement's in that casino,<br/>so—")
('Van', "We're not going gambling, punk. Not like we've got<br/>that much time to kill, anyway.")
('Agnès', "Let's make our way to the hotel. After that, we can<br/>walk around and do some shopping.")
('Aaron', 'Tch. Nobody knows how to have fun around here.')
('Agnès', 'The Al-Jumeirah Hotel... Just looking at it<br/>is breathtaking.')
('Feri', 'Tell me about it. Last time I was here, I only got to<br/>check out the observation deck!')
('Aaron', "This place screams celebrities and millionaires.<br/>Wouldn't mind staying here once, just to see what<br/>it's like.")
('Van', "Not on our budget. A night here can easily cost more<br/>than the office rent if we ain't careful.")
('Aaron', 'I bet.')
('Feri', 'Is it seriously that much?')
('Agnès', "It's definitely a place for those who have more money<br/>than they know what to do with.")
(40301, 'Hrrm! Welcome to the Al-Jumeirah Hotel.')
(40301, "I take it you're Van Arkride and his companions?<br/>We've been expecting you.")
(40301, 'Our guest is waiting for you. Please, follow me.')
('Agnès', 'Okay, lead the way.<br/>(That was an unusual greeting...)')
('Van', "Thanks. Glad you're already filled in.<br/>(Yeah, just ignore it and move on.)")
('System', "Van and the others were taken to a guest room<br/>located in the hotel's upper echelons.")
('Nina', 'Hey, everyone. Thanks for taking the time to come<br/>all the way out here.')
('Nina', 'You must be exhausted after such a long drive.')
('Van', "Nah. It's good to go on a road trip every once in<br/>a while.")
('Feri', "Your trip must've been pretty tiring here, too.<br/>Did you take an airship from Edith to get here?")
('Nina', 'Mm-hmm! I only got here just a bit ago.')
('Nina', "And I don't believe we've met yet, have we?")
('Agnès', "No, we haven't. It's nice to meet you! I'm<br/>Agnès Claudel. I work as Van's part-time assistant.")
('Agnès', "It's a real honor to meet you, Nina! I loved 'Along the<br/>Sea Breeze.'")
('Nina', "Really? I'm flattered. That was my very first film,<br/>you know.")
('Van', 'Oh, I remember that one. Kinda plain, but the<br/>camera work was stellar. Real emotive stuff.')
('Van', 'In a way, the fact that you never overpowered any<br/>scene you were in made you stand out even more.<br/>I liked it.')
('Nina', "Oh, my! I never would've guessed you'd seen it,<br/>too, Van.")
('Agnès', 'Neither would I. Do you watch a lot of romantic<br/>movies, Van?')
('Van', "Sure. I'll watch just about any kinda movie.")
('Feri', 'There are romance movies? I wonder if you need to<br/>be older to watch them...')
('Aaron', "You're just full of surprises, huh? First I hear you've<br/>got a sweet tooth, and now this. Guess you're not as<br/>tough as you look.")
('Van', 'Aww, shut up! A guy can be tough and like whatever<br/>he wants!')
('Judith', "Hey, Nina! I'm coming in.")
('Judith', "Heard some chatter in there. I'm guessing they're<br/>all here?")
('Judith', "I still don't understand what in the world...you...")
('Nina', 'Hi, Judith. Perfect timing.')
('Agnès', 'Err... Well...this is a surprise.')
('Aaron', 'Hold the—is that THE Judith Lanster? In the flesh?!')
('Feri', '...Uh.')
('Judith', 'Y-You all are—')
('Van', "We're with Arkride Solutions, ma'am. I'm Van<br/>Arkride, head honcho.")
('Van', 'You must be the other client Nina mentioned?<br/>Pleasure doing business with you.')
('Agnès', '...That was a really amazing lunch. Thank you!')
('Aaron', 'First-class joint like this, you definitely get what you<br/>pay for.')
('Feri', "I'm pretty new to all of this, but it sure was tasty,<br/>whatever it was!")
('Van', "So rich, and a great sweet aftertaste... The camel's<br/>milk in this is better than I could've imagined!")
('Van', "And the flavor from that fresh cacao! It's a damn<br/>tragedy you can only get the stuff locally.")
('Van', 'We really are in a desert oasis. Hell, better than that!<br/>An actual Shangri-La!')
('Aaron', 'Give it a rest already, will you?')
('Agnès', "Don't mind him. You'll get used to it soon enough.")
('Nina', "I'm glad you like the cake so much! Judith and I are<br/>both big fans of it, too.")
('Nina', "Actually, speaking of which, what's wrong, Judith?<br/>You've been so quiet.")
('Nina', "You haven't eaten very much at all, either. You're not<br/>coming down with something, are you?")
('Judith', "What? No, I'm fine! Couldn't be better, in fact.")
('Judith', "Never mind me. Now that lunch is over, let's get to<br/>the topic at hand.")
('Judith', "Nina has more or less filled me in on what's going on.<br/>I know of your work. Or, what you do as a spriggan,<br/>to be more precise.")
('Judith', "Word's gotten around about you.")
('Judith', 'But should we really be paying out of our pockets to<br/>ask you people to handle such an assignment?')
('Van', '...')
('Nina', 'Judith, are we really going to have this<br/>conversation again?')
('Judith', "Look, I'm not saying I doubt your intuition. But we<br/>have to consider our positions as celebrities!")
('Judith', "That...Dingo Brad, was it? He seems trustworthy<br/>enough as a reporter, I'll grant that.")
('Judith', 'But if things go south, the scandal could be awful.')
('Nina', 'Sure, but...')
('Aaron', "That's a big-time star for you. Keeping up<br/>appearances is priority number one.")
('Aaron', "I mean, I get it. It can't exactly be the easiest thing,<br/>calling in a favor to people who live and work in<br/>society's underbelly.")
('Aaron', "But if I had to guess, there's probably a reason you'd<br/>rather not get the Bracer Guild involved, either, yeah?")
('Judith', 'Mrr...')
('Van', '(Guess that hit the nail on the head.)')
('Feri', '(Sure looks like it.)')
('Agnès', '...?')
('Nina', "Umm, to be clear, there's nothing shady or scandalous<br/>going on with us specifically.")
('Nina', "It's just...the entertainment world is a small one.<br/>We can't rule out the chance that this is harassment<br/>from someone in the industry.")
('Nina', "But if we turn to the police or the guild, it's bound to<br/>go public, so...")
('Agnès', "I understand. If it isn't a serious crime, you would<br/>rather settle things privately. Is that it?")
('Judith', "Yeah, that's it exactly! Thank Aidios someone<br/>here understands.")
('Aaron', "Uhh, I think we all got the idea. What isn't adding<br/>up is why WE are such a big problem, helpwise.")
('Aaron', "The way you keep going on, if anybody's suspicious<br/>here, it's you.")
('Van', "(Now we're gettin' somewhere. Aaron knows how to<br/>cut through things in his own way.)")
('Judith', 'W-Well...nobody said anything about you bringing<br/>any girls along!')
('Judith', "You wouldn't know, but last time I saw you, you were<br/>putting them in serious danger by—")
('Nina', "Wait, I'm confused. Do you know these people?")
('Agnès', "No, we don't...?<br/>(Could she be talking about the film screening?)")
('Aaron', '...')
('Judith', "...Not really. I just happened to see them at a<br/>showing, that's all.")
('Judith', 'All right, fine. It certainly SEEMS like you guys<br/>know how to handle yourselves in a rough situation.')
('Judith', 'But how good are you at tracking down culprits and<br/>uncovering things quietly, hmm?')
('Feri', 'I mean...')
('Agnès', 'If we had to say...')
('Van', 'You know, before we got here, we took a bit of a<br/>stroll around town.')
('Van', 'There was something that struck me as odd.')
('Judith', '...?')
('Nina', 'Odd? Like what?')
('Van', 'Lemme ask you guys something.')
('Van', "Now that we've walked around a little, did you notice<br/>anything that's changed? Or anything that stuck out?")
('Aaron', "If I didn't know better, I'd say you're off your rocker.<br/>But in this case...")
('Feri', 'Yeah. Now that you mention it, Tharbad feels a lot<br/>more...rambunctious than when I was here last time.')
('Agnès', '(If I had to put into words what felt off, it<br/>would be...)')
('Agnès', "(Hmm... No, that's not it.)")
('Agnès', "(I'm pretty sure this must be what Van's<br/>talking about...)")
('Agnès', "You're talking about all the commotion around here,<br/>aren't you?")
('Agnès', "There's a big film festival starting soon, it's true.<br/>But people seem to be getting a little carried away,<br/>even beyond that.")
('Nina', 'Really?')
('Judith', 'What do you mean, exactly?')
('Aaron', "Think about it like this: they're still getting<br/>everything ready, right? It's not even time for the<br/>main event.")
('Aaron', 'But what was the first thing we saw when we got here<br/>this morning? That this place is as busy as Langport.<br/>At happy hour.')
('Aaron', 'Not to mention the guys who tried to start something<br/>with those sisters.')
('Feri', "It definitely feels like there's something in the air.<br/>Like...people are more prone to getting into fights.")
('Agnès', "I think so, too, even if I don't understand why.")
('Agnès', "It's possible it's related to this assignment<br/>somehow, though.")
('Nina', "...Huh. That's interesting.")
('Judith', '...')
('Van', "That's just the tip of the iceberg, though.<br/>Somethin' about this town stinks real bad.")
('Van', "And not to toot our own horn, but we're just as good<br/>at sniffin' around as bracers, if not better.")
('Nina', 'Heehee! Well, you heard him, Judith. He<br/>sounds confident. What do you say?')
('Judith', "Gah! Fine, all right. I can't really keep griping when<br/>these people have clearly done their homework.")
('Judith', "I'm still not getting my hopes up too high, mind you.<br/>But I'll join Nina in making this a formal request<br/>from the two of us.")
('Judith', 'Show me you people are more than just talk and<br/>deliver us results. And I want the girls to stay safe out<br/>there, you hear me?')
('Judith', "I'm not just talking about avoiding fights.<br/>The Entertainment District here isn't exactly safe, or<br/>a good influence in general.")
('Judith', "You two guys, I don't care about. Go nuts if<br/>you want.")
('Aaron', 'Wow. I can really feel the love.')
('Feri', "Wait, hold on. What's so bad about this<br/>Entertainment District?")
('Agnès', "Ahaha, let's not worry about that, Feri. Anyway, we'll<br/>be careful, Judith, I promise.")
('Director Gotti', "Gahaha! I see you're all having a party<br/>in here!")
('Director Gotti', "Hey there, Judith! And glad to see you're<br/>doing great, Nina, baby!")
('Agnès', 'Huh?')
('Van', "Wait, isn't that—")
('Nina', 'Mr. Gotti?!')
('Judith', "What are you doing? You can't just barge in<br/>on people!")
('Director Gotti', "I heard you girls were in town! I couldn't not come<br/>over and say hello now, could I?")
('Director Gotti', "We're all friends here! There's no need to be<br/>all formal!")
('Director Gotti', 'Oho! And who might you two ladies be?')
('Director Gotti', "You both look a little young, but with a bit of polish,<br/>I'm sure you would shine bright!")
('Director Gotti', "Tell you what: why don't you take part in my<br/>Carnal Cavalcade? Get a taste for the limelight.")
('Agnès', 'P-P-P-P-Pardon me?!')
('Feri', "What's a 'cavalcade'...?")
('Aaron', "Well, this guy's a piece of work.")
('Director Gotti', "Ah, and you look like someone who'd take to the<br/>silver screen! We've already got plenty of guys in the<br/>parade as it is, but...")
('Director Gotti', '...it can never have enough feminine charm!<br/>What can I do to convince you to get out there and<br/>cross dress as a lady, huh?')
('Judith', "Now you've done it.")
('Aaron', "I'll have you know I can play a woman just fine.<br/>That said...I think I know who you are now.")
('Van', "There's no doubt. We're lookin' at Director Salvatore<br/>Gotti himself.")
('Feri', 'Whoa! You mean the guy who made Golden Blood?!')
('Agnès', "And he's involved with the film festival at every level,<br/>as I understand.")
('Director Gotti', "Darn tootin'! Can't say I'm shocked you kids<br/>recognize me! You are here for MY film festival,<br/>after all! Gahaha!")
('Van', "I had the pleasure of seein' Golden Blood, for what<br/>it's worth.")
('Van', "The cinematography when things hit a fever pitch<br/>still didn't get in the way of how clever it all was.<br/>It's an amazing sequence.")
('Van', 'Not to mention the way the protagonist makes the<br/>audience feel right at the climax...')
('Van', "Themes of freedom from oppression, and a<br/>celebration of life at the same time, both coming<br/>through without clashin'. It was great.")
('Judith', '...!')
('Director Gotti', "Well, I'll be damned.")
('Director Gotti', "Son, I don't know who you are, but I see a bright<br/>future for you, too!")
('Director Gotti', "You're right on the money! I wanted my main<br/>character, Zoe, to free the humanity AND the eros<br/>trapped inside audiences!")
('Judith', 'Enough already, you two! Sheesh!')
('Nina', "Mr. Gotti, I think that's enough for now.")
('Director Gotti', "If you're so discerning, then you'll have no trouble<br/>appreciating my Carnal Cavalcade!")
('Director Gotti', "I can't go into details, but what I can say is that it'll<br/>bring together lots of models, dancers, and actresses,<br/>including our Judith and Nina!")
('Director Gotti', "It's going to make for one killer opening act for the<br/>film festival, I tell you! Even if it'll also be garnished<br/>with some guys, too.")
('Agnès', "(So that's what he's putting on...)")
('Feri', '(Sounds pretty fun, if you ask me!)')
('Aaron', "(Yeaaah, it's going to be all kinds of fun, if you catch<br/>my drift.)")
('Van', "So basically, you're gonna build off your work in<br/>Golden Blood and break new ground again, right?")
('Director Gotti', "Wahaha! You've got it! You really get what I'm going<br/>for here!")
('Director Gotti', 'Tell me, boy! What do they call you?')
('Van', 'Van Arkride. Nobody special—just a gofer from<br/>the capital.')
('Van', 'Here, lemme give you my business card.')
('Nina', "Well, it's good to see they're so excited.")
('Judith', "Those two are ridiculous. Can't President Dillon keep<br/>a tighter leash on Salvatore?")
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', 'Believe me, life would be so much easier if I could.')
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', 'Anyway, who are these people?')
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', "I think one of them said he was a 'gofer'? Better than<br/>a news reporter, I suppose.")
('Judith', "Oh, don't mind them. They're here on personal<br/>business for us.")
('Nina', "Yes, they're just helping out with a bit of a<br/>private matter.")
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', "Hmph. All right, I'll leave you to it.")
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', 'More importantly, Judith, Nina... I know you two just<br/>got here, but could you come upstairs?')
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', "There's someone I'd like to introduce you to.")
('Nina', 'Who is it?')
('Judith', "Wait. You don't mean...?")
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', "Come on—I need you two in the lounge on the<br/>top floor. It'll be rude to keep them waiting.")
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', "We'll be taking our leave now. You, too, Gotti.")
('Director Gotti', "Hey, hold on, Gaspard! I'm not done talking to<br/>these kids!")
('Director Gotti', 'We still need to negotiate their appearance in the—')
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', "Don't. Make me. Repeat. Myself.")
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', 'Time is money here. We really must be going. Right.<br/>Now.')
('Director Gotti', "Hey, wait! You kids! I promise I'll be in touch!<br/>My people, your people! Do lunch! All ri—")
('Feri', '...Phew. That guy was like a tornado.')
('Van', "Some luck we have, runnin' into both Gotti and<br/>President Dillon of Vegas Films himself.")
('Agnès', 'Mr. Dillon sure seemed to have, ahaha, trouble<br/>keeping Mr. Gotti under control.')
('Aaron', "Gotti's proof that you can't work in show business<br/>unless you have...well, a few screws loose.")
('Nina', 'Though, to be fair, that is part of the reason his films<br/>are so powerful.')
('Nina', 'Err, but just to be clear, not everyone working in this<br/>industry is as out there as him! I swear!')
('Judith', 'Yeah, maybe about thirty percent have their heads<br/>on straight. Maybe.')
('Judith', "Anyway, it looks like business calls. We'd better be on<br/>our way, too.")
('Judith', "You're free to decide the best course of action while<br/>you're in town.")
('Judith', 'Just make sure to report to us directly both tonight<br/>and tomorrow night, all right?')
('Nina', "Other than that, we won't tell you what to do.")
('Nina', 'Make sure to have some fun at the film festival itself,<br/>too, if you can!')
('Van', "Oh, you bet. Wouldn't miss it for the world.")
('Van', "Wish us luck, ladies. We'll see what we can dig up.<br/>We won't come back empty-handed.")
('Judith', 'Sounds good to me. See you tonight.')
('Feri', 'Oh, I just remembered! ...Hey, Agnès!')
('Agnès', 'Oh, right! Say, you two. Before you go, could we ask<br/>for a little favor?')
('System', 'Earned')
('Feri', 'Heehee. You think Shaheena will like these?')
('Agnès', "Absolutely! We'll have to figure out a good time to<br/>give them to her.")
('Van', "It's 1PM now. At this point, there've gotta be even<br/>more people milling around.")
('Van', "Let's do another tour around the city, especially the<br/>Entertainment District. We might spot somethin' we<br/>didn't see before.")
('Aaron', "All right. If that's the price I pay to keep a couple<br/>actresses company.")
('Aaron', 'You must be pretty raring to go after having that<br/>fancy cake, huh?')
('Van', "That's part of it. But I also feel like I can start putting<br/>you guys to work in earnest. Somewhat, at least.")
('Van', 'This next phase ought to make for good<br/>real-world training.')
('Van', "I've taught you three how a spriggan operates—how<br/>they think. Now it's your turn to go out there and<br/>work like one.")
('Agnès', 'Right!')
('Feri', 'Roger!')
('Aaron', "Sounds good to me! Just don't get too full of yourself<br/>with that kind of talk, man.")
('Bermotti', "Well, look who it is! I had a feeling I'd run into you<br/>all sooner rather than later.")
('Dingo', 'I see you guys have had no problem getting settled in<br/>and working here.')
('Van', "Forget us. Last I checked, you weren't supposed to be<br/>here till tomorrow.")
('Agnès', 'I never thought I would see you hanging out with<br/>Bermotti, either.')
('Dingo', 'My schedule got bumped up, so I ended up running<br/>into this guy on the train.')
('Bermotti', 'And here I was going to try and surprise you all later!<br/>I even made Dingo keep it a secret, too.')
('Bermotti', "In my case, there's a bartending tournament taking<br/>place at the same time as the film festival, which I've<br/>been invited to.")
('Bermotti', 'To even have Van here with me...*sigh* it must<br/>be fate. What else could it be? ❤')
('Van', "Yeah, no. I've had run-ins with cops more fateful<br/>than this. Well, least it explains you two being an<br/>odd couple.")
('Van', "I assume this has nothing to do with you lining up<br/>4SPGs, and you're out here to cover the film festival?")
('Van', "Not the sort of beat I'd peg you workin'. A little...<br/>normal compared to your usual fare, ain't it?")
('Dingo', "It is what it is. There's something that caught my<br/>attention that I'm trying to look into.")
('Agnès', 'What do you mean? Does it have to do with the<br/>film festival?')
('Feri', "Is it related to Nina's request somehow?")
('Dingo', "No, it's something different. Though granted, I can't<br/>entirely rule out them being related, at the moment.")
('Aaron', 'Mmm, boy, that sure answers a lot.')
('Van', "Is this that scoop you're always pursuin' on<br/>the downlow?")
('Van', 'Never heard what the deal is there.')
('Dingo', 'Well...how should I put it...?')
('Harold', 'Forgive my interruption, Mr. Brad, Mr. Bermotti.')
('Bermotti', 'Now this is a surprise.')
('Dingo', 'What is it?')
('Harold', "I'm terribly sorry to bother you, sir. You have a call<br/>waiting for you.")
('Harold', 'A woman going by the last name Aymé contacted<br/>the front desk.')
('Dingo', 'Say what?!')
('Feri', "Aymé? Isn't that the reporter?")
('Agnès', 'Marielle?')
('Aaron', 'Oh, you mean that gullible reporter we saw back<br/>in Langport?')
('Bermotti', 'As I recall, she works for the Tyrell Times and has<br/>the hots for old Dingo, here. Bigtime hots.')
('Bermotti', 'Do you have a scorching date planned all the way<br/>out here? Sounds like things are really blossoming<br/>between the two of you.')
('Dingo', 'Like hell they are. I specifically told her to keep away<br/>from me for this trip.')
('Dingo', "Sorry, I'd better take care of this. I'll see you all later.")
('Van', 'Poor guy. Always being put through the wringer by<br/>that girl.')
('Bermotti', "Haha. He just can't seem to keep her hanging<br/>for long.")
('Bermotti', 'Anyway, that bartending tournament I was talking<br/>about is being hosted at the Al-Jumeirah Hotel.')
('Bermotti', "I'm going to hang out here a bit longer and then<br/>make my way over there.")
('Bermotti', "If I hear anything interesting, I'll be sure to get<br/>in touch. In the meantime, good luck, everyone!")
('Van', "Sounds good. Can't wait to hear what you dig up.")
('Feri', 'Thanks, Bermotti! Good luck with your tournament!')
('Aaron', 'You should treat us to some cocktails. You know,<br/>taste testing before the grueling competition.')
('Agnès', "Aaron, no! We're here to work!")
('Agnès', 'Right, where were Nina and Judith staying again?')
(40301, 'Hnngh! You must be Mr. Arkride and company.')
(40301, 'Ms. Lanster and Ms. Fenly are waiting for you all by<br/>the pool.')
(40301, "The clerk there already knows you're coming.<br/>You're free to enter whenever you're ready.")
('Van', 'Good to hear. Thanks.')
('Aaron', "That's one way to say hello. At least his customer<br/>service is impeccable.")
('Risette', "I'd expect nothing less from a six-star facility.")
('Feri', "I don't get it. Why would they be at the pool when<br/>it's night?")
('Aaron', "It's a nighttime pool. You get to drink alcohol and all<br/>that good stuff there.")
('Aaron', "But a little kid like you can't really appreciate<br/>grownup stuff like that yet.")
('Feri', "I am not! If you think I can't handle alcohol, I'll prove<br/>you—")
('Agnès', "Feri, NO. Not until you're older. And, Aaron? Don't.<br/>Go putting any ideas. In her head.")
('Aaron', 'G-Got it...')
('Risette', '(I see Agnès is rather mature for her age.)')
('Van', '(You could say that. She can definitely be forceful<br/>when she needs to be.)')
('System', 'The main story will advance upon entering the hotel<br/>swimming pool.')
('Feri', 'Whoa! So this is what a nighttime swimming pool<br/>looks like!')
('Agnès', "It's so calm and relaxed. The view of the oasis is<br/>nice, too.")
('Aaron', "I dunno about 'calm.' With all these folks drinking, I<br/>bet it can get pretty rowdy.")
('Van', "Nah, you've seen this place. 'Rowdy' guests get shown<br/>the door. Now, where're the girls...?")
('Bermotti', 'Well, we meet again!')
('Bermotti', "Beautiful night we're having, isn't it? Are you darlings<br/>done with work for the night, hmm?")
('Van', 'More or less, yeah.')
('Agnès', "I didn't realize you'd be working here, Bermotti.")
('Bermotti', 'Yeah! They called me in as an extra pair of hands to<br/>pitch in before the tournament.')
('Bermotti', "And I don't think we've met before. You are...?")
('Risette', "Risette Twinings. It's a pleasure to make your<br/>acquaintance, Mr. Bermotti.")
('Bermotti', 'Hold on! Are you the one contracted to work<br/>with Van? What are you—')
('Van', "It's a long story. More to the point, are our actresses<br/>anywhere around here?")
('Bermotti', "Ah, you must mean those two. They're right<br/>over there.")
('Aaron', "*whistle* NOW we're talking. Two A-listers walking<br/>around in swimsuits. You love to see it.")
('Nina', "Oh, there you are! Sorry we're a little underdressed<br/>right now.")
('Van', "I got half a mind to tell you two off for loungin'<br/>around in bikinis while we've been out there bustin'<br/>our butts.")
('Van', "Buuut comin' back to a sight like this makes it all<br/>worth it. I'll let it slide.")
('Judith', "We're not wearing these for you, you know. Yeesh!")
('Judith', "We've been working pretty hard ourselves. A certain<br/>president was parading us around, left and right<br/>all day. We're bushed!")
('Van', "Right, that bit earlier. Sorry—should've realized that.")
('Agnès', 'I can certainly imagine how that would get pretty<br/>draining, doing all that meeting and greeting.')
('Feri', 'Sounds like you earned your keep today.')
('Judith', "Right back at you, gir—hold on! Did you get<br/>ANOTHER girl? It's only been a few hours!")
('Risette', "You are Judith Lanster and Nina Fenly, if I'm not<br/>mistaken, yes?")
('Risette', "It's an honor to meet you both. My name is<br/>Risette Twinings. I'm assisting everyone temporarily.")
('Nina', "O-Okay...? Well, it's nice to meet you, too, Risette.")
('Judith', "...I really can't imagine what all you've gotten up to,<br/>but all right—let's hear what happened today.")
('Van', "Sure thing. Here's the gist of it...")
('Judith', 'You ran into someone dangerous in the waterway...<br/>AND found another threatening note?')
('Nina', 'Umm, Judith, maybe keep it down...?')
('Judith', "Ahem! Oh, that's wonderful, Nina! Sounds like it's<br/>gonna be pretty exciting! I can't wait!")
('Nina', 'Anyway, you guys have been through a lot today, it<br/>sounds like.')
('Nina', "This situation's getting pretty complicated at<br/>this point.")
('Judith', "And it sounds like it could be connected to the<br/>Messeldam film festival's cancellation?")
('Risette', "Yes, although that isn't confirmed at this stage.")
('Van', "Hard to see how all of these things tie together.<br/>But one thing's for sure: SOMETHING is clearly<br/>goin' down.")
('Van', "What's got me real concerned is that mysterious girl<br/>who showed up in the waterway.")
('Van', "Can't be sure yet that she's the one sendin' all those<br/>notes, but...")
('Agnès', "We definitely can't ignore her, even putting my own<br/>circumstances aside.")
('Feri', "Yeah, especially if A's involved in this.")
('Nina', '...?')
('Judith', "So basically, long story short, you still haven't figured<br/>anything out. Is that it?")
('Judith', 'So much for the spriggan living up to the hype, hmm?')
('Van', "You got us there. It's not what we were hoping<br/>for, either.")
('Nina', "Oh, be nice, Judith! They still did better than we<br/>could've expected for their first day here.")
('Nina', "If we hadn't hired them, we'd have gone into the film<br/>festival completely unprepared!")
('Judith', "...I get that. I'm not saying they did<br/>absolutely nothing.")
('Judith', "I'm just trying to make clear that we need to get this<br/>figured out sooner rather than later.")
('Judith', "I mean, this joker's sending notes to locals who were<br/>JUST scouted now! It pisses me off!")
('Aaron', "Getting a little worked up over this, aren't you?<br/>Not that I disagree, mind.")
('Feri', "Definitely. We can't let them win!")
('Agnès', '...')
('Agnès', "You know, there's something I can't help but wonder.<br/>What is the culprit trying to accomplish?")
('Judith', "What? What do you mean? What's there to wonder?")
('Van', "No, she's right. I don't see what this person's trying to<br/>get at, myself.")
('Van', "If all they wanted to do was cancel the film festival,<br/>it'd be quicker to just threaten a terror attack again<br/>and be done with it.")
('Van', "But instead, they're sendin' these notes to individual<br/>actresses and even dancers. That's a pretty<br/>roundabout way of doing it.")
('Nina', '...Huh.')
('Judith', "That's a good point...")
('Risette', "I see what you mean. The means and the ends don't<br/>appear to add up, so to speak.")
('Risette', "Even if it doesn't change the fact that the festival is<br/>still being interfered with.")
('Van', "Yeah. I got a feelin' that little contradiction is the key<br/>to all this.")
('Prince Sherid', 'Sounds like you all are having a rather<br/>intriguing conversation.')
('Aaron', "Huh? Hey, buddy. What the hell's your—")
('Judith', 'Y-Your Highness?!')
('Nina', "I didn't realize you were here, too. I'm sorry we aren't<br/>exactly dressed for a meeting with the prince.")
('Prince Sherid', "Oh, please—you've nothing to worry about.")
('Prince Sherid', "You two are like a pair of flowers, blooming in<br/>the desert. You're the film industry's<br/>greatest treasures! Zemuria's treasures!")
('Prince Sherid', 'Please, bless us with your beauty as you wish.<br/>Quench the thirsts of we cast down mortal men with<br/>your presence!')
('Nina', 'Ahaha...')
('Judith', "*sigh* You certainly have a...way with words, that's<br/>for sure.")
('Aaron', '(Color me intrigued.)')
('Agnès', '(Could he be...?)')
('Risette', '(...)')
('Naje', 'Your Highness, please, remain respectful.')
('Prince Sherid', "Haha, I'll tone it down, Naje, fear not.")
('Prince Sherid', 'Ah, but where are my manners? Allow me to<br/>introduce myself. I am Sherid Asval, son of Grand<br/>Prince Salman of Elsaim.')
('Prince Sherid', 'This is my dear and trusted secretary, Naje.')
('Prince Sherid', "Judith and Nina have informed me about you all.<br/>It appears you're handling their 'private' business<br/>for them?")
('Prince Sherid', "If so, I'd like to consult with you all about a certain<br/>something, as well, if it would not be an imposition.")
('Agnès', '...!')
('Van', "...All right. We're listenin'.")
('Van', "First off, let me reiterate that it's a real pleasure to<br/>make your acquaintance, Prince Sherid.")
('Van', "I wouldn't ever expect a guy as big and important as<br/>you to give some guy doin' odd jobs in Calvard like<br/>me the time of day.")
('Prince Sherid', "You're too humble, Mr. Arkride. I understand you're<br/>exceedingly capable, so I wanted to make sure to talk<br/>to you.")
('Prince Sherid', "As a matter of fact, I've heard things about all of<br/>you...including your 'temporary help.'")
('Risette', 'You honor me, Your Highness.')
('Feri', '...?')
('Aaron', "Still, can't say a swimming pool is where I expected to<br/>bump into the heir to a throne. Life's just full<br/>of surprises!")
('Agnès', 'I knew you were one of the sponsors for the<br/>film festival...')
('Agnès', "...but I can't believe someone of your stature would<br/>actually receive one of those threatening notes.")
('Nina', "Well, it's true, unfortunately. The contents are the<br/>same as the one we got.")
('Judith', "The prince got the letter five days ago. He's been<br/>staying at the grand suite. That's just about the same<br/>time as ours came in.")
('Judith', 'I guess that means they were sent to both Edith and<br/>Tharbad at the same time, then, huh?')
('Naje', "I initiated an investigation immediately, of course,<br/>but we still haven't determined how the note got to<br/>the prince.")
('Naje', 'At the very least, it appears to have been<br/>expertly camouflaged.')
('Feri', 'Sounds just like what happened with Saara when she<br/>got her note.')
('Prince Sherid', "You're referring to the dancer I recommended to<br/>Gotti, yes? I'd heard she'd received one as well.")
('Prince Sherid', 'Given she was only scouted this afternoon, however,<br/>that is...exceedingly swift. The timing is too perfect.')
('Prince Sherid', 'I believe at this stage that we can safely rule out this<br/>being some mere prank. Do you agree?')
('Van', "Yeah. I'm right there with you.")
('Van', 'In fact, I think it crossed that line as soon as you were<br/>sent your note, Your Highness.')
('Aaron', "Yeah. Whoever we're dealing with, this guy's either<br/>got guts or he's a complete dumbass. Maybe even a<br/>little bit of both.")
('Aaron', 'That being said, for a guy who received a threat, you<br/>seem pretty relaxed about it, Your Highness.')
('Aaron', 'Must feel pretty confident in your lady friend there to<br/>approach the likes of us, too.')
('Prince Sherid', 'Haha! You are not incorrect, my friend.')
('Prince Sherid', "Truth be told, she is also my bodyguard, and one of<br/>the principality's greatest swordfighters.<br/>Quite possibly its very best.")
('Prince Sherid', 'In fact, I would go so far as to reckon she outclasses<br/>even the likes of Mr. Arkride and your concierge.')
('Aaron', 'No kidding?')
('Risette', 'To be honest, I suspected as much since first laying<br/>eyes on her.')
('Naje', '...')
('Van', 'You got me there. Hard to stack up against a<br/>bodyguard serving such a hot shot.')
('Van', "Oh, and just to be clear, Van's fine. No need to be<br/>stiff with me.")
('Prince Sherid', 'Van it is, then. You are twenty-four, yes? That makes<br/>me three years older than you.')
('Prince Sherid', 'Everything Mr. Gotti has told me about you adds up.<br/>You clearly have a lot of promise.')
('Prince Sherid', 'After all, not just anyone could discern the deep,<br/>nuanced themes behind Golden Blood.')
('Prince Sherid', "...I suppose I am right in thinking you've seen the<br/>limited run R-17 director's cut?")
('Van', "Of course! No real fan could miss it! Wish I could<br/>catch it again while I'm here, too.")
('Van', "But with my underage assistants taggin' along, I can't.<br/>A shame. It makes for a real good watch.")
('Prince Sherid', "Ah, I knew you were a man of taste! I couldn't<br/>agree more!")
('Prince Sherid', "My younger sister once happened to see it as well,<br/>and I'll tell you, she was giving me the dirtiest looks<br/>for the longest time after that...")
('Van', "Sounds like it must've been a tryin' time in the<br/>Asval household.")
('Feri', 'Wow. These two are like peas in a pod.')
('Agnès', "You don't have to get so excited, Van. Please.")
('Risette', "I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that a man of His<br/>Highness' status would even know Mr. Arkride's age.")
('Aaron', "I like him. He's a guy who's clearly true to himself.<br/>You don't see high-and-mighty rich boys as<br/>unreserved as him every day.")
('Judith', "It must be so tiring working with a guy like him all<br/>the time, isn't it?")
('Naje', "No, I'm...used to it at this point.")
(40302, 'Hey, is that Judith Lanster? And Nina Fenly?!')
(40301, 'Wow! Real stars out and about in their swimsuits!<br/>Only at the Al-Jumeirah, I tell you!')
(40302, 'Hey, could you girls give us autographs? Or better yet,<br/>why not come and have some fun with us, huh?')
(40302, '...Wait.')
('Feri', 'We meet again.')
('Agnès', 'This is where you guys are staying? Of all the places...')
('Aaron', "This place must take anyone who can pay if they'll let<br/>trash like this stay here.")
(40302, "Give me a break! You're those pricks from<br/>this afternoon!")
(40301, 'What the hell are you doing here?!')
('Prince Sherid', 'Oh, more guests. Are these friends of yours?')
('Van', "Not quite. We had a little business with them<br/>earlier today. Sorry, Your Highness. I'll make<br/>everyone pipe down.")
(40302, "Like hell you will! Your luck's run out, buddy!<br/>You're in big trouble!")
(40301, "You guys take on the dudes. We'll—")
(40302, 'Huh...?')
(40301, 'Aaaaaaaaahh!')
('Aaron', 'Holy...')
('Feri', '(She moved so fast!)')
('Bermotti', 'Oh, my. Have more young men come to play? ❤')
('Bermotti', "I've got to hand it to you all. It takes guts picking a<br/>fight with the prince of Elsaim.")
('Bermotti', "Shouldn't you boys be enjoying this beautiful<br/>night elsewhere?")
('Bermotti', "Althooough if you insist on staying, I'll be more than<br/>happy to show you all a good time. ❤")
(40301, "O-Our mistake! We'll be leaving now!")
('Van', "No wonder you're His Highness' right hand.<br/>That's some quick swordplay you've got there.")
('Naje', 'It was nothing. I could have handled ones such as<br/>them in my sleep.')
('Prince Sherid', "As I said. One of the Principality's best.")
('Aaron', 'No doubt.')
('Feri', "(Wow. There's someone even better than Elaine and<br/>Sylphid...? Guess I have a lot to learn.)")
('Prince Sherid', "Well! With that excitement out of the way, I suppose<br/>now's as good a time as any to wrap up.")
('Prince Sherid', "I know it is not much, but I'm prepared to offer the<br/>same sum as these ladies in exchange for<br/>your services.")
('Prince Sherid', "But please, don't let my case trump theirs.<br/>Whenever you figure things out, just be sure to pass<br/>the information on to me.")
('Prince Sherid', 'It was a pleasure to meet you all. I expect great things<br/>from your impromptu helper as well.')
('Aaron', "Okay, seriously. What's the deal with that maid of<br/>yours, huh?")
('Aaron', 'That prince seemed extra keen on her for some<br/>reason, too.')
('Van', "...So it wasn't just me who noticed, huh?")
('Van', "But given her employment background, maybe it's<br/>not so weird that word about her gets around.")
('Aaron', 'For real?')
('Aaron', 'You sure are trusting of this woman you have a shady<br/>ass contract with, too, you know.')
('Aaron', "Today was your first time actually meeting her,<br/>wasn't it?")
('Van', "Yeah, but we've been in touch, back and forth, for<br/>about three years now. It's not like I don't know her<br/>at all.")
('Van', "But never mind that. Let's have our little peek and<br/>then head straight back. We don't want the girls<br/>worryin' about us.")
('Aaron', 'You sound like an old dad fretting over his daughter.')
('Van', "I'm not that old, damn it!")
('Van', 'Oh, yeah. Better make sure I go prepared.')
('Aaron', "Huh? What're you doing? Let's hurry up and go<br/>in already.")
('Aaron', '*whistle* Hell yeah! Now THIS is how you run<br/>a club!')
('Aaron', "Let's find some empty seats and get our asses in<br/>them, already.")
('Aaron', "I'll have a Tharbad Night. What about you?")
('Van', "I'll take an Alexander. Extra nutmeg.")
(40301, 'As you wish, sirs.')
('Aaron', "You're nothing if not consistent, aren't you?")
('Van', "What can I say? You gotta have it with nutmeg.<br/>It's pretty damn good, you know.")
('Van', '...?!')
('Van', '(What was that?)')
('Harwood', 'Heheh. The women here are exquisite.')
('Harwood', "Wouldn't you agree?")
('Van', 'Wait, what are—')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "Oh, come now, darling. Don't go lighting up in here.<br/>I'm sorry, dear. He's just had a little much to drink,<br/>is all.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "Still, there's something to be said for the<br/>occasional indulgence.")
('Harwood', "Just so. It's been some time since I last found myself<br/>in this city. It's shaping up to be a good stay.")
('Harwood', 'And I, for one, plan to make the most of it.')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "We should leave some parting gifts here as well for<br/>such a lovely time. It's only polite.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'The only question is what sort of presents young<br/>ladies like these days.')
(40301, "Now that's what I'm talking about!<br/>I couldn't take my eyes off that dancing!")
(40301, "And now, the woman you've all been waiting for...")
('Van', '...')
('Aaron', '...Hey.')
('Aaron', 'Hey! Pay attention!')
('Van', "What? What's the big—")
(40301, "Here she is, ladies and gentlemen! Tonight's star!")
(40301, "Tharbad's most beautiful nocturnal butterfly,<br/>handpicked to take part in the upcoming Carnal<br/>Cavalcade, it's...")
(40301, 'Lady...Saaraaaaaa!')
(40301, "You won't want to miss this! This could be her last<br/>performance here if her debut at the film festival<br/>makes a splash!")
(40301, "They say nobody's managed to take this vixen home.<br/>If anyone hopes to break that streak, tonight's your<br/>last shot!")
(40301, 'But enough from me! Cue the music!')
(500, 'October 6th, 12:30AM')
('Van', 'Ahh. So you got debts to pay.')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'Yeah...')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "My sister and I, we're not originally from Calvard.<br/>We grew up in a town in the Central East.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'When Shaheena was still little, my parents had a hard<br/>time making ends meet and borrowed money from<br/>some...unsavory characters.')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'Once my parents passed on, I tried to run away with<br/>Shaheena and we ended up here.')
('Aaron', "I'm guessing your peace and quiet didn't last long,<br/>and they were banging on your door soon enough?")
('Aaron', "Chasing you all the way out here... Those must've<br/>been some bad dudes your parents borrowed from.")
('Aaron', "The fact you've got this side hustle, too, and still<br/>haven't paid it off says a lot.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "I know. It's not something I'm exactly proud of...")
('Aaron', "Why? There's nothing to be ashamed of.")
('Aaron', "It's not like you've had to go and sell your body<br/>or anything. Hell, even if you did, you'd just be doing<br/>what you had to in order to survive.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', '...')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "To be completely honest... That's exactly how they<br/>wanted me to pay them back, at first.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "But I heard about Calvard and its system for<br/>absolving debts taken up by one's parents.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "When I thought about it, though, doing either one of<br/>those things would feel like I'd be renouncing<br/>their memories.")
('Van', "So you decided to repay them with the dancing you'd<br/>picked up in the family. I get it.")
('Van', "Way I see it, as long as those guys get their money<br/>back, they really can't complain how you make it.")
('Aaron', 'No wonder you were so hesitant on bringing in the<br/>guild earlier.')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "More or less. I appreciate what they do, but...I have<br/>to imagine they'd recommend I get the debt forgiven,<br/>and, well.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "It's stupid to be so proud over something like this,<br/>I know.")
('Van', "It's not exactly the most elegant way to go about<br/>things, to be sure.")
('Van', "...From the way you're talking, I'm guessin' you<br/>haven't said anything to your sister?")
('Van', 'Not just about your other job, but the debt itself.')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "It's...hard to tell her everything this far in, you know?")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "Plus there's actually some light at the end of the<br/>tunnel now.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'Once I get my commission for taking part in the<br/>Carnal Cavalcade, I should be able to pay the<br/>remainder off.')
('Aaron', "Aaah, so that's what you've got planned, huh?")
('Aaron', 'But man, I just do not get it. Why does everybody<br/>around me seem to always pick the path of<br/>most resistance?')
('Aaron', "Wouldn't it be smarter to take it easy as best you can<br/>and try to coast through life?")
('Van', 'Speak for yourself.')
('Van', "Once someone's set their mind on somethin', it's<br/>pretty damn hard to shake 'em off it.")
('Van', '...Anyway, I think things will be okay with Shaheena<br/>if you tell her.')
('Van', "Might get a little mad at you for keepin' it a secret,<br/>but she's mature enough to know you did it out of<br/>love for her.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', '...')
('Van', 'You just focus on the parade for the time being.<br/>Let the rest of us worry about that dumb old note.')
('Van', "I'd be lyin' if I said what I saw back there wasn't hot,<br/>but more than that, I could tell there was real art you<br/>put into it.")
('Van', "Oh, and don't worry about paying us any commission.<br/>That dance was all the reward fine young men like us<br/>could need.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'Aww, Van...')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "...All right. I won't worry about it. I'll make sure to<br/>knock them dead tomorrow. You won't want to<br/>miss it!")
('Aaron', '(Goddamn. This guy never misses a beat.)')
('Judith', "NOW. YOU'VE. DONE IIIT!")
('Van', '...!')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'Huh? Wh-What the—')
('Aaron', "Yo, what's your pro—hey! I know you! I've seen you<br/>in the tabloids!")
('Judith', 'I...am so disappointed in you, spriggan!')
('Judith', "You're dragging this poor woman around town all<br/>night, only to make her cry! Have you no shame?!")
('Judith', 'I always knew you were a good-for-nothing, and this<br/>proves it!')
('Van', "You were watchin' us this whole time? Don't you<br/>have anything better to do?")
('Van', "You know they call it beauty sleep for a reason, right?<br/>You'll age faster if you keep pulling all-nighters<br/>like this.")
('Judith', "EXCUSE me? Thanks for calling me old when<br/>I'm NOT!")
('Van', "I didn't say that! Quit puttin' words in my mouth!")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'Uhh, sorry to interrupt, but I think this is all a big<br/>misunder—')
('Judith', "Whatever. There's no reasoning with you.")
('Judith', "In the name of Aidios, I'll kick you straight to<br/>Gehenna, you unrepentant philanderer!")
('Aaron', "So you're the thief that's been causing all that<br/>mayhem in Edith, huh? Wait a sec...")
('Van', 'Save the chitchat for later! Here she comes!')
('Aaron', "Damn... She's pretty good!")
('Van', 'Just calm down, already! You got it all wrong!')
('Judith', 'Calm down? CALM DOWN?! I was such a fool,<br/>thinking you were anywhere near decent!')
('Judith', "Nina needs to wake up to the truth, and I'll do<br/>whatever—")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "Stop! You're making a mistake!")
('Judith', "What are you doing? Get out of the way! I'm here to<br/>give them their just—")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "You're wrong! Van and Aaron were just walking<br/>me home.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "I was just telling them about my life and got a little<br/>emotional in front of them, that's all.")
('Judith', "It's okay! You don't have to put on a brave<br/>face anymore! It must've been so hard dealing with—")
('Judith', '...What.')
('Judith', '...Seriously?')
('Judith', '...Huh.')
('Judith', "A-All right—I'll let you off the hook THIS time!")
('Judith', "But next time you make some poor girl cry, there'll be<br/>hell to pay, got it? You'd better remember that!")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'Wh-What was that all about?')
('Van', "Beats me. Looked like someone was playin' dressup<br/>as that infamous phantom thief and got a little TOO<br/>into her role.")
('Aaron', "(Hey, are you thinking what I'm thinking?)")
('Van', '(Yep. Sure looked like her.)')
('Van', "(Look, let it go. I'm sure she has her reasons for<br/>doing it. Diggin' into it will just cause us headaches.)")
('Aaron', '(Unreal...)')
('Dantès', '...')
('Melchior', "Well, what'd you think? Like what you saw?")
('Dantès', "That I did. They were just as I'd hoped.")
('Dantès', "Moreover, our surprise guests appear to be greatly<br/>anticipating what's to come.")
('Dantès', "I think it's time we turn up the heat. Don't you?<br/>Perhaps with a golden frenzy to instill some<br/>proper fear.")
('Melchior', 'Oh, I agree completely, boss. ❤')
(40301, 'You trying to mess with me? Huh?!')
(40302, 'What was that, asshole?!')
('Dingo', 'From the look of it, fights are breaking out across<br/>the city.')
('Dingo', 'The authorities are struggling to keep things<br/>under control.')
('Aaron', 'What the hell?')
('Risette', '...Mr. Arkride.')
('Van', "Right. Hey, Dingo. Let's meet at the parking lot.")
('Van', "We'll talk inside my truck. Sound good?")
('System', 'Later, once they felt better, arrangements were made<br/>to escort Shaheena and Marielle back to their home<br/>and hotel, respectively.')
('Shaheena', 'Saara...')
('Feri', "Oh, Shaheena! It'll be okay!")
('Nina', 'The last time I saw her was when we were on break,<br/>during our rehearsal.')
('Nina', 'She went to use the restroom and then...never<br/>came back.')
('Judith', 'I was getting pretty worried about how much time<br/>she was taking, so I checked with one of the guards.')
(40301, "If I'd seen anybody like that, I'm confident I<br/>would've noticed.")
(40301, "I checked every floor and couldn't find her anywhere.")
(40301, 'As far as I can tell, there are no signs she left through<br/>a side exit, either.')
('Fie', "I'm only asking this to make sure, but...")
('Fie', "...your sister wasn't complaining about being in the<br/>parade or anything, was she?")
('Shaheena', "No, absolutely not! There's no way she would bail out<br/>of it!")
('Nina', 'Yeah. She was absolutely fired up about it.')
('Judith', 'Definitely. I mean, hell, it was getting us amped<br/>up, too. Her mood was infectious.')
('Judith', 'Not to mention, she has such tremendous talent.<br/>Dancing might not be my thing, but even I could<br/>feel it.')
('Director Gotti', "That's because I have an eye for these things!<br/>They don't lie. That girl is a tremendous asset to<br/>the Cavalcade!")
('Aaron', "Not to mention, she's a professional. I just can't see<br/>her getting cold feet over something like this, all of<br/>a sudden.")
('Fie', "All right, if you guys are sure. Sorry for asking.<br/>I didn't mean to offend anyone.")
('Shaheena', "...I know. You're just doing what you need to.")
('Fie', "Anyway, seeing as we're talking about a civilian going<br/>missing, I'm going to have to get the guild involved.")
('Fie', 'Everybody okay with that?')
('Nina', 'Absolutely. We appreciate you helping us.')
('Director Gotti', "I'll pay any amount! Mira is no object!")
('Director Gotti', "Just do whatever you have to in order to find that girl!<br/>My parade isn't complete without her, understand?")
('Judith', 'What about you guys? What are you going to do?')
('Van', "Like you need to ask. She's a client we swore<br/>to protect. There's only one thing for us TO do.")
('Van', 'Although we might ask for a free dance later to make<br/>it worth our while. Sound good?')
('Shaheena', 'Van...thank you.')
('Van', "(We'll figure it out somehow. Don't do anything<br/>reckless while we're gone. Got it?)")
('Judith', "(I-I don't know what you're talking about! Mind your<br/>own business!)")
('Fie', "All right, I'm going to fill the others in at the<br/>guild branch. I'll also find out what's going on with<br/>the police.")
('Dingo', "I'll pretty much be doing the same thing, hitting up<br/>sources in various places. I'll be sure to let Bermotti<br/>know what's going on, too.")
('Van', "That'd be great. Thanks, you two.")
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', "What's with all of this racket? The festival is<br/>nearly here. What could've possibly happened to<br/>cause such chaos?")
('Director Gotti', "What? You haven't heard?!")
('Director Gotti', 'That girl I scouted out yesterday—Saara—<br/>she disappeared! Nobody knows where she went!')
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', '...Oh? Is that so?')
('Director Gotti', "We have to act! Get the company into gear and start<br/>throwing everything we've got!")
('Director Gotti', "I don't care if it takes every single employee!<br/>We've got to find Saara! Now!")
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', "Now, now. Don't you think you're being just a little<br/>rash, Gotti?")
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', "We're talking about a dancer. What's it to us if one or<br/>two of them run away?")
('Director Gotti', 'WHAT?!')
('Shaheena', "But my sister, she's—")
('Judith', 'Hold on. Dillon, where the hell is this attitude<br/>coming from? This is serious.')
('Nina', "By all appearances, it's very likely she didn't<br/>simply disappear.")
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', 'Please. Her up and poofing away does nothing to<br/>hamper our final preparations for the festival.')
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', "If one of you two went missing, it'd be<br/>another matter. But her? She's merely some extra one<br/>of us hired on a hunch. Nothing more.")
('Shaheena', '...!')
('Director Gotti', 'Are you out of your mind? How many times do I<br/>have to explain it to you?!')
('Director Gotti', "Saara is not 'some extra'! She's irreplaceable! She's the<br/>linchpin for all my plans! My parade isn't complete<br/>without—")
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', "Enough! I'm done listening to this.")
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', "As far as I'm concerned, as long as the Cavalcade<br/>proceeds in some fashion or another, that's all<br/>that matters.")
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', "If this woman turns up, wonderful. If not, you'll<br/>simply have to compromise on your grand<br/>vision, Gotti.")
('Director Gotti', 'Graaah!')
('Director Gotti', "What IS that fool's problem?!")
('Feri', 'That was so, so cold. How could he...?')
('Aaron', "Seems pretty clear to me that the walls're closing in<br/>on him.")
('Risette', 'Indeed. That does seem like more than it simply<br/>being the day before the festival and deciding a<br/>change of tack is impractical.')
('Agnès', 'I think so, too.')
('Van', 'We got the circumstantial evidence—now we just<br/>gotta figure out what move to make.')
('Nina', '(...?)')
('Judith', '(...)')
('Shaheena', "Mr. Gotti, I'm sure Saara will come back! I just<br/>know it!")
('Shaheena', "She always pulls through. She could come down with<br/>a cold before a big show and she'd still shake it off<br/>and dance her best ever!")
('Shaheena', 'She just...might run a little late and need more time<br/>than usual.')
('Shaheena', 'But until then, let me help! Bring me on as a good<br/>luck charm for getting her back!')
('Feri', "I hope Shaheena's gonna be okay...")
('Nina', "Don't worry. She will be. She's got Judith with her.")
('Nina', "Though I'm surprised. I've never seen anyone manage<br/>to be so persuasive with Mr. Gotti before, heehee.")
('Risette', 'Despite only being fifteen years old, she is already a<br/>true professional. I certainly find myself impressed.')
('Agnès', "I'm sure she gets a lot of her strength from her sister.<br/>Saara seems like a wonderful role model.")
('Van', 'Yeah. She really does.')
('Director Gotti', "Oh, my dear, sweet girl. That's such a generous offer.")
('Director Gotti', "But there's no way you could possibly replace your<br/>sister in my parade.")
('Shaheena', "But I grew up watching her dance! There's nobody<br/>that understands what she does better than me!")
('Shaheena', 'Nobody else is going to be as good as—')
('Director Gotti', 'You and your sister are two very different ladies.<br/>Her dancing and sex appeal are completely her own.')
('Director Gotti', "It's not enough to just be related and dance the<br/>same dance. You still won't have the same effect on<br/>the people watching.")
('Director Gotti', "Frankly, my dear, you just aren't a good fit for the sort<br/>of parade I've got in mind.")
('Shaheena', '...')
('Shaheena', "I can't... I can't take this anymore. I hate seeing Saara<br/>being the only one working so hard, day after day!")
('Shaheena', "She always brushes it off like it's nothing, trying to<br/>make sure I don't see how much it all hurts her!")
('Shaheena', "Sometimes she even goes out pretending like she's off<br/>to see her 'boyfriend.'")
('Shaheena', "I WISH she had someone like that! I wish that was<br/>what's going on, but she can't fool me!")
('Feri', '(Poor Shaheena...)')
('Agnès', '(So she knew all along...)')
('Van', '...')
('Shaheena', "Maybe I can't match up to her now, but that doesn't<br/>mean I can't train hard! I can make any outfit you put<br/>on me work, too!")
('Shaheena', "If I can't just totally replace my sister, then we can<br/>find something that'll fit me!")
('Shaheena', "I won't just live up to your vision! Give me a chance<br/>and I'll blow it out of the water with something<br/>even better!")
('Director Gotti', '...!')
('Judith', 'Wow...')
('Aaron', 'Damn.')
('Director Gotti', "All right, young lady. You're on!")
('Director Gotti', "But if you're going to talk that big, you'd better walk<br/>that big as well! Failure is NOT an option!")
('Director Gotti', "And hey, if your sister comes back, we'll get you both<br/>in the parade and make you two a duo for the ages!")
('Shaheena', "Mr. Gotti, you're the best!")
('Nina', 'Mr. Gotti...thank you.')
('Director Gotti', "Hardly! You know me. When I set my mind on<br/>something, I don't let anything get in my way!<br/>That's just the kind of man I am.")
('Director Gotti', 'Festival is tomorrow! I expect you to train your<br/>buns off till the very last minute! Got it?')
('Shaheena', "Yes, sir! I wouldn't have it any other way!")
('Judith', "From what I've seen, your technique is solid enough.<br/>You already know how to mimic your sister's moves.")
('Judith', 'That means we need to focus on polishing your steps<br/>and making sure YOUR charm comes through.')
('Judith', "C'mon. I'll show you how a world-class actress knocks<br/>her audience off their feet.")
('Judith', "It's probably going to take us all night, but that's what<br/>it'll take to get you on your sister's level. Are<br/>you ready?")
('Shaheena', "Ready as I'll ever be!")
('Judith', "As for you, Nina, you're in charge of keeping in touch<br/>with these doofuses and the guild. Stay on top of<br/>everything, okay?")
('Nina', 'Yeah, I can handle that.')
('Director Gotti', "Nice! Sounds to me like we're aaall set! Let's roll<br/>those cameras, people!")
('Risette', "She's clearly earned her reputation as a<br/>best-in-class actress.")
('Van', "Yeah. Seems like she's got a good bead on<br/>Shaheena's skills. She'll get her ready.")
('Aaron', "Heh, hard to believe she's such a bumbling mess off<br/>the job.")
('Feri', 'Heehee! Right? I respect her a bit more now.')
('Agnès', '...?')
('Nina', 'What are you talking about...?')
('Van', "Inside joke between us. Don't worry about it.<br/>Anyway...")
('Van', "Now that you've heard the gist of things, has this<br/>rung any bells you might've overlooked before?")
('Van', "Maybe any doubts or suspicions you've had about<br/>Vegas Films?")
('Nina', "You're talking about the rumors of its relationships<br/>with the underworld and...drug trafficking, right?")
('Nina', "I really don't want to believe that such a big company,<br/>in my own line of work, could be involved in<br/>such things...")
('Nina', "...but it's true that Vegas has been expanding in a way<br/>that can't be explained just by Mr. Gotti's<br/>involvement.")
('Nina', "And yes, I've heard bits and pieces. People around the<br/>industry have a lot to say about Vegas.")
('Nina', "So when that threatening note came in, it did feel like<br/>something bigger was going on. I'm not sure what,<br/>but...it's there.")
('Agnès', "Wow. I didn't realize there was so much intrigue<br/>going on before we even arrived.")
('Aaron', "If the company's the culprit behind this, there's no<br/>way that snooty president is clueless about it all.")
('Aaron', "And if that's true...the man's up to his nose in<br/>drug running. At least on some level.")
('Aaron', "Who knows what's up with the notes, but after all<br/>that, he's GOT to have something to do with Saara<br/>going missing, right?")
('Feri', 'I guess, but could a guy like him really...?')
('Nina', '...')
('Agnès', 'Nina? Are you okay?')
('Nina', "Sorry, I'm okay...ish. This is all just...rattling me a bit<br/>more than normal.")
('Nina', "Like Feri said, it's hard for me to picture Mr. Dillon<br/>doing such things!")
('Nina', "I mean, we're talking about the same man who's<br/>always getting pushed around by Mr. Gotti, including<br/>allowing the parade at all.")
('Risette', 'Even if he were a man with more backbone, the risks<br/>involved with illicit drug smuggling are considerable.')
('Risette', "Which means you believe Mr. Dillon doesn't—or<br/>shouldn't—have the courage to arrange something so<br/>flagrantly illegal?")
('Nina', "Yes. I'm not trying to dismiss everything you're saying<br/>or have seen, but...it's just so hard to reconcile.")
('Agnès', 'Hmm... Be that as it may, the circumstances paint<br/>him as our most likely culprit.')
('Agnès', "Even if he's normally not 'brave,' what if, for some<br/>reason, he had no choice but to play along with such<br/>a scheme?")
('Aaron', "Ahh, I see what you're getting at.")
('Risette', "That's an excellent point. It would be perfectly<br/>plausible for criminal elements to do something<br/>underhanded to make him comply.")
('Nina', "So, wait, let me get this straight. We don't know how<br/>involved he is in whatever's going on.")
('Nina', "But you're saying that he could've been threatened<br/>into somehow helping this drug trafficking you're<br/>talking about?")
('Feri', 'Yeah, maybe...')
('Van', "That's sure how it looks.")
('Van', "It's all but certain that Dillon used Almata's help to<br/>grow Vegas Films into the juggernaut it is today, as<br/>fast as he did.")
('Van', "The money funneled to the political and financial<br/>sectors, the murky fundraising, Messeldam's festival<br/>going kaput, which was perfect for him...")
('Van', "Even if it seems like everything's goin' his way, all<br/>he's been doing is squeezin' further under his<br/>'benefactor's' thumb.")
('Van', "And being under Almata's thumb is a sure way to<br/>get crushed.")
('Agnès', "I...hadn't thought of it like that.")
('Aaron', 'Well, this is getting all amazingly grim.')
('Aaron', "In that case, good ol' Dillon probably isn't gonna stop<br/>at drug trafficking. I bet he's being put up to do<br/>something even worse, right?")
('Aaron', 'Like, say, something that could go down during the<br/>film festival here.')
('Nina', '...!')
('Nina', "Then the notes we've been receiving are—")
('Risette', 'Indeed. Almata is taking advantage of the film<br/>festival to plan something in this part of the country.')
('Risette', 'Caught in the middle of it, it would seem Mr. Dillon<br/>wants to take action before something<br/>hideous happens.')
('Risette', 'But he wishes to do it without quashing the festival.<br/>Simply doing that could bring the underlying conflict<br/>to the surface.')
('Feri', "Then does that mean that snooty guy's behind<br/>the notes?!")
('Agnès', 'Yes. The more I think about it, the more everything<br/>clicks into place. It all adds up.')
('Agnès', "Though, wait! Couldn't that also implicate him in<br/>Saara disappearing when she did?")
('Van', "It sure could, which would indicate Almata didn't<br/>snatch her—and she sure didn't vanish of her own<br/>free will.")
('Van', 'Gaspard Dillon abducted her and took<br/>her somewhere.')
('Bermotti', "Van, darling! I've got big news for you!")
('Van', 'Nice! You figured it out?')
('Kincaid', 'Looks like you owe me again, Van.')
('Elaine', "Oh, come on, René. We're all in this together.")
('Agnès', 'Elaine! And is that...?')
('Aaron', 'Oh, yeah. I remember you talking to someone<br/>yesterday all suspicious-like. That explains a<br/>few things.')
('Van', 'Ehh, never hurts to have a little insurance.')
('Van', "When I saw those idiots goin' nuts yesterday, I<br/>figured the possibility we'd run into trouble was there.")
('Elaine', 'Clearly your instincts are as sharp as ever.')
('Elaine', "If I'd known illicit drugs would be involved, I<br/>would've traveled to Tharbad, too.")
('Fie', "No, we're fine. What you're doing right now is<br/>extremely important. We can handle the<br/>situation here.")
('Kincaid', "That analyzer is the latest model from the Basel<br/>Institute of Science. It'll be perfectly accurate,<br/>don't worry.")
('Kincaid', "As for the form the drugs have taken and how they're<br/>being distributed, we're looking into that on our end.")
('Kincaid', "But I'm sure you already have some ideas about<br/>all that.")
('Nina', 'Wait, you do?')
('Feri', 'Er, really?')
('Van', 'I might. And I bet our diligent little concierge does<br/>as well.')
('Risette', 'Heehee! Nothing gets past you, does it, Mr. Arkride?')
('Aaron', "Well, aren't you two such geniuses? But yeah,<br/>something did feel off to me.")
('Aaron', 'I take it none of those dumbasses have mentioned<br/>anything about buying drugs so far?')
('Fie', 'No, not at all.')
('Feri', "They said they didn't even remember taking anything<br/>like that, right?")
('Agnès', "Is it possible they could've been forced to...ingest<br/>it, somehow?")
('Agnès', "It would need to have been right before the film<br/>festival and distributed in a way that wouldn't catch<br/>the police or guild's attention. Hmm...")
('Agnès', "(If there's any way to pull that off, it would've been...)")
('Agnès', "(No, that can't be it. I need to think harder.)")
('Agnès', "(It had to have been something we're missing. A way<br/>to conceal the drugs...)")
('Agnès', 'Wait. What about those new orbal hookahs that seem<br/>so popular recently?')
('Agnès', 'Come to think of it...the men who kidnapped<br/>Shaheena and Marielle had them!')
('Agnès', 'What if the drugs were mixed into the vapor<br/>ingredients of the hookahs?')
('Fie', 'Wha...?!')
('Bermotti', 'Oh, interesting hypothesis.')
('Van', 'Not just interesting. I think you got it in one.')
('Van', 'Think we can get the CID and guild to step in?')
('Van', "The festival's in enough trouble as it is. Anything to<br/>help it kick off more smoothly is worth it at this<br/>point, I think.")
('System', 'Earned')
('System', "With the CID's help, sales of the hookahs<br/>throughout the city were put to a halt in short order.")
('System', 'From there, Van and the others returned to the inn to<br/>take a brief break before getting back to business.')
('System', 'After getting in touch with some of their<br/>collaborators, the group took off for Vegas Films<br/>once more.')
(500, 'October 6th, 8:21PM')
('Aaron', 'Guess there was kind of a commotion over at<br/>the bazaar. Granted, that was the point, but still.')
('Agnès', "I'm just relieved that the hookahs could all be<br/>confiscated before any more damage could be done.")
('Van', "At this stage, we've laid down the groundwork and<br/>gathered the evidence.")
('Van', "For now, the guild and cops are simply going to be<br/>monitoring things. If we're going to act, now's<br/>our chance.")
('Risette', 'Indeed. There is no time like the present. Let us<br/>proceed to Vegas Films.')
('Feri', "We should probably check in with Shaheena and see<br/>how she's doing while we're at it.")
('Van', "(All right. We've prepared as much as we can<br/>for this.)")
('Van', '(Only thing left to do is close in on our suspect<br/>and pounce. Are we ready?)')
('System', 'Once you enter Vegas Films, day two will end and<br/>the main story will advance. Proceed?')
('System', 'Van and company entered the lobby, where they<br/>found Nina waiting for them.')
('System', 'After making some arrangements, they headed to the<br/>studio where Shaheena and Judith were training.')
(500, 'October 6th, 9:02PM')
('Shaheena', 'Hah!')
('Shaheena', 'Yah!')
('Shaheena', '*huff* *huff* Well, what do you guys think? You<br/>like it?')
('Feri', "That was awesome! I don't even know how to<br/>explain it! That was crazy-cool!")
('Agnès', 'Yeah, it had your usual carefree energy, but<br/>something about it felt a bit more refined, too. I<br/>liked it!')
('Aaron', "Yeah, you're putting your own spin on it that's<br/>different from your sister. Good on ya!")
('Van', "What's the verdict? Think she'll be ready in time?")
('Judith', 'Heh! Oh, ye of little faith! She will be. We still have<br/>plenty of time to finetune things to fit her in with<br/>the parade.')
('Director Gotti', "We need all the time we can get. She's good, but she's<br/>still not quite a match for Saara.")
('Director Gotti', "But give me the rest of the night and I'll whip her<br/>into shape, or my name isn't Salvatore Gotti!")
('Shaheena', "I'm counting on you, Mr. Gotti! With your help, I<br/>can do this!")
('Shaheena', "I just hope my sister—never mind. I trust you guys.<br/>I know you'll do great!")
('Shaheena', "Anyway, Mr. Gotti, I'm ready to learn the next part!")
('Director Gotti', "Fabulous! Then let's get back to work! So, when<br/>things loop back around...")
('Judith', "...Things sure have taken an interesting turn around<br/>here, haven't they?")
('Judith', 'Especially when it comes to those orbal hookahs and<br/>how they managed to get so popular.')
('Van', "Definitely. Luckily, we were able to put the screws to<br/>the distributor and get evidence out of 'em, too.")
('Van', "Apparently they'd been blasting out sample units all<br/>over town under the pretext of it being a campaign<br/>commemoratin' the festival.")
('Risette', 'Additionally, there are signs that they made it into<br/>the city without being inspected by the proper<br/>authorities beforehand.')
('Agnès', "Unfortunately, it seems like nobody has managed to<br/>uncover any direct evidence of Mr. Dillon's<br/>involvement yet.")
('Judith', "Yeah, but he's otherwise got 'guilty' written all<br/>over him. The nerve of that pompous ass, thinking he<br/>could get away with this!")
('Van', "Keep in mind, the big chief acted on his own.<br/>I'd guess Gotti's completely in the dark<br/>about everything.")
('Van', 'For now, just keep Shaheena and Gotti focused on<br/>the task at hand.')
('Van', "It's our job to worry about Saara. We're gonna do<br/>everything we can to bring her back.")
('Judith', '...Yeah, I know. All we can do is trust you.')
('Judith', "You think she's really somewhere in this building?")
('Aaron', "Based on what the cops and guild have figured out,<br/>there's no evidence that she ever left.")
('Aaron', 'It pretty much rules out any other place she could be.')
('Risette', "We've also uncovered more information thanks to<br/>Mr. Brad and the CID.")
('Risette', "According to them, there are discrepancies between<br/>the construction declaration filed a year ago and the<br/>construction firm's own paperwork.")
('Risette', "Said discrepancies appear to indicate that this<br/>building contains an entire additional floor that isn't<br/>officially accounted for.")
('Judith', '...!')
('Agnès', 'We suspect it contains some sort of security that only<br/>Dillon can get past, as the company president.')
('Agnès', "If Saara's anywhere in here, she's probably on that floor.")
('Feri', "But if we can create the right kind of diversion, he'll<br/>show us what he's really all about!")
('Feri', "In fact, Nina's helping to pinpoint which terminal he<br/>uses to get into that place, right now!")
('Judith', '...')
('Director Gotti', 'Judith, come over here!')
('Shaheena', 'I need your help deciding something—which of these<br/>dance patterns looks better?!')
('Judith', 'All right, just a sec!')
('Judith', "...You're looking for terminal A2. You're going to<br/>attempt anything, that's the one you want.")
('Van', '...!')
('Agnès', 'Did...she just...?')
('Aaron', "Sounds like somebody was going to act on her own if<br/>we didn't.")
('Nina', 'You guys!')
('Nina', 'Sorry to bother you. I managed to find a handful of<br/>terminals that can be accessed.')
('Nina', "The only problem is, they're not the right security<br/>level, so I'm not sure which would be the easiest to<br/>use to break int—")
('Van', 'No worries. We already got it figured out.')
('Risette', 'Yes. Could you please take us to terminal A2?')
(500, 'October 6th, 10:00PM')
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', "Damn it! I didn't expect the authorities to crack down<br/>on the orbal hookahs!")
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', "This is the end, isn't it...? No, no, no! Not yet!<br/>They can't have found any evidence that points to<br/>me yet!")
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', "In which case, maybe I should pull some strings with<br/>the police to keep those people away... No, that<br/>won't work!")
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', 'Damn it, damn iiit! Where did I go wrong?!<br/>I... How did I end up like this?!')
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', 'No, no! Enough moping! I just need to focus on<br/>getting through the film festival.')
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', 'Once I manage that, I can call in a favor with the<br/>ruling party and—')
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', "What is it? Don't you know how late it is?!")
('Aaron', "E-Excuse me, sir! I'm with security! You have a<br/>visitor waiting for you.")
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', 'A visitor? Who could possibly want to see me at<br/>this hour?!')
('Aaron', 'Well, you see...')
('Aaron', "They say they're with the Calvardian federal police.<br/>They want to speak with you directly.")
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', 'What?!')
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', "I-Impossible! They're already on to me?!")
('Aaron', "What's wrong, sir? Should I let them through?")
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', "No, do NOT! E-Especially if they don't have<br/>a warrant!")
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', "J-J-Just...buy me some time! I don't care what<br/>you do!")
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', 'DamnitdamnitDAMNIT! They leave me no choice...!')
(500, 'October 6th, 11:50PM')
('Inspector Daswani', '...So we meet again.')
('Van', "You're not the only one excited to cross paths again<br/>so soon after that hookah business.")
('Agnès', "Hello, detectives. It's good to see you.")
('Detective Nate', 'Augh... Can you believe it, Agnès? I was supposed to<br/>finally get a nice, quiet night off, until this guy here—')
('Inspector Daswani', 'Stow that moaning!')
('Inspector Daswani', 'The drug situation and the gravity of it was one<br/>matter, but this is entirely different.')
('Inspector Daswani', "You can't go trespassing and conducting searches<br/>without a warrant. What's the big idea? And why is a<br/>bracer involved?")
('Fie', "'A bracer' is involved because regulations dictate that<br/>rescuing a citizen in distress takes priority over<br/>other concerns.")
('Fie', "I have permission from our headquarters. I haven't<br/>broken any international treaties...technically.")
('Fie', "And these people aren't vigilantes. Think of them<br/>as...assistants, who have been retained to help the<br/>guild with its mission.")
('Inspector Daswani', 'Hmph.')
('Agnès', '(Wow. She came prepared to talk to the police<br/>and everything.)')
('Aaron', "(Smoooooth, throwing the law right back at them<br/>like that. I'm impressed.)")
('Feri', "(Same! Not that I'd expect anything less at<br/>this point.)")
('Inspector Daswani', "You must be the guild's 'hot new ace.' You're a real<br/>pain in my neck, you know that?")
('Inspector Daswani', "Our business isn't over. I expect you to come with me<br/>to check the crime site later.")
('Inspector Daswani', "And as for you, Arkride, you'd better be prepared for<br/>another interview in your future! Understand?")
('Van', "Yeah, yeah, loud and clear. I'll keep my<br/>schedule open.")
('Fie', 'Talk to you later, Inspector.')
('Shaheena', 'SAARAAAAAAA!')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'Shaheena...')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "I'm so sorry. You must've been worried sick...")
('Shaheena', "*sniffle* It's n-not your fault, you dummy! But...<br/>But...!")
('Shaheena', "But you don't have to do everything by yourself!<br/>I'm gonna help out, too, from now on!")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "...Thank you, Shaheena. I heard how hard you've<br/>been working for me.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "You've really grown up, haven't you?")
('Shaheena', '...*sob* Saaraaa!')
('Judith', "D'aww.")
('Nina', "It's so good to see them together again.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "*sniffle* You're telling me!")
('Bermotti', "Nice work back there, darlings. That can't have<br/>been easy.")
('Dingo', "This job ain't over yet, though.")
('Van', 'Unfortunately.')
('Director Gotti', "I...can't believe Gaspard was running around<br/>with gangsters...")
('Director Gotti', "And then to get—get killed off like that, after being<br/>led around and used by them...it's insane!")
('Risette', "We're lucky the file with the evidence was left intact.<br/>That's our one silver lining in all of this.")
('Agnès', "I just can't stop thinking about that message that was<br/>left at the murder scene...")
('Aaron', "Our 'friend' from Langport strikes again. Son of a<br/>bitch, making a big scene out of something that awful.")
('Feri', "He can't get away with this.")
('Van', "I'm just as worried about him as the rest of you, but<br/>there's still somethin' else we've got to figure out.")
('Van', "Saara might be back safe and sound with her sister,<br/>and the threatening notes won't be a concern<br/>any longer.")
('Van', "But now the question is, what the hell's gonna<br/>happen with the film festival?")
('Nina', 'That...is a good question.')
('Judith', "Yeah. We're talking about a murder case tied to<br/>drugs—one where the culprit with ties to organized<br/>crime is still at large.")
('Judith', "As much as I hate to admit it...honestly, I don't know<br/>if I see a way forward.")
('Director Gotti', 'Hmm...')
('Feri', 'No way! We just rescued Saara! She deserves a happy,<br/>dance-y ending!')
('Aaron', "Sure, but I can only imagine how exhausted she is<br/>after all that. Sure as hell doubt she's got it in her to<br/>dance at the parade.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', '...')
('Agnès', "Then does that mean the event here will end up just<br/>like Messeldam's festival?")
('Dingo', 'Well, about that...')
('Prince Sherid', 'It certainly shall not. Not on my watch.')
('Director Gotti', "Your Highness! I didn't realize you were here!")
('Van', 'What do you mean?')
('Prince Sherid', 'I mean exactly what I said. Everything will go on<br/>tomorrow as planned.')
('Prince Sherid', 'That goes for both the film festival itself as well as the<br/>Carnal Cavalcade.')
('Aaron', 'For real?')
('Agnès', "Are you sure it's a good idea to keep going?")
('Prince Sherid', 'Yes. I met with the other sponsors earlier to discuss it.')
('Prince Sherid', "In light of the circumstances, and the money spent<br/>promoting the festival, we all agree we'd rather avoid<br/>a last-minute delay or cancellation.")
('Prince Sherid', "As for President Dillon's death and criminal case, we<br/>already have measures in place to delay those<br/>public announcements.")
('Dingo', "What he said. With His Highness' help, I've<br/>contacted every news organization to<br/>coordinate things.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Wh-When the heck did you do that?!')
('Van', "Heh. So you're tellin' me business interests prevailed<br/>on this one.")
('Prince Sherid', 'Well, if you wish to be blunt about it, yes.')
('Prince Sherid', "I'm resigned to being at the mercy of such<br/>politicking these days thanks to my position, as much<br/>as it pains me to admit.")
('Fie', "Sure, but I imagine it's not all business. There's a<br/>certain someone the prince adores who's worked hard<br/>the last two years, too.")
('Prince Sherid', "Indeed. And just like him, if I'm going to put on this<br/>festival, I want to do it right and make it one<br/>worth remembering.")
('Prince Sherid', 'Certainly the rest of you agree, yes?')
('Nina', "...Yes. That's why we hired Van and his assistants to<br/>help us in the first place.")
('Judith', "Right. We've been preparing for this thing for all<br/>these months, and now it's almost here. We've got to<br/>see it through.")
('Director Gotti', "Precisely! I can't shelve my precious parade now!<br/>Not when it's so close to coming together!")
('Bermotti', "Hmm... I can't imagine the police or guild will be<br/>very happy to hear this news.")
('Fie', "Yeah. I'm honestly still really skeptical about moving<br/>forward with this.")
('Fie', "Especially not while Dillon's killer is still on the loose<br/>and while we're clueless about where that<br/>puppetmaster of ours is lurking.")
('Fie', "But...perhaps if we could task someone with keeping<br/>a close eye on what's happening on the shady side, I<br/>could be convinced to recommend otherwise.")
('Van', "Now I get it. So that's why His Highness is here.")
('Prince Sherid', 'That it is. I have an additional task for you all.')
('Prince Sherid', "It's simple: I'd like you to continue to keep watch over<br/>Tharbad until the end of the festival.")
('Agnès', 'Oh, umm, well...')
('Naje', 'Of course, we intend to be fully prepared for anything<br/>as well.')
('Naje', "However, since you've all proven yourselves with this<br/>Vegas Films business, I think you're more than up to<br/>the task of pitching in.")
('Aaron', 'Heh. Sure took you long enough to take a liking<br/>to us.')
('Risette', "I'm certain it can be attributed to all the hard work<br/>you and the rest of the company have put in these<br/>past two days.")
('Prince Sherid', "I'll compensate you well for your effort, have no fear.<br/>Consider it an apology for our transgression<br/>this afternoon.")
('Prince Sherid', "I won't ask you to go to too much trouble. You can<br/>still focus on enjoying the festival and parade, if<br/>you please. What do you say?")
('Shaheena', 'Do it for me, too, you guys! Please!')
('Shaheena', "I'm confident my sister will feel all better<br/>by tomorrow.")
('Shaheena', "Even if she doesn't, I'll be ready to take her<br/>place anytime!")
('Shaheena', "I want to put my training to use! I want to show<br/>everyone the dance we came up with that's as neat<br/>as Saara's!")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'Shaheena...')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "Well, I know this might be really selfish of me to ask<br/>after everything you've done to help us both, but...")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'I want you all there for us, too. Please, Van, Agnès,<br/>everyone...can you do it?')
('Van', "Well, damn. I was hopin' to do a little sightseeing<br/>before we made our way home, too.")
('Van', "But at this point, in for a curim, in for a torim.<br/>If you're gonna sweeten the deal that much, far be it<br/>from me to say no.")
('Agnès', "We've come this far to make sure everything goes<br/>without a hitch. We may as well see it through to<br/>the end.")
('Feri', "It's not like we have to do much different, either.")
('Aaron', "Buncha overachievers. I guess I'll play along if the rest<br/>of you care that much.")
('Director Gotti', "Then we've got a deal! We'll make this thing as glitzy<br/>as can be so we can send old Gaspard off in style!")
('Director Gotti', 'Hey, I know! What if we have ALL of the<br/>performers decked out as street dancers like Saara<br/>and Shaheena? That could pack a real punch!')
('Nina', 'Oooh! You know, that just might work!')
('Judith', "Nina, don't! You sure have a way of following him off<br/>the deep end sometimes.")
('Van', "Anyway, will 'that' be ready in time?")
('Risette', "Of course. I'll see to it that it is. We can never be<br/>too prepared.")

('Prince Sherid', 'I would, of course, be remiss not to acknowledge the<br/>cancellation of the Messeldam Film Festival two<br/>months ago. A most tragic event.')
('Prince Sherid', 'Its loss, however, shall not diminish our shared love<br/>for this burgeoning medium, even if our passion for it<br/>takes various shapes.')

('Agnès', 'Nothing unusual to report. Although...')
('Feri', 'Whoa! Shaheena and all the others look awesome!')
('Risette', 'Nothing to report at points E or F, either. This is<br/>quite the impressive procession, however.')
('Aaron', "It's straddling the line between wholesome and frisky.<br/>Should be pretty entertaining, if you ask me, heh.")
('Aaron', 'Anyway, is your little thing with Van going to<br/>be enough?')
('Risette', "Yes. It's only for insurance, but it should suffice for<br/>our needs if it comes to it.")
('Prince Sherid', 'From the look of things, I should be able to give my<br/>father a glowing report.')

(40302, 'Hey, is that a supermodel I see?!')
(40317, 'Whoa, way to up the stakes!')
('Aaron', "That's Gotti for you—giving the people exactly what<br/>they want and more.")
('Risette', 'I suppose, without his preferred star of the parade, he<br/>had to up the ante one way or the other.')
('Van', "Yeah. He might not have won the big award, but<br/>with a parade full of actors and models, he's still<br/>making his mark.")
('Feri', "Come on, Shaheena! You've got this!")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "That's it! You're doing great! Just like that!")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "She's so strong now...and it's all thanks to you guys.")
('Feri', "Aww, I don't know about that. I'd say she gets it from<br/>having such a good sister!")

('Agnès', "If she keeps this up, I'm positive she'll last through<br/>the whole thing just fine.")
('Aaron', "I've gotta say, I was real shocked to see Golden Blood<br/>pull runner up instead of the shiny lion.")
('Aaron', "I still haven't seen Wolves' Requiem. Is it really as<br/>good as they say it is?")
('Van', "Oh, yeah, it's an absolute masterpiece in its<br/>own right. The only other film this year that can hold<br/>a candle to it is Golden Blood.")
('Van', "It's a real timely film, you might say.<br/>Wouldn't surprise me if that was what ultimately put<br/>it on top.")
('Risette', "Plus, if nothing else, it's a good sign the voting<br/>process was genuinely fair despite this being a Vegas<br/>Films event and all that.")
('Agnès', "I want to go see it at some point now, too. I'm really<br/>curious to see how Nina is in it.")
('Feri', "Eh, you can go see it if you want. I'm more interested<br/>in that uncut version of Golden Blood everybody<br/>keeps hyping up!")
('Aaron', "In your dreams, kid. I don't think you're ready for it.")
('Van', "Yeah, I, uhh...have to agree with Aaron on this one.<br/>Maybe once you're a bit older.")
('Feri', "Boo! That's so unfair. I'm plenty mature for my age,<br/>you know!")

(40615, 'Are you feeling tired? I can take over if you—')
('Shaheena', "Tell me. You're not satisfied just being some<br/>substitute for your sister, are you?")
('Shaheena', "You are better than that. You want to shine yet<br/>brighter, don't you? To prove that you deserved the<br/>spotlight from the start.")
('Shaheena', 'Then SHINE! Shine, golden as the sun, and<br/>consume everything around you with your<br/>brilliant rays!')

('Judith', '...')
('Prince Sherid', 'Looks like the worst case scenario we projected has<br/>come to pass.')
('Prince Sherid', 'Naje, get in touch with the Haurvatat. Get them to<br/>provide support to our ground forces.')
('Naje', 'Yes, Your Highness! As you wi—')
(40301, "You might want to come up with a plan B.<br/>We've already got things 'sorted out' there.")
('Naje', 'Tch...')
('Prince Sherid', "You two must be with Almata. I take it you're the<br/>ones behind President Dillon's untimely passing?")
('Prince Sherid', "I think I see what's going on. That device is what's<br/>presumably made everyone out there go into a frenzy.")
('Melchior', 'Smart man. You must be aware of what happened in<br/>Creil and Langport.')
('Melchior', "But enough talk. Let's liven things up some more,<br/>shall we? After all, we owe it to ourselves, as fellow<br/>sponsors, to enjoy this!")
('Dantès', 'That we do. With this, all of the pieces are now<br/>in place.')
('Dantès', "I hope you don't mind keeping us company until the<br/>show's grand finale, Your Highness.")
(40301, "Your Highness! Naje! Do you copy?! ...Damn. I can't<br/>get through!")
(40302, "I've got no choice. I'll have to land this thing in<br/>the oasis!")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "This can't be real. How is this happening...?")
('Van', "It's probably safe to assume the cause of all this is<br/>in there.")
('Van', "If I had to guess, that angel we had a run-in with<br/>delivered its prize straight to Almata's clutches.")
('Agnès', "Yes... I don't see how it could be anything else.<br/>This has to be the work of the fourth Genesis.")
('Risette', "Yet its effects don't appear to be<br/>wholly indiscriminate.")
('Risette', 'The people being controlled must have some sort of<br/>shared connection between them.')
('Feri', "Wait! They're just like those other tourists! Then that<br/>must mean...")
('Aaron', 'Right. Those tainted orbal hookahs are the other<br/>piece of the puzzle.')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "I don't understand! That doesn't explain why my<br/>sister is being affected!")
('Fie', "She's different. That mask she's wearing is what's<br/>giving her grief.")
('Fie', 'Her dancing is amplifying the strength of the<br/>interference, driving these people to act so crazy.')
('Fie', "The question is when she would've gotten that mask<br/>from the culprit.")
('Fie', "Actually, wait—I think I know. It was probably<br/>sometime last night. I knew I should've stuck<br/>with her!")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "Please tell me you're joking...")
('Risette', "There's more. What's going on here bears an awful<br/>resemblance to what took place a year and a half ago.<br/>Wouldn't you agree?")
('Van', "Yeah. Somehow it looks like they've managed to<br/>recreate that effect out here in Calvard.")
('Agnès', "What do you mean 'that'?<br/>(It couldn't possibly be...?)")
('Feri', "Hey, do you know what they're talking about?")
('Aaron', 'Yeah, I heard about it from Cao.')
('Aaron', "They're referring to when that famous dancer was<br/>mind controlled during that takeover in Crossbell.")
('Van', "Claussell, you were in the area when all that was<br/>going down, weren't you?")
('Van', 'Got any ideas on how to break the spell based on<br/>that experience?')
('Fie', "*sigh* I didn't think you'd be so clued in on<br/>what happened.")
('Fie', 'THAT whole crisis was stopped thanks to a bunch of<br/>people coming together in the right places at the<br/>right times.')
('Fie', "But as far as the dancer you're talking about goes, it<br/>was a fellow dancer that ultimately did the trick.")
('Fie', 'She...brought her back from the depths of darkness<br/>and sent that phoenix flying high once more, so<br/>to speak.')
('Van', 'I think we can work with that. What do you<br/>think, Saara?')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "...I'll do it!")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'Whatever chance there is of bringing Shaheena back<br/>to normal, I have to take it!')
('Inspector Daswani', "Urgh! I can't hold out much...longer...")
(40619, 'Ngh...')
(40612, 'Ugh...')
('Shaheena', "Well, if it isn't Saara! Couldn't resist getting a front<br/>row seat to watch me, huh?")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', '...Shaheena.')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "I'm so sorry. I know I haven't been the best<br/>older sister in the world.")
('Shaheena', 'Hey...what are you talking about? You should...<br/>watch...')
('Shaheena', "Yeah! Watch me, sis! I'm gonna shine even brighter!<br/>So bright, I'll turn into a golden sun!")
('Shaheena', "I'll dance for as long as it takes! You won't have to<br/>suffer any longer!")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', '...')
('Risette', "Ms. Saara, take this. It's a spare Xipha.")
('Agnès', 'I set it to activate a spirit jammer. Hopefully it helps<br/>you reach her!')
('Feri', "If anyone's dancing can get through to Shaheena, it's<br/>yours, Saara! You can do it!")
('Van', "We're gonna take care of the source. Sylphid, you be<br/>sure to back her up!")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "...What you're doing right now isn't the dancing that<br/>was passed down to us.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "I'm going to dance some sense into you! As your only<br/>sister, I'll show you how it's really done!")
('Shaheena', "Hahaha! Fine, see if I care! I'll just swallow you up,<br/>too, if that's what it takes!")
('Shaheena', "I have to keep shining brighter! I won't stop!")
('Risette', 'Barrier synchronization via Genesis over 70%!')
('Agnès', 'Van! Now!')
('Van', 'Raaaaaah!')
('Feri', "It's open!")
('Aaron', "Let's get in!")
('Aaron', 'Phew... That was too damn close. You really pushed<br/>our luck by brute forcing it, you know.')

('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Wh-What the heck is this?!')
('Dingo', 'Hey! You all right in there?')
('Van', "Yeah, just peachy. We're gonna go bash some heads<br/>and put a stop to this.")
('Van', "You guys take care of that parade float! Make sure to<br/>contact the CID's Edith branch and the guild, while<br/>you're at it!")
('Dingo', 'All right! Leave it to us!')
('Bermotti', "Aww, you don't have to crack the whip so hard on<br/>your own friends, do you? But I'll give you a<br/>pass, sweetheart. We'll take care of it!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "My head is completely spinning at this point, but you<br/>can be sure I'll be recording everything! The world<br/>needs to know about this!")
('Harwood', 'Hahaha! Now, THIS is what I call a show!')
('Harwood', "What a fine way to recreate what happened<br/>in Crossbell. That mask must originally come from<br/>the workshop, if that's the case.")
('Harwood', "Well, we made use of their Emperor back in the<br/>day so I guess turnabout's fair play.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "Heehee. My, I haven't witnessed such an amusing<br/>little spectacle since the serpent ensnared us.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "That certainly brings back memories... I wonder how<br/>she's doing these days.")
(61381, 'Harumph! Sir, I must ask if you have a reservation<br/>with us.')
(61382, "If you don't, I'm afraid we must ask you to leave!<br/>Raaah!")
('Aaron', 'Oh, great. A pair of muscleheads first thing. Just what<br/>we needed.')
('Van', "We've got no choice. We'll have to take 'em down!")
('Feri', 'That does it. Their strength definitely feels amplified.')
('Risette', 'Indeed, and far more than what we witnessed from<br/>those tourists under the influence yesterday.')
('Van', "We'll just have to take 'em down as we find 'em, as<br/>rough as it'll be. Agnès, how do things look with<br/>the Genesis?")
('Agnès', "Judging from the reaction, I'd say...we need to head<br/>up to the award reception at the top of the hotel.")
('Agnès', 'Nina, Judith, Director Gotti, and the Prince should<br/>all be there as well.')
('Aaron', "Ehh, they've got that scary-ass bodyguard with them,<br/>plus that catgirl. I'm sure they'll be just fine in<br/>the meantime.")
('Van', "There should be an elevator we can take straight up.<br/>Let's hop on board.")
('Aaron', 'Tch. They locked down our ride. Now what do<br/>we do?')
('Risette', 'Maximum security appears to be enabled. It would<br/>take some time in order to crack it.')
('Feri', 'What about this other elevator? It can get us up to<br/>the fifth floor, at least.')
('Van', "We'll take it. We don't have time to waste.")
('Agnès', "Right. We've got to get up there, some way<br/>or another!")
('Director Gotti', 'MAAARVELOUS! This parade is exceeding all of<br/>my wildest dreams!')
('Nina', "It's...beautiful.")
('Judith', 'Yeah. It really is.')
('Judith', "(So that's what it means to perform live. Really puts<br/>into perspective what that girl accomplished<br/>in Crossbell...)")
('Nina', "What'd you say?")
('Judith', 'Just thinking out—ah! Why are you kneeling so close<br/>to me?')
('Nina', 'Sorry! But your injuries need tending to.')
('Melchior', 'Aww. Over already? That was a little anticlimactic, if<br/>you ask me.')
('Melchior', 'What do we do now, boss?')
('Dantès', 'Heh heh heh...')
('Dantès', "I think we're fine. These results were more than<br/>enough for our purposes. I'm sure our spriggan friend<br/>will agree.")
('Van', '...')
('Aaron', 'Wipe that cocky grin off your ugly mug.')
('Feri', "We won't let you escape!")
('Dantès', '...Escape? Whatever gave you that idea?')
('Risette', 'Watch out, everyone!')
('Van', 'Incoming!')
('Nina', 'Aaah!')
('Director Gotti', 'HOLY MOTHER OF AIDIOS!')
('Melchior', 'Whoa, there!')
('Judith', "Taking this a little far, don't you think?!")
('Viola', "Oh, I didn't realize you were there, Melchior.<br/>I'm ever-so sorry.")
('Melchior', 'No need to apologize! You know me, Viola.<br/>I ALWAYS love a good thrill! ❤')
('Olympia', "You have a bad habit of gratuitously pushing people's<br/>buttons, Melchior.")
('Alexandre', 'She does share some of the blame, you realize.<br/>In either case, they are merely engaging in their<br/>usual repartee.')
('Viola', 'The hell I am!')
('Aaron', "It's you bastards...!")
('Agnès', 'Look, that puppeteer is with them, too!')
('Feri', 'Stay RIGHT there!')
('Aaron', 'Gagh...!')
('Melchior', 'Ciao! Thanks for keeping me entertained! ♪')
('Dantès', "Will it or nill it, we seem bound by fate. I'm sure we'll<br/>meet again.")
('Van', 'Not so fast! Tell me one thing!')
('Van', "Just how far do you plan on takin' this madness?")
('Dantès', 'Come now, spriggan. You know the answer as well as<br/>I do.')
('Dantès', 'There are no limits to the lengths we will go.')
('Van', "That stealth cruiser is cutting-edge tech.<br/>These guys're better equipped than I thought.")
('Risette', "So it seems. That specific ship isn't even on the<br/>market yet.")
('Judith', 'Oh, crap!')
('Judith', "W-Well, I'd better get going! I'll let you guys take it<br/>from here! So long!")
('Nina', "Wait! Your wounds, I haven't—")
('Van', 'And there she goes.')
('Feri', "She could've at least said a proper goodbye...")
('Judith', '*huff* *huff* Nina! Are you all right?!')
('Aaron', 'Seriously?')
('Agnès', 'Ahaha...')
('Nina', 'Judith! There you are!')
('Nina', "I've been so worried about you ever since we<br/>got separated!")
('Nina', 'And—oh, no! You look so exhausted! Did<br/>something happen?')
('Judith', "*huff* I'm fine... *huff* Really. I've just been running<br/>around this whole time, that's all.")
('Director Gotti', 'Judith, did you see her? Grimcat was here in the<br/>flesh, baby!')
('Director Gotti', "If she's not a scintillating spectacle, I don't know<br/>who is! That woman is the living embodiment of one<br/>of my 108 ideal forms!")
('Director Gotti', "Aaargh, I've got to do something! I need to get to<br/>work on my next movie—one that'll put that damn<br/>Lam in his place!")
('Nina', 'Ahaha. Already have your eyes on the next prize,<br/>Mr. Gotti?')
('Judith', "Eh, we could all learn a little from his determination.<br/>Though maybe not the part that's waist-deep in<br/>the gutters...")
('Agnès', '(We recovered another Genesis...but at what cost?)')
('Agnès', '(Great-grandfather, Mom, Grandmother...)')
('Van', "Huh, I'd say this whole mess has given us a lot to<br/>chew on.")
('Van', "But our clients are safe and sound—well, mostly—<br/>and I don't think we could've wrapped things up<br/>much better than we did.")
('Van', "I can see us getting a juicy bonus for our work, too.<br/>So good job guys—you all get a passin' grade.")
('Agnès', '...')
('Feri', 'Aww... Heehee.')
('Aaron', "I'm not sure where you get off with thinking you, of<br/>all people, can grade us.")
('Risette', 'I suppose that now all of this is over, this concludes<br/>my current assignment.')
('Risette', 'A job well done, Mr. Arkride. Everyone.')
('Van', 'Right back at you, Risette.')
('Agnès', "I really don't know what we would have done<br/>without you.")
('Agnès', "You've been so attentive and supportive—not to<br/>mention the way you saved Van when he was<br/>in danger.")
('Feri', "Yeah! You've been super helpful to have around!")
('Aaron', "You ever think about trading places with our boss?<br/>Work'd go way smoother with you running the show.")
('Van', "I'm RIGHT here! Though I'd, uh, be lying if I said I<br/>hadn't had the same thought.")
('Risette', 'It was my pleasure. I had a wonderful time working<br/>with all of you.')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', '...Thank you for everything.')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "If it weren't for you all, who knows where I'd be<br/>right now? Arusha must be really looking out for me.")
('Van', "Hey, c'mon, don't sell yourself too short, yeah?<br/>You did all the hard work. We just offered a little<br/>moral support, that's all.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'But still...')
('Feri', "I wish we had more time to hang out! One of these<br/>days, you'll have to teach me some of your<br/>moves, okay?")
('Shaheena', 'Sure! Sounds like a plan!')
('Shaheena', "I promise to pay you back for everything you've done!<br/>See you guys later!")
('Naje', '...I have no excuse for my earlier lapse. Words cannot<br/>express how grateful I am you were able to contain<br/>the situation for me.')
('Prince Sherid', 'That was quite the ride we ended up on indeed.<br/>But all things considered, this has been a<br/>fruitful experience! In several ways.')
('Prince Sherid', 'As promised, I threw in a bonus on top of your base<br/>reward, so you have something extra to look<br/>forward to. It will arrive separately.')
('Van', "'Preciate it, Your Highness. I'll be on the lookout<br/>for it.")
('Prince Sherid', "All that being said, this has certainly been a colorful<br/>little adventure, hasn't it?")
('Prince Sherid', "And I don't just mean with Almata and the Genesis.<br/>You're an intriguing fellow yourself, Van.")
('Prince Sherid', 'I understand what Marduk sees in Arkride<br/>Solutions now. You can most certainly count<br/>on my continued support.')
('Van', "All right—now that we're up to speed on our 4SPGs,<br/>let's hit up the Entertainment District again and see<br/>what's new.")
('Aaron', "Hell yeah. Gotta scope out the hot spots so we can<br/>have some fun tonight. I see what you're doing, man.")
('Van', "I'm not doin' jack except working! Now stay focused!")
(40301, "Whoa, get a load of that guy! He's SO hot!")
(40302, "Wow! You're not kidding!")
(40301, "I think we should maybe talk to him. C'mon, let's<br/>chat him up!")
(40302, "H-Hey, wait! I'm not ready to—")
(40301, "Hey, you. You're real easy on the eyes, you know.<br/>You some kind of rising movie star, by any chance?")
(40301, 'What kind of movies do you act in, huh? Can I get<br/>your autograph?!')
('Aaron', "You're not too far off. I act, but not on the<br/>silver screen.")
('Aaron', "You've got good taste in men, though, I'll give<br/>you that.")
(40301, "Eeek! He just complimented me! I think I'm about<br/>to die!")
(40301, "You busy right now by any chance, hot stuff?<br/>We should go get some drinks! I know a good place<br/>around here, you'll love it!")
('Agnès', 'Umm, actually...')
('Van', "Sorry to burst your bubble, but he's with us. We're all<br/>on the clock right now, as a matter of fact.")
(40301, "Oho! You're not half bad yourself, tough guy! Even if<br/>you're not really my type.")
(40301, "What do you think, hon? Aren't you into old daddies<br/>like him?")
(40302, "Yeah, he's pretty all right... Wait, stop distracting me!<br/>So what if he's prime daddy material? Didn't you just<br/>hear what he said?")
('Van', "...I am NOT a 'daddy'! I'm only twenty-four, damn it!")
('Van', "Ugh, forget it. If you two're lookin' to hook up, go hit<br/>up some other guys. We got work to do.")
('Aaron', "You heard Papa Bear. Tell you what, though. If we<br/>bump into each other later, I'm game to chill with<br/>you ladies. Sound good?")
(40301, 'Aww, but I wanna go out now...')
(40302, 'I am SO sorry about her ambushing you guys<br/>like that.')
(40302, 'You need to chill out, girl! This is exactly why I told<br/>you not to drink in the middle of the day, because you<br/>get like this!')
(40301, "Oh, give it a rest. I haven't had THAT much, really!")
(40302, "Sure you haven't, and your breath smells like a bed<br/>of roses. Come on, let's leave them alone already.")
('Feri', 'Hey, I think one of you dropped something!')
(40301, "Ack, I can't believe I did that! Thanks, sweetheart.<br/>I owe you one.")
('Feri', "What is that thing, anyway? I've been seeing it<br/>around town since we got here.")
('Feri', "It looks like it's for...smoking something.")
(40301, 'Yup! This is what they call an orbal hookah.')
('Agnès', 'A hookah? This is one of the things they sell in the<br/>bazaar, right?')
(40301, "Yep. I guess these orbal models are 'in' around<br/>here nowadays. They're great! All the fun of a hookah<br/>pipe, and it's extra portable!")
(40301, "You girls wanna try a puff or two? I'll let you.")
('Feri', 'Er...')
('Agnès', "We'll pass. We're underage.")
(40302, 'Are you CRAZY?! Your dumb ass just tried to get<br/>these kids to smoke! Think for a sec!')
(40302, "I really am sorry about her, I swear. Come on, let's get<br/>it and go already. You've caused enough trouble.")
('Agnès', 'That woman definitely seems to know how to have,<br/>uh, a good time, I guess.')
('Aaron', "Booze'll do that to you. Man, wish I could get<br/>shitfaced during the day... Lucky girl.")
('Van', "It's festival season. We're bound to run into tourists<br/>living it up.")
('Van', "(That being said, there's somethin' else that smells<br/>about this, and it's not that woman's breath...)")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "You're horrible, Dingo!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'You told me you were still in Edith, and now here<br/>you are, trying to sneak off on me!')
('Dingo', "And? I'm telling you, there's no reason for you to<br/>come all the way out here.")
('Dingo', "Doesn't Tyrell keep its reporters on a pretty<br/>tight leash?")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Oh, don't you worry, I came prepared!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'I got permission from my EIC to scout out the film<br/>festival and do a write-up about it.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Not to mention, the reporter originally slated to<br/>handle the festival had something come up, so<br/>somebody needed to be here, anyway!')
('Dingo', '...It should be illegal to have the kind of luck you do.')
('Van', "Least it explains why you're here two days before the<br/>big event.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Hey, it's the spriggan again! What the heck are you<br/>guys doing here?!")
('Dingo', "You're getting distracted. Listen, I'm not lying. I am<br/>here on personal business, even if it hasn't gotten me<br/>anywhere yet.")
('Dingo', "As for you guys, I see you've got more help than ever.<br/>That new girl of yours looks pretty capable, too.")
('Risette', 'You flatter me. Please, call me Risette Twinings. I am<br/>a concierge working on dispatch from Marduk Total<br/>Security Company.')
('Risette', "It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.")
('Dingo', 'Marduk? As in that—')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Dingo, quit trying to change the subject! I'm not<br/>finished with you!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "You still haven't told me what this 'personal business'<br/>of yours is! Now fess up!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "You know I'll be more than happy to help you with it!")
('Dingo', "What about 'personal business' don't you understand?<br/>I told you, I'm fine.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "But why not? I'm growing as a reporter! I can<br/>handle myself!")
('Dingo', "For starters, it's not exactly a good look, roping in a<br/>reporter working for someone else to pitch in on<br/>my work.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "So what? I don't care about that!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Besides, you helped save me before! It's only fair I<br/>repay the favor.")
('Aaron', "Sounds like our man's trying to keep this business<br/>under wraps. He must be doing a piece on...<br/>unseemly things.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "WHAT?! Th-That can't be it!<br/>...Could it?")
('Feri', "What do you mean, 'unseemly'?")
('Agnès', "Aaron, now look what you've done.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "I can't believe you'd report on something<br/>so despicable! This is exactly why you need to change,<br/>and I'm the girl who's gonna make it happen!")
('Van', "Well, glad we got all that sorted out! Anyway, we'll be<br/>heading out now.")
('Agnès', "(We haven't sorted out anything!)")
('Aaron', '(Trying to bounce real quick, eh?)')
('Dingo', 'Damn it, look at all the trouble you guys have stirred<br/>up now.')
('Dingo', "...Oh, whatever. If I find anything out, I'll hit you up.")
('Van', 'Sounds good to me. Good luck with your<br/>investigating, you two.')
('Judith', '...')
('Nina', 'Oh, hey, everyone! Good morning! Nice to see you.')
('Van', 'Good to see you, too. You seem real perky today.<br/>You guys sleep well after a tiring night?')
('Aaron', "If anyone's tired, I bet it's old Lanster there. You look<br/>like you pulled an all-nighter.")
('Judith', "I...have no idea what you're talking about! I'm as full<br/>of energy as I always am! Believe it!")
('Van', "If you say so. Good to hear you're keeping well rested.")
('Agnès', '...?')
('Agnès', 'Umm, anyway, are you two going somewhere?')
('Nina', "Yeah, we're meeting with Saara and some other<br/>people over at Vegas Films to discuss the parade.")
('Nina', "After that, we've got a basic rehearsal scheduled,<br/>which is looking like it will take a while.")
('Feri', "That sounds tough. Hang in there, girls! I'm sure the<br/>parade's gonna be great!")
('Nina', 'Aww, thank you, Feri.')
('Judith', "All of that is to say that we're going to have our hands<br/>full all day and won't be able to do much else.")
('Judith', "We'd better see you guys start to deliver some results<br/>today, understand?")
('Van', "Yeah, yeah, we'll come through.")
('Van', "We'll be careful not to do anything that'll attract the<br/>attention of, oh, I don't know, local vigilantes.<br/>You've got nothing to fear.")
('Aaron', '(Just had to say it, huh?)')
('Risette', '(Hmm...)')
('Agnès', '(Huh?)')
('Director Gotti', "Gahaha, hello, everyone! What's going on?<br/>How's everyone doing?")
('Nina', "Oh, hello, director. We're doing great, thanks.")
('Judith', "Well, at least physically. Mentally...I've been better.<br/>*sigh*")
('Director Gotti', "I'll take it! You girls better be feeling great, because<br/>with an itinerary this good, tomorrow's parade will be<br/>the best in history!")
('Van', "Sounds like you got some exciting stuff in store.<br/>What have y'all got cookin', exactly?")
('Director Gotti', 'First, the parade will be going through the Cultural<br/>and Entertainment Districts before stopping at the<br/>hotel for the award reception.')
('Director Gotti', 'Then, the winners will be picked up and the whole<br/>thing will go back exactly the way it came.')
('Director Gotti', "But that's all you'll be getting out of me. I can't be<br/>spoiling all of the surprises, now!")
('Director Gotti', "You'll just have to see for yourself what we have in<br/>store as it all unfolds.")
('Director Gotti', "Although I WILL say the performers will be decked<br/>out in outfits made sexy by me personally.<br/>You're gonna love 'em, trust me on this!")
('Feri', "Sexy outfits? You mean it's gonna be a<br/>grownup parade?!")
('Nina', 'It had better not be anything too revealing, or else my<br/>agency is going to have a serious problem with it...')
('Director Gotti', "Anyway! There's still a handful of things left to<br/>hammer out, but we have the shape of it ready.")
('Director Gotti', "Especially now that we've got Saara with us!<br/>That woman is going to be the perfect star!")
('Director Gotti', "She'll be a perfect beacon for just how diverse our<br/>republic really is.")
('Director Gotti', 'Eros runs in the blood of all humans. Our shared<br/>sensuality can transcend race and culture, bringing<br/>our species to new heights!')
('Director Gotti', "There's only one man in Zemuria who can pull off<br/>this show to end all shows, and it's me, baby!<br/>The one, the only, Salvatore Gotti!")
('Director Gotti', 'Gahahaha!')
('Agnès', "...Is Saara going to be okay? I'm starting to<br/>worry, now...")
('Judith', "Don't worry. For all his talk, he's got his head<br/>on straight. Kind of. He won't try to cross any lines<br/>with her...probably.")
('Judith', "And on the off-chance he does do something dumb,<br/>you can bet I'll kick his ass to the curb, so, don't<br/>worry, it's cool.")
('Director Gotti', 'Oh! Yes! Before I forget, you two ladies had better<br/>not forget to practice your award speeches.')
('Director Gotti', "Even I don't know which of you is going to take the<br/>crown as best actress! It'll be a surprise to all of us!<br/>Gahaha!")
('Aaron', "Huh. They haven't posted the results ahead of<br/>time somewhere?")
('Nina', "Oh, absolutely not. They're set to be revealed during<br/>the film festival. None of us nominees know who's<br/>going to win or get runner-up.")
('Judith', "I like it this way. It's more exciting not knowing.<br/>I'm just glad we get to square off again like we did at<br/>last year's festival. Right, Nina?")
('Nina', "You bet! You're going down, Judith!")
('Risette', "Those two make for fine rivals, don't they?")
('Feri', "They really do! It's like they shine together!")
('Director Gotti', "Anyway, to our meeting! We'll get it done quickly<br/>and get back to practice!")
('Judith', "Yeah, we'd better get going. Break a leg, guys.")
('Nina', 'See you all later tonight.')
('Aaron', 'At least one of those girls has got her act together—<br/>unlike a certain bondage bimbo.')
('Agnès', 'What? Who are you...?')
('Feri', "Hey, wait, didn't Mr. Gotti have a request for us, too?<br/>Oh, crap!")
('Van', "You're right. He still needs to fill us in on what<br/>he wants.")
('Van', "Guess we're paying a trip to Vegas Films later, too.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'You guys! You showed up at the perfect time.')
('Aaron', "Hey, look, it's that little reporter girl again.")
('Van', "That 'little girl' is older than you, you know.")
('Aaron', "Physically, yeah, but mentally, I've seen newborns<br/>who were more mature than that chick.")
('Agnès', "Ahaha, aww! Don't be mean.")
('Risette', "You're a reporter with the Tyrell Times, correct?<br/>Do you need something?")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Yeah, I just wanted to ask, uh... Have you guys seen<br/>Dingo recently?')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "I never did manage to get him to fess up to what he's<br/>actually doing here, so I was going to try to get an<br/>answer out of him again.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "But I haven't seen him anywhere all morning! It's<br/>so frustrating! Mrrgrr!")
('Van', "You sure he's not trying to avoid you? The way you<br/>hang on to him, frankly, I wouldn't blame him if<br/>he was.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Excuse me?! I am NOT 'hanging on' to him like<br/>some needy high schooler! Have some respect!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "I just...want to be with him, that's all. F-For work, I<br/>mean, of course!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Besides, any reporter's got to be tenacious in order to<br/>get to the bottom of a story, right?")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "That's not clinginess. That's doing my job.<br/>If anything, I should be more persistent!")
('Aaron', "That's...logic. Of a sort.")
('Feri', "I totally get you! It's like a hunter doing whatever it<br/>takes to track down their prey until they finally go in<br/>for the kill.")
('Feri', "You're one determined lady! I can respect that!")
('Agnès', 'I think that comparison may be a little off...')
('Van', "Ahem. Point is, we haven't seen him and we have no<br/>idea what he's doing out here, either. Your guess is as<br/>good as ours.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "...You're really sure about that? You're not pulling my<br/>leg, are you?")
('Van', "Nah, I'm not. We're in town on our own assignment<br/>and just happened to bump into him while we<br/>were workin'.")
('Van', "(Not that I have NO idea what he might be up to,<br/>but best to keep that to myself until I'm<br/>absolutely sure.)")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Mmm... Well, if you say so.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "There's got to be some reason why he would be out<br/>here for this schlocky excuse for a film festival,<br/>but...what? I don't get it.")
('Van', "If I recall, you weaseled your way into covering this<br/>'schlock' so you'd have an excuse to come out<br/>here, too.")
('Aaron', "I don't know, dude's a pretty big stud, if you ask me.<br/>You sure he isn't shacked up with some actress<br/>or model?")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'WHAT?! C-Could it be? Dingo<br/>s-s-SLEEPING with...')
('Agnès', "Umm... This is just my opinion, but I don't think he's<br/>the kind of man who would—")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'No, I think it might be possible. Yeah, no, I did see<br/>him with a real foxy woman earlier...')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "I can't take this sitting down! I've got to find Dingo<br/>and get to the bottom of this!")
('Agnès', "*sigh* Aaron, look at what you've done now. She's a<br/>boiling steam engine.")
('Feri', 'I feel kinda bad for her, to be honest.')
('Aaron', "Eh, don't feel too sorry for her. I think this<br/>is hilarious.")
('Van', "The whole thing's kind of sweet, at least.<br/>Certainly more so than your wisecracking ass.")
('Van', 'Hey, gumshoe. Any progress in your investigation?')
('Detective Nate', "It's you again?")
('Detective Nate', 'Where do you get off? What makes you think I have<br/>to tell you anything about how my work is<br/>going, huh?')
('Aaron', "I mean, we were the first ones to find the dude.<br/>You can't act like we've got nothing to do with<br/>the case.")
('Inspector Daswani', "Hmph. It's slow going. We still only know the name<br/>of our culprit, Melchior.")
('Inspector Daswani', "And obviously, that's only because he wrote<br/>it himself.")
('Van', "That's a shame. Was hopin' you boys would've found<br/>some leads on where the scumbag might be lurkin',<br/>but guess not.")
('Inspector Daswani', "We don't. We still haven't been able to ascertain how<br/>he broke into the building and then subsequently<br/>got out.")
('Inspector Daswani', 'We were able to confirm from the files left behind<br/>that the victim had connections with organized crime.')
('Inspector Daswani', 'But aside from that grisly graffiti, the perp hardly left<br/>a trace of evidence.')
('Inspector Daswani', "Whoever he is, it's clear he's a skilled assassin who<br/>knows his business.")
('Feri', "That's spooky. Melchior...")
('Risette', 'It would seem finding him will not prove an easy task.')
('Van', "Ehh, it's not like I really expected the cops to turn up<br/>anything in the first place.")
('Detective Nate', "Well excuse the hell out of us! I had to leave my<br/>girlfriend high and dry to investigate the scene,<br/>you know! I'm doing my best here!")
('Van', "Ah, I wasn't tryin' to mock you, man. I'm just sayin'<br/>that's the sort of slippery bastard we're up against.")
('Inspector Daswani', "...It sounds like this isn't your first run-in with this<br/>Melchior character, hmm?")
('Inspector Daswani', 'Putting that aside, the perpetrator remains at large.<br/>I can only hope nothing happens during the<br/>film festival.')
('Inspector Daswani', 'That reminds me. I heard you kids were helping out<br/>with security on the parade. Is that true?')
('Van', "More or less. I wouldn't say it's anything official so<br/>much as just somethin' we'll be doing as part of our<br/>assignment, but yeah.")
('Inspector Daswani', "Hmph. I realize it might be too late to say this, but<br/>don't go stepping into anything too dangerous out<br/>there, understand?")
('Inspector Daswani', 'Leave that kind of work to police professionals.<br/>We can handle it.')
('Risette', 'We appreciate the advice, Inspector. Thank you.')
('Van', "What she said. I'll keep it in mind.")
('Detective Nate', "Come on! Like hell you're going to!")
('Inspector Daswani', '*sigh* What am I going to do with you all?')
('Agnès', 'Ahaha...')
('Agnès', 'Detectives, please do stay safe.')
('Van', "Well, would you look at that! I didn't expect Salvatore<br/>Gotti himself to call in a favor.")
('Van', "I don't know if what he wants is our forte, but never<br/>look a gift horse in the mouth—not from a guy<br/>like him.")
('Agnès', "Heehee! He must've taken a shine to you after your<br/>little discussion yesterday.")
('Agnès', 'Maybe he asked Nina and Judith how to get in touch<br/>with us after that meeting.')
('Aaron', "He could've said something earlier and saved us some<br/>time and effort, though.")
('Feri', 'Oh, give him a break. He seems like a busy guy.<br/>He probably just forgot.')
('Van', "Wouldn't surprise me, yeah.")
('Van', "From the look of things, he's probably over at Vegas<br/>Films workin' on that cavalcade of his some more.")
('Van', 'I do want to check the bulletin board in the Cultural<br/>District, too, but...')
('Van', "I guess we should go talk to him and see what's up.")
('Van', "Well, would you look at that! I didn't expect Salvatore<br/>Gotti himself to call in a favor.")
('Van', "I don't know if what he wants is our forte, but never<br/>look a gift horse in the mouth—not from a guy<br/>like him.")
('Agnès', "Heehee! He must've taken a shine to you after your<br/>little discussion yesterday.")
('Agnès', 'Maybe he asked Nina and Judith how to get in touch<br/>with us after that meeting.')
('Aaron', 'Only problem is, he put two different spots to<br/>meet up.')
('Aaron', 'The hotel and Vegas Films. Does the guy expect us<br/>to toss a coin and just hope we end up at the<br/>right spot?')
('Feri', 'Yeah, where should we go?')
('Van', "Let's check out the hotel first. Might as well see how<br/>the girls are holdin' up today, too.")
('Van', "I still want to check the Cultural District bulletin<br/>board later. We can take a gander while we're<br/>wandering around.")
('Van', "I wanna at least get somethin' done in the meantime.")
('Van', "Looks like Bermotti's got some work for us.")
('Agnès', "He's always so good to us. We should give him<br/>a hand.")
('Van', 'There she is! Over there!')
('Sinem', '*huff* *huff*')
('Agnès', "Hmm... I don't see her anywhere, but she had to have<br/>run into this parking lot.")
('Van', "We're in luck if so. It's a dead end. She'll have<br/>nowhere else to go.")
('Van', "Let's split up and search for her while keeping the<br/>exit sealed off. She won't get away this time!")
('Aaron', "I'll guard the entryway, then. No way in Gehenna<br/>she'll get past me.")
('Feri', "I think I'll go with him. Two guards are better<br/>than one.")
('Van', 'Sounds good. In that case, Agnès, you and I will<br/>search the perimeter.')
('Van', 'Keep a close eye out for her. She could pop out and<br/>try to book it at any time.')
('Agnès', "Right! We'll catch her for sure!")
('Agnès', "(There she is! It's the thief!)")
('Van', "(I'll circle around from the right. You flank her the<br/>other way. All right?)")
('Agnès', '(Okay!)')
('Agnès', 'There you are! We finally found you!')
('Sinem', 'Ah!')
('Agnès', 'Do we really have to keep running? You must be<br/>exhausted at this point.')
('Agnès', 'Can we at least sit down and talk?')
('Agnès', "There's someone who's really concerned about you.<br/>You shouldn't be stealing like this.")
('Sinem', 'Yeah, right! Why should I believe you?!')
('Van', "Will you give it a rest, already? We're tryin' to do<br/>right by you!")
('Van', "You're not gettin' away from us. Just grow up and<br/>turn yourself in already. Runnin' only makes it worse.")
('Sinem', 'Gah! How could I let this happen...?')
('System', 'After much effort, Van and company apprehended<br/>the shoplifter and got in touch with Fazil.')
('System', 'The group decided to rent a room so they could have<br/>a place to talk to the young girl.')
('Marcello', 'Hey, are you the guys I think you are?')
('Van', "Yeah, we're with Arkride Solutions. We're here to<br/>take care of the 4SPG you left.")
('Van', "I take it you're Marcello, the guy who posted it?")
('Marcello', "Yep! I'm your guy! Boy, am I glad to see you!")
('Agnès', "You wrote that somebody's demanding hush money<br/>from you to stay quiet about your 'gray<br/>market business.'")
('Van', 'This merch must be what makes your little enterprise<br/>not quite squeaky-clean, eh?')
('Feri', "Huh? I don't get what the big deal is. He just has lots<br/>of stuff.")
('Feri', 'Though...wait, if you look closely, the brand logos<br/>look weird. What gives?')
('Aaron', "Ahh, I get it. We've got stalls like this back where<br/>I'm from. Except the stuff those guys have tends to be<br/>more bogus looking.")
('Marcello', "Yeah, you've got me. I sell bootleg stuff. Or as I<br/>prefer to say, 'high-quality imitation goods.'")
('Van', 'Heh, sure. Makes you sound just a hair more<br/>respectable, I guess. Still a fraudster at the end of<br/>the day.')
('Marcello', "No, no, that's just the thing. I'm not out to scam<br/>anybody out of their hard-earned mira!")
('Marcello', "I always tell 'em up front that my stuff's fake, so they<br/>know exactly what they're getting when they<br/>purchase it.")
('Feri', 'Wait, really? But why would anybody buy fake stuff if<br/>they could get real ones?')
('Marcello', "'Cause you can get 'fake' and look REAL fancy for a<br/>tiny fraction of the price! There's demand out there<br/>for what I offer, I tell you.")
('Feri', "Oooh! I guess that's one way to look at it.")
('Agnès', "Do the actual makers of the originals know what<br/>you're doing, though?")
('Agnès', "Wouldn't they try to sue you if they found out?")
('Marcello', "Like I said, I'm not out here telling folks that this<br/>stuff's the real deal. That's straight up illegal.")
('Marcello', "But if I sell it all as imitation stuff up front, then I'm<br/>just barely in the clear. At least, that's what I like<br/>to believe...")
('Aaron', "I'm no lawyer, but I'm pretty sure this is all still<br/>against the law.")
('Aaron', "You're making mira riding on the coattails of real<br/>designers without their permission.")
('Marcello', "I mean... You're not wrong. But still...")
('Van', "Straddling that line is how you get by sellin' these<br/>bootlegs in broad daylight.")
('Van', 'Until someone tries to extort you so they keep quiet<br/>about the illegality of it all, that is.')
('Van', "So let's hear it: who's givin' you grief?")
('Marcello', "That's what makes this whole mess so tricky to<br/>deal with. It's a cop who's threatening me.")
('Aaron', "Oh, shit, for real? You're not pulling our leg, are you?")
('Agnès', 'Yeah, I find that a little hard to believe...')
('Marcello', "It's true! If he reported me, best case scenario, I'd be<br/>kicked out of here. Worst case, they'd book me.")
('Marcello', "Bastard says if I don't want that, I have to pay him in<br/>order to get him to look the other way.")
('Marcello', "I've got until tomorrow to get 30,000 mira together or<br/>else he's going to raise hell.")
('Marcello', "Look, I'm not stupid. If getting myself arrested is<br/>what it'll come to, I'll just close up my shop. I don't<br/>want that kind of trouble.")
('Marcello', "But don't you guys think demanding hush money out<br/>of me is absurd?")
('Van', "I don't know if I'd call it absurd, exactly. I see why<br/>he'd do it. But it does tell me this town's got<br/>crooked cops.")
('Marcello', "You bet it does. That's why I reached out to<br/>you folks. I want you guys to track this guy down and<br/>get him to stop.")
('Marcello', "There's nobody else I can turn to. I sure as hell can't<br/>talk to the other cops, and the guild is off limits, too,<br/>given what I do.")
('Marcello', "And there ain't no way I've got 30,000 mira to spare,<br/>my sales aren't THAT good. You guys have to help<br/>me, I'm begging you!")
('Aaron', "That's not for you to decide, pal. ...What's it gonna<br/>be, chief? We doing this, or nah?")
('Marcello', "That dirty cop wanting me to pay up so he'll keep<br/>quiet about my business hasn't gone away, you know.")
('Marcello', 'I need you guys to track down the dirty bastard and<br/>get him to stop!')
('Marcello', "I'm begging you! I need him gone!")
('Van', "I'm not against takin' it up, but we got our hands full<br/>at the moment.")
('Van', 'You mind if we come back and talk to you later?')
('Marcello', "I guess, yeah. I do need you guys focused once we're<br/>doing this. Can't have you distracted with other stuff.")
('Marcello', "Take care of whatever you need to. I'll be<br/>waiting here.")
('Van', "All right, we're on it. We'll have a word with your<br/>cop buddy.")
('Marcello', 'Really? Oh, thank you! Thank you!')
('Van', "Things might not be all that above board here, but<br/>what this guy's doing ain't exactly legal, either.")
('Van', 'With any luck, if we play our cards right, we might be<br/>able to get him to back off without you having to<br/>close up shop.')
('Feri', "But how do we find this bad cop, anyway? That's<br/>the question.")
('Van', "Well, how would you guys go about looking for one?<br/>You kids are smart. I want to hear my<br/>assistants' opinions.")
('Aaron', 'Nice, making your lackeys do all the hard work. I see<br/>how it is.')
('Agnès', "Hmm... It's hard to know where to begin.")
('Agnès', "All we can really gather from the seller's testimony is<br/>that the police officer in question is male.")
('Agnès', "But I'm sure there are lots of male police officers in<br/>this city. That's hardly enough to narrow down<br/>a culprit.")
('Aaron', 'Yeah. Guess our only option is to start chatting up<br/>pigs and see what we can get out of them.')
('Aaron', "Only question is how to approach them. Can't exactly<br/>just waltz up and ask, 'Yo, you got any buddies who<br/>are bribe-takin' rats?'")
('Agnès', 'True. That would just provoke them, and Goddess<br/>help us if we ask the culprit on accident.')
('Feri', 'Hmm...')
('Feri', 'I know! What if we pretend to be customers who lost<br/>money to this seller ourselves?')
('Aaron', 'Huh? You lost me, pipsqueak. What do we get out of<br/>going to all that trouble?')
('Feri', 'I was thinking it could give us an idea about what the<br/>police are doing about our client in the first place!')
('Feri', "If we know what they're doing about guys like him,<br/>maybe that'll give us a clue that points us toward<br/>whoever's threatening him.")
('Agnès', "Oh, I see! That's a smart idea, actually!<br/>Good thinking, Feri!")
('Aaron', "Sounds like we're going to have to pound some<br/>pavement, but hell if I can think of anything better<br/>to do. I'm game.")
('Feri', "Aww, I didn't think it was that clever! But...think<br/>it'll work?")
('Van', "Yeah, that idea's got potential. Pretty sharp for a<br/>newcomer, actually.")
('Van', "We'll try your idea and see what it gets us. Now,<br/>let's roll.")
('System', 'Quest Hush Money started!')
('Officer Kelvin', "Ugh, just once, I wish it wasn't so blisteringly hot...")
('Van', 'Sorry to bug you, pal. Got a minute?')
('Officer Kelvin', 'Sure. You guys need something?')
('Van', "Yeah, we just realized we got scammed into buyin'<br/>some fake souvenirs by a street vendor we ran into.")
('Van', "We tried to demand our money back, but the guy<br/>won't hear any of it.")
('Officer Kelvin', "Ah, bootlegger trouble, huh? Yeah, we've got a<br/>handful of those around the city.")
('Officer Kelvin', 'I feel your pain. Those guys are smooth talkers.<br/>They can get you to part with your money before you<br/>know it.')
('Agnès', "You're telling us. Is there anything you can do<br/>to help?")
('Officer Kelvin', "Well...I'm going to be frank with you. Dealing with<br/>those guys is like playing a game of cat and mouse.")
('Officer Kelvin', 'You can file the papers and serve them a warrant, but<br/>another one will spring up and take their place.')
('Officer Kelvin', "It's a pain to be out some money, but it probably<br/>wasn't that much you lost in the grand scheme of<br/>things, right?")
('Feri', 'I guess so...')
('Officer Kelvin', "Then I'd just take the hit and move on, sad to say.<br/>Be glad that's all it cost you to learn how things work<br/>around here.")
('Aaron', "Oh, it's our fault we got scammed, is that it?<br/>I thought the good, upstanding officers of the law<br/>were supposed to care about justice.")
('Officer Kelvin', "Don't get preachy with me, kid. Fact is, we've got our<br/>hands full and we have to pick our fights carefully<br/>right now.")
('Officer Kelvin', "With all the security we have to provide for the actors<br/>and venues, we're swamped as it is with this damn<br/>film festival.")
('Officer Kelvin', "Hell, we've had to call in additional help from other<br/>precincts so we have enough boots on the ground!")
('Officer Kelvin', "Look, I get you might not like it, but we straight up<br/>don't have time to pursue every little thing that comes<br/>up right now.")
('Officer Kelvin', '(It sucks for me, too. All these damn tourists make it<br/>tough to skip out on the job. *sigh*)')
('Van', 'I heard that, you know.')
('Van', "But if that's the way it is, I think we're done here.<br/>C'mon, guys.")
('Van', "All right, I think that's enough sleuthin' around<br/>for now. We got a bombshell to deal with already.")
('Feri', "We do? I mean, we talked to a bunch of people, but it<br/>sure didn't feel like we heard anything that big.")
('Aaron', "Speak for yourself. There's one part that's definitely<br/>been nagging at me.")
('Agnès', "Me, too, although I'm not certain whether it's<br/>especially significant.")
('Feri', "Whaaa...?! You're telling me I'm the only one that<br/>didn't pick up on it?! Man...")
('Van', "You'll figure it out once we check back in with the<br/>stall owner.")
('Van', "Let's head back to his place and touch base.")
('Aaron', "(Okay, time to hit up another cop and see what<br/>they've got to say.)")
('Feri', '(Sounds good to me!)')
('Van', '(I know the seller said the cop threatening him was a<br/>guy, but best not to leave any stone unturned when<br/>investigating things.)')
('Van', "'Scuse me. You got a second to talk?")
('Officer Vernier', 'Sure, no problem. What can I do for you?')
('Van', 'Yeah, we just realized we got scammed into buying<br/>some fake souvenirs by a street vendor we ran into.')
('Van', "We tried to demand our money back, but the guy<br/>won't hear any of it.")
('Van', "Is there anything you can do to help? Doesn't feel fair<br/>for the guy to leave us high and dry like that.")
('Officer Vernier', "Oh, wow, that's unfortunate. I'm really sorry you had<br/>to deal with that.")
('Officer Vernier', "If this were any other time, I'd be more than happy to<br/>go over and try to help you all. Unfortunately...")
('Officer Vernier', 'With the film festival nearly upon us, we really have<br/>to pick and choose what problems get priority<br/>attention right now.')
('Feri', "Does that mean you won't be able to do<br/>anything today?")
('Officer Vernier', "Sadly, yes. Damn it...those bootleggers are a real<br/>handful, just in general. It's difficult for us to keep<br/>them in check.")
('Officer Vernier', "But just to be clear, I do absolutely intend to help.<br/>I don't want scum like him to get off scot-free.")
('Officer Vernier', "I'll give you a complaint form. Once you've filled it<br/>out, can you bring it to the station when you<br/>have time?")
('Officer Vernier', "It'll have to wait until after the festival, but you can be<br/>sure I'll recommend he's at least warned, if not<br/>outright removed.")
('Agnès', "That's fair. We can do that. Thanks for taking the<br/>time to listen to us.")
('Van', "All right, I think that's enough sleuthin' around<br/>for now. We got a bombshell to deal with already.")
('Feri', "We do? I mean, we talked to a bunch of people, but it<br/>sure didn't feel like we heard anything that big.")
('Aaron', "Speak for yourself. There's one part that's definitely<br/>been nagging at me.")
('Agnès', "Me, too, although I'm not that confident it's<br/>that significant.")
('Feri', "Whaaa...?! You're telling me I'm the only one that<br/>didn't pick up on it?! Man...")
('Van', "You'll figure it out once we check back in with the<br/>stall owner.")
('Van', "Let's head back to his place and touch base.")
('Van', "(Okay, time to hit up another cop and see what<br/>they've got to say.)")
('Van', "Hey, buddy. How's your hot date going?")
('Detective Nate', "Don't call me 'buddy'! We are NOT friends! I'm not<br/>interested in shooting the breeze with you!")
('Detective Nate', "Oh, but of course, that doesn't apply to you, Agnès!<br/>If you ever need help with anything, I'm always happy<br/>to talk.")
('System', "Little cozy with her, aren't you, babe? Look at you,<br/>talking to another woman while you're on a date with<br/>your girlfriend.")
('Detective Nate', "I-It's not like that, sweetie, I promise! I only meant<br/>I'd talk to her in my capacity as a policeman!")
('Agnès', 'Ahaha...')
('Agnès', '(I thought we should try asking Detective Nate about<br/>the crooked policeman, since it is his line of work<br/>and all.)')
('Agnès', "(But if he's here off duty, then...)")
('Van', '(Yeah. Not to mention that he might not have much<br/>to say about that or the bootlegger in general.)')
('Aaron', "(That's my thinking. Could end up being more<br/>trouble than it's worth in the end, talking to him.)")
('Feri', '(Yeah. Guess we better back off and look elsewhere.)')
('Marcello', '...So, you went straight to the source and talked to the<br/>cops, huh? Makes sense, I guess.')
('Marcello', "How'd it go? Did you guys manage to turn anything<br/>up about that crooked ass?")
('Van', "Oh, we turned up quite a lot. In fact, I'd say we just<br/>about hit the jackpot.")
('Van', "I'm confident that we found your man.")
('Marcello', 'Already?! That was fast!')
('Feri', "Wait, we have?! I didn't realize that at all!")
('Agnès', 'I can understand that. It was easy to miss, but there<br/>was one officer that rubbed me the wrong way with<br/>what he said.')
('Aaron', "Well, if you're feeling so confident, it's got to be that<br/>one, right?")
('Van', "I want to bring you over so you can confirm whether<br/>or not we've got the right person. You mind comin'<br/>with us?")
('Marcello', "Sure, no problem. I couldn't forget that face even if<br/>I tried! I remember it clear as day.")
('Marcello', "Did you happen to catch a name? I'm curious.")
('Van', 'Of course. Our dirty cop is none other than...')
('Van', '(Our best guess is Officer Kelvin.)')
('Van', "(Wait, no it isn't. It can't be him. Guy's got a clear<br/>lack of commitment to his job, but that's a separate<br/>thing entirely.)")
('Van', '(Our best guess is Officer Vernier.)')
('Van', "(Wait, no it isn't. It can't be her. She didn't say or do<br/>anything that stuck out as being all that suspect.)")
('Van', "Officer Camilo. Least, that's what he claims to go by.<br/>Who knows if it's legit?")
('Feri', 'What? THAT guy?!')
('Feri', 'Are you for real?! He seemed super nice!')
('Feri', 'Out of everyone we talked to, he was the most fired<br/>up to help us.')
('Van', "Exactly. That's problem number one.")
('Van', "Vernier was willin' to hear us out, too, but she herself<br/>said that the local bootleggers're hard to shut down.")
('Van', "And as Kelvin put it, tryin' to bring 'em is in like cat<br/>and mouse. They'll just scatter everywhere on you and<br/>crop up again later.")
('Van', "Plus with the festival occupyin' the force's attention,<br/>they're in no position to devote resources to anything<br/>other than serious crimes.")
('Agnès', "That's right. Despite that, Officer Camilo very clearly<br/>said he would absolutely arrest the seller who<br/>'scammed' us.")
('Agnès', "It wouldn't be all that unusual if he was simply that<br/>dedicated to his job, but you have to remember...")
('Agnès', 'When we mentioned it was this stand specifically, he<br/>suddenly sounded a lot less interested in helping us.')
('Marcello', "Huh, that's strange. What does it all mean?")
('Aaron', "Think about what you would do if you weren't on<br/>the up-and-up. It all starts to make sense.")
('Aaron', "Our man in blue wasn't interested in helping us.<br/>He was just looking for a NEW mark.")
('Aaron', 'A new mark that he can try and squeeze hush money<br/>out of in the exact same way he has with you.')
('Aaron', "But once he realized he'd already hit you up, he<br/>suddenly had a bunch of reasons why trusty law<br/>enforcement can't help us today.")
('Marcello', 'That makes sense. I can see how someone like him<br/>would think like that.')
('Feri', 'Hmm... But so far, all that shows is that he looks like<br/>he might be crooked.')
('Feri', "Don't we need more evidence before we can pin the<br/>blame on him?")
('Van', "Funny you should say 'looks.' That's the second<br/>problem with him, actually.")
('Van', "We can't rule out that he might not be police at all,<br/>let alone a rotten cop. We may well be dealin' with<br/>an impostor.")
('Marcello', 'Oh, damn! Are you serious?!')
('Marcello', "But he was clearly wearing his uniform when I talked<br/>to him! That makes him about as legit as it gets,<br/>doesn't it?")
('Aaron', "That uniform is exactly what's wrong with him.<br/>It looked off to me, too.")
('Feri', "Oh, yeah! Now that I think about it, his clothes did<br/>look newer than the other officers we talked to.<br/>I hadn't thought about that.")
('Agnès', 'Tharbad is a desert city with a lot of sand<br/>blowing around. Officers try to stay neat, but it<br/>should be a bit of a struggle.')
('Agnès', "Obviously, it's not impossible that it's a coincidence<br/>and his uniform just happens to be brand new, but...")
('Agnès', "When you think about that, and the way he talked to<br/>us, that's enough to lean toward him being<br/>the culprit.")
('Van', "Yep. Couldn't have said it better myself.")
('Feri', 'When you guys put it like that, I can see what makes<br/>him suspicious! We should definitely talk to<br/>him again.')
('Marcello', "That asshole. I tried to be polite with him, thinking<br/>he was an authority figure, and now it turns out he's<br/>not even a real cop!")
('Marcello', "He won't get away with making a mockery of me!<br/>Where is he? I'll kick his ass!")
('Van', 'Whoa, slow down there, buddy.')
('Van', "If our hunch about him being an impostor's right, we<br/>gotta tread with caution.")
('Marcello', "What? Why? What's the big deal?")
('Agnès', "Pretending you're a policeman isn't exactly a<br/>casual prank. It's flagrantly illegal, and<br/>extremely risky.")
('Agnès', "So the fact that he's doing so, in full broad daylight,<br/>in a massive city, must mean...")
('Aaron', "He's got bigger fish to fry. He's after something more<br/>than just shaking down random hawkers for shits<br/>and giggles.")
('Van', "Exactly. Until we figure out what exactly it is our<br/>man's after, it's best to try negotiating with him while<br/>trying to suss out what's up.")
('Van', "Let me handle the talkin' here, all right? You keep<br/>your distance from him. We don't want<br/>anything happenin'.")
('Feri', "Don't worry! We'll do our best to make sure you<br/>come out on top!")
('Marcello', "Gah, I hate not being in control of the situation...<br/>All right. I'm trusting you guys to come through!")
('Van', '(All right, now with that settled, we should probably<br/>take this guy over to see Officer Camilo.)')
('Van', '(All right, now with that settled, we should probably<br/>take this guy over to see Officer Camilo.)')
('Van', "We'll bring you over there in a bit. There's somethin'<br/>else we need to take care of first.")
('Marcello', "No problem. I'll be here!")
('Marcello', "Phew, I owe you guys. You've done a ton for me.")
('Marcello', "Thanks again for everything. I'll make sure your<br/>reward is worth it.")
('Van', "Hey, we won't say no. Just...keep the bootlegs to<br/>yourself, all right?")
('Marcello', "Ha! Don't worry, I wasn't going to pull that on you.")
('Agnès', "I'm a little concerned about what he said right at the<br/>end, before he took off, though.")
('Feri', 'Yeah, he said something about a brother... Maybe it<br/>was code for an accomplice?')
('Feri', "I agree with what Van said. It sure felt like he wasn't<br/>just here to threaten people. But what else could he<br/>be doing?")
('Aaron', "Doesn't matter. Not our problem as long as it doesn't<br/>come up in our work. Let the cops and bracers<br/>sweat it.")
('Van', "My thoughts exactly. All we can do is hope that<br/>whatever it is doesn't land on our desk in the future.")
('Van', "Just keep it in the file cabinet, and in the meantime<br/>let's find some more work to do.")
('Agnès', "How are you feeling, Marcello? You're not too hurt,<br/>are you?")
('Marcello', "Nah, nothing I can't handle. I shouldn't have charged<br/>in and confronted the guy like that, anyway.")
('Marcello', "I definitely owe you guys. You've done a ton for me.")
('Marcello', "Thanks again for everything. I'll make sure your<br/>reward is worth it.")
('Van', "Hey, we won't say no. Just...keep the bootlegs to<br/>yourself, all right?")
('Marcello', "Ha! Don't worry, I wasn't going to pull that on you.")
('Agnès', "Still, it sounds like there's another guy like him if<br/>they're called the 'Devancy Brothers.'")
('Feri', "Yeah, I can't believe we confronted a<br/>wanted criminal! It sounded like they just stuck to<br/>Edith before. Wonder why they're here?")
('Aaron', "Probably thinking they can use the commotion from<br/>the film festival to make a killing while the killing's<br/>good, plain and simple.")
('Aaron', "If his brother is out there, it's probably safe to<br/>assume he's already up to no good, whatever it is.")
('Van', "Agreed. All we can hope is that whatever he's<br/>doing, we don't get more work on our desks because<br/>of it.")
('Van', "Just keep this all in the file cabinet, and in the<br/>meantime let's find some more work to do.")
('System', 'Quest Hush Money completed!')
('System', 'Earned')
('System', 'Received')
('Caravan Chief Osman', "Hmm... Guess it's not coming back on its own<br/>anytime soon, is it?")
('Caravan Chief Osman', 'I better round it up soon or else its load could be in<br/>real trouble... *sigh*')
('Feri', "Hey, is it just me or does that guy look like he's<br/>in trouble?")
('Aaron', "Haven't you heard curiosity killed the cat? Keep your<br/>nose out of trouble, small fry.")
('Agnès', "Well, it might not be that bad. Maybe it's a problem<br/>we can help with.")
('Agnès', 'Not to mention, it might be a good way to get to<br/>know the area and the state of it.')
('Van', 'Well, we are in the area. Might as well see what<br/>he needs.')
('Van', "Hey, my man. What's wrong? You look a little<br/>annoyed about something.")
('Caravan Chief Osman', 'Huh? Who are you guys?')
('Van', "Arkride Solutions. We specialize in problems that<br/>can't be left to the police or Bracer Guild.")
('Van', "We work out of Edith, but we're out here to handle<br/>an assignment.")
('Van', "Dependin' on what's bothering you, we might be able<br/>to sort it out.")
('Caravan Chief Osman', 'You could? Oh, that would be great!')
('Caravan Chief Osman', "Wait, you said you specialize in problems that can't<br/>be entrusted to the police or the guild, right?")
('Caravan Chief Osman', "Does that mean you won't handle anything that falls<br/>outside that?")
('Agnès', "Not necessarily! Why don't you tell us what's<br/>going on?")
('Caravan Chief Osman', 'Well, you see, I make my living distributing fruit<br/>in Tharbad.')
('Caravan Chief Osman', 'This time, I thought I could save a few mira by not<br/>hiring any escorts and getting through the Sandsea all<br/>on my own.')
('Caravan Chief Osman', "I figured it would be fine. It's a route I know like the<br/>back of my hand. No big deal! Ah, was my<br/>deal-sense off.")
('Caravan Chief Osman', 'A vicious sandstorm hit that completely threw off my<br/>sense of direction. And then, of course, monsters had<br/>to attack.')
('Feri', "That sounds awful. I'm glad you made it out in<br/>one piece!")
('Aaron', 'Sounds like mother nature made you pay for your<br/>hubris big time.')
('Caravan Chief Osman', 'Did she ever. Fortunately the entire caravan made it<br/>out of that mess alive, by the skin of our teeth.')
('Caravan Chief Osman', 'UN-fortunately, it was only when we got here that I<br/>realized the last camel that was supposed to bring up<br/>our rear had gone missing.')
('Caravan Chief Osman', "And that's a big problem. That animal is carrying rare<br/>food that I'd really rather not lose, if I can help it.")
('Caravan Chief Osman', "I need to hurry out there and search for that camel<br/>and the food, but I'm not sure what to do...")
('Van', "Tell me more about this 'rare food' it's haulin' around.<br/>What sort of stuff are we talking about, exactly?")
('Caravan Chief Osman', "Have you ever heard of raw cacao? It's pretty obscure,<br/>so I doubt you—")
('Van', "I'm sorry, did you say raw cacao?!")
('Feri', "Oh, yeah! That was the rare ingredient inside that<br/>melfita stuff we had earlier, wasn't it?")
('Aaron', "I don't get what the big deal is. I can imagine what<br/>it's like easily enough if it's like regular old cacao.<br/>It can't be that special.")
('Van', "That's where you're wrong, my friend. Sounds like<br/>someone needs a crash course on cacao and how<br/>it works.")
('Van', "Cacao beans are the base ingredient of chocolate.<br/>You get 'em from inside cacao pods that grow<br/>on trees.")
('Van', 'Now, the thing about those cacao pods is that they<br/>also have this pulp that can be used, too.')
('Van', "And that pulp happens to be the raw cacao.<br/>Your average marketplace doesn't usually<br/>carry 'em, so they're a hard find.")
('Caravan Chief Osman', "That's exactly right. You know your stuff! Color<br/>me impressed.")
('Van', "Course. I'm a man who can't live without some good<br/>ol' chocolate, so I've been dyin' to have raw cacao at<br/>least once.")
('Van', "It's supposed to have a sweet, yet sour profile, but<br/>with a little bitterness thrown in that makes<br/>it addictive. A real Central Eastern delicacy.")
('Aaron', "We get it, dude, it's the greatest thing on the<br/>Goddess' green earth or whatever. You don't have to<br/>give us a lecture about it.")
('Aaron', "And what do you mean you 'can't live without<br/>your chocolate'? You make it sound like you'd croak if<br/>you don't get your fix.")
('Agnès', "(There goes Van. There's nothing stopping<br/>him now...)")
('Feri', "Wow, I'm learning a lot today! Now you've got me<br/>curious what it's like, too!")
('Caravan Chief Osman', 'If you guys are that interested in it, I can let you all<br/>sample some of it.')
('Caravan Chief Osman', "Assuming you can find my camel that's carrying my<br/>stock of it, mind.")
('Van', "(It's not every day you get a chance to dine on some<br/>genuine raw cacao straight from the source.)")
('Van', "(This might be something the guild could totally<br/>handle, but hell if I'm gonna let 'em edge me out<br/>of this!)")
('Caravan Chief Osman', 'If you guys are that interested in raw cacao, I can let<br/>you all sample some of it.')
('Caravan Chief Osman', "Assuming you can find my camel that's carrying my<br/>stock of it, mind.")
('Van', "(It's not every day you get a chance to dine on some<br/>genuine raw cacao straight from the source.)")
('Van', "(This might be something the guild could totally<br/>handle, but hell if I'm gonna let 'em edge me out<br/>of this!)")
('Van', "Argh... I'd love nothin' more than to take you up on<br/>this, but could you wait just a little while?")
('Van', "We're in a big hurry and need to take care of<br/>somethin' else first. After that, we'll be free.")
('Caravan Chief Osman', 'Well, as you like.')
('Caravan Chief Osman', "I don't know what could be so urgent, but I can give<br/>you folks a little time if you need it. Go ahead.")
('Van', "We don't usually take this sort of work, but...I'll make<br/>an exception this time. We'll take the job.")
('Caravan Chief Osman', "Are you sure you can handle it? I don't want to<br/>pressure you, but you'd be doing me a huge favor.")
('Agnès', "Well, if our boss says it's okay... Besides, we don't<br/>want your camel to come to harm. We'd be more<br/>than happy to help.")
('Feri', 'Yup! We get to save an innocent critter AND have<br/>some yummy food afterwards. This is the best<br/>job ever!')
('Aaron', 'Yeah, look at us—real pack of professionals here.')
('Aaron', "I was interested in checking out those sand<br/>dunes, though. Seems like I could get a decent<br/>workout there, so hell, I'm game.")
('Van', "Then we're all in agreement. We're off to the desert<br/>to find that camel.")
('Van', 'Before we take off, do you happen to remember<br/>where exactly you were attacked by those monsters?')
('Caravan Chief Osman', "Hmm... Let me think... You know, believe it or not,<br/>I'm pretty sure it was actually close to town.")
('Caravan Chief Osman', "Looking at the map, once you're in the sand dunes<br/>and head a little to the west, you'll find the spot.")
('Van', "Got'cha. West it is.")
('Van', "I have to imagine that camel can't have gotten all<br/>that far. It must still be wandering around<br/>there somewhere.")
('Van', "We'll start at the site of the attack and fan out<br/>around that.")
('Aaron', 'Sounds good to me.')
('Agnès', "We'd better hurry. We don't want that camel<br/>getting hurt!")
('System', 'Quest Hump Hunt started!')
('Caravan Chief Osman', 'Phew, thanks a ton! You kids saved my hide!')
('Caravan Chief Osman', "You guys were out there so long, I was starting to get<br/>worried I'd sent you to danger or worse!")
('Caravan Chief Osman', 'Thanks for dragging this poor guy back. Now I can<br/>finally rest easy, and get on with my business!')
('Van', 'It took a little effort to track him down, but by<br/>Aidios, we still managed to wrangle him up.')
('Aaron', 'I was expecting to get a little exercise out of our<br/>desert trek, but it gets pretty rough out there.')
('Agnès', "Definitely. The glare from the sun is so intense, not<br/>to mention all those clouds of sand. I'm glad we're<br/>back in town.")
('Feri', "That's okay, 'cause all that effort's finally about to<br/>pay off!")
('Feri', "We're gonna be able to have some of that<br/>cacao, right?!")
('Van', "That's what we're about to find out.")
('Van', 'The cacao pods themselves looked just fine. But what<br/>about the pulp? Is the raw cacao inside still okay?!')
('Caravan Chief Osman', 'Well, about that...')
('Caravan Chief Osman', 'I opened one of the pods up...and luckily, there was<br/>hardly any damage inside at all!')
('Caravan Chief Osman', "It's a miracle they emerged out of that ambush in<br/>this state. I'm incredibly grateful.")
('Caravan Chief Osman', 'So, yes, you all have definitely earned some raw cacao.<br/>I took it and made some juice with it for you all.')
('Caravan Chief Osman', "It's got a distinct flavor to it, but hopefully you'll<br/>like it.")
('Agnès', "Wow, it's white! I would've thought cacao pulp would<br/>be dark in color, like chocolate. That's so interesting.")
('Feri', "Yeah, it doesn't resemble chocolate at all, but it still<br/>looks amazing! I can't wait to try it!")
('Van', "Makes sense. You'd need the beans in order for it to<br/>be brown.")
('Van', "Anyway, this stuff isn't going to drink itself.<br/>Here goes!")
('System', 'Van and the others took a sip of their raw cacao juice.')
('Aaron', "Well, damn. This stuff's pretty legit.")
('Agnès', 'Yeah, I feel more energized just drinking it.<br/>It reminds me of fruit juice from the south.')
('Agnès', "I'm also amazed at how different it tastes compared<br/>to melfita, despite coming from the same plant.")
('Feri', "It's just a little bitter, but that doesn't stop it from<br/>being really smooth to drink. I like it!")
('Van', "Hell yeah. This is even better than what I'd heard.")
('Van', 'The balance of sweetness and sourness is just perfect!<br/>I could see myself getting addicted to this stuff.')
('Van', "I'm impressed it doesn't take much pulp to get such a<br/>dense flavor, too. Definitely somethin' only mother<br/>nature could cook up.")
('Van', "Really, it's wild you can make such different things<br/>with the same cacao pod between this stuff<br/>and chocolate.")
('Caravan Chief Osman', "I'm glad you all like it so much! Sounds like I made<br/>the right choice rewarding you with it, then.")
('Caravan Chief Osman', "I'll be sure to deposit some good, hard mira as soon as<br/>we're done here, of course.")
('Van', "Sounds like a plan. Thanks for the drinks.<br/>Couldn't have asked for a better bonus.")
('Caravan Chief Osman', "Not at all! I'm the one who's grateful. You went out<br/>and saved my camel's life! That was no small feat.")
('Caravan Chief Osman', 'I can only thank Arusha for guiding us to<br/>one another! Farewell, friends!')
('System', 'Quest Hump Hunt completed!')
('System', 'Received')
('Harold', 'I see... So you guys want to know about that<br/>green-haired bracer?')
('Harold', "Yes, I remember him, all right. Quite clearly, as a<br/>matter of fact. We don't see many customers<br/>like him.")
('Feri', 'Really?! Tell us more!')
('Harold', 'He came around here about an hour ago, while out<br/>on patrol.')
('Harold', 'But there was something about him that looked a<br/>little...odd.')
('Harold', 'He was watching the other patrons for some reason,<br/>as if he was trying to size them up or some such.')
('Harold', "I think he might've been investigating something.<br/>Is that what brings you here, too?")
('Van', "Yeah. Somethin' like that.")
('Van', 'You happen to see if this bracer talked to anyone?')
('Harold', 'Let me think... Ah, yes, I remember him trying to<br/>strike up a conversation with one man who was<br/>playing alone.')
('Harold', 'The police were also making their rounds at the time.<br/>When he noticed them approaching, he was rather<br/>quick to depart.')
('Aaron', "Still trying to avoid getting spotted by the cops,<br/>sounds like. For someone acting so brazen, this guy's<br/>a real chickenshit.")
('Agnès', "I'm a little concerned about him staring at the other<br/>visitors like that, too.")
('Harold', 'Indeed. The more that we talk, the more hindsight<br/>makes me feel something was amiss with him.')
('Harold', "In any case, I'm afraid that is all that I can share<br/>about the bracer in question.")
('Harold', 'I can only guess what you would want with him.')
('Harold', 'But regardless, I wish you all luck in your endeavors.')
('Van', 'Well, thanks for your time—and for the hot tip, too.')
('Van', "Okay, folks, let's see if anyone else caught wind of<br/>our sneak.")
('Risette', 'As you wish.')
('Detective Nate', "Huh? You say you're looking for a<br/>green-haired bracer?")
("Nate's Girlfriend", 'Yeah, we saw a guy like that. He came up and talked<br/>to us earlier today, as a matter of fact.')
('Van', "Heh, no kidding? I was just trying my luck in askin'.<br/>Didn't expect you all to have actually seen the guy.")
('Detective Nate', "Yeah, well, congrats. Now will you guys scram?<br/>We're in the middle of a date!")
('Aaron', "Oh, come on. What's a little favor between<br/>friends, huh?")
('Aaron', "Just tell us what you know about that nerd and we'll<br/>get right outta your hair.")
('Aaron', 'Believe me, last thing any of us want is to interrupt<br/>your little tryst, right as it was getting good.')
('Detective Nate', "We are NOT friends! And the best way to 'get right<br/>outta my hair' would be to not stroll up and talk<br/>to me in the first place! Ever think of that?")
('Detective Nate', "Oh, but that doesn't apply to you, Agnès! If you ever<br/>need help with anything, I'm always happy to talk!")
("Nate's Girlfriend", "Little cozy with her, aren't you, baby? Talking to<br/>another woman while you're on a date with<br/>your girlfriend. Points for bravery, I guess.")
('Detective Nate', "Gah, uh, it's not like that, sweetie, I promise! I only<br/>meant I'd talk to her in my capacity as a policeman!<br/>There's nothing between us!")
('Agnès', 'A-haha... Y-Yes...')
('Aaron', "Well, someone's in hot water. Look, all I'm saying is,<br/>we're not here to crash your date.")
('Aaron', "Just tell us what you know about the guy and we'll be<br/>gone like your reputation with your lady friend there.")
('Detective Nate', "Ngh... You punks have a way of pushing my buttons.<br/>Fine, let's talk.")
('Detective Nate', 'Long story short, we were talking to your<br/>green-haired bracer just a bit ago.')
('Detective Nate', 'He asked if we were having trouble with anything<br/>and offered to help.')
('Van', 'Just outta the blue like that? Interesting. And<br/>then what?')
('Detective Nate', 'Nothing, really. He cut things short and then took off<br/>for somewhere.')
('Detective Nate', "Looking back on it, that wasn't really, I dunno,<br/>bracer-like of him to do.")
("Nate's Girlfriend", "Babe, don't you remember? He ran away after you<br/>said there was nothing to worry about, because you're<br/>a cop.")
("Nate's Girlfriend", 'Maybe it was just me, but it felt like he got really<br/>tense as soon as you mentioned that.')
('Detective Nate', "Oh, yeah. I guess he did, didn't he? Huh.")
('Risette', '(The rest of this story is completely unremarkable.)')
('Risette', '(However, the fact that he was so concerned about<br/>police attention certainly stands out.)')
('Van', "(Mm-hmm. Feels like we're startin' to close in on<br/>the guy.)")
('Van', "Thanks for fillin' us in. Sorry to eat up so much of<br/>your time. Go on and enjoy the rest of your<br/>spriggan-less date.")
('Detective Nate', 'It WAS spriggan-less until you idiots showed up!')
('Detective Nate', "*sigh* I don't know what you all are investigating this<br/>time, but you better not cause trouble for the police,<br/>got it?")
('Van', "Okay, folks, let's see if anyone else caught wind of<br/>our sneak.")
('Risette', 'As you wish.')
('Van', "All right, think we've talked to enough folks that we<br/>can paint a decent picture of what's going on.")
('Van', "Let's find someplace quiet to talk and see what we've<br/>come up with.")
('Risette', 'In that case, might I suggest that area over there?')
('Van', "Now that we're all settled, let's go over what<br/>we know.")
('Van', "First, this green-haired bracer's shown some weird<br/>behavior for a guy in his line of work.")
('Van', "He's overly leery of cop attention, even for a bracer,<br/>and was sizing up customers at the casino.")
('Van', "Which is to say, that's no bracer's act. He's rollin' like<br/>a petty thief.")
('Risette', 'Which would make sense, if his bracer appearance is<br/>simply a disguise.')
('Agnès', 'This is starting to sound a lot like that man<br/>impersonating a policeman earlier today...')
('Van', "Yup. And just like then, goin' around impersonating a<br/>bracer's not the kinda heat most're gonna wanna risk<br/>gettin' nicked for.")
('Van', "No, this smells like a case of greed gettin' the better<br/>of a guy while he's working toward something else.")
('Feri', "Oh, yeah. That 'Officer' Camilo was one of the<br/>Devancy Brothers that are wanted by the<br/>police, right?")
('Feri', 'Could the bracer be the other brother?')
('Van', "I'd put good odds on it, yeah. Impersonating a bracer<br/>can get you in some real trouble, for obvious reasons.")
('Van', "If he gets caught, there's hell to pay for that alone,<br/>never mind his other stuff.")
('Van', "And that's why he's got to be doing something worth<br/>the risk. You don't go to that trouble just to steal<br/>some wallets.")
('Van', "There's a decent chance he got distracted by the<br/>prospect of easy pickings on his way to something a<br/>lot more hardcore.")
('Feri', "Man, this hole just goes deeper and deeper the more<br/>we talk about it. That's crazy!")
('Aaron', 'Whatever it all is, our main problem right now is that<br/>all the eye-witness reports we have come from stuff<br/>that just took place.')
('Aaron', "For a guy who seems to be wanderin' around looking<br/>for suckers to rob, he doesn't exactly have a whole lot<br/>to show for it.")
('Aaron', 'Which could mean...')
('Agnès', 'That since he already successfully robbed someone<br/>after getting in their car, he could be thinking of<br/>trying that again.')
('Van', "'Xactly. That's my hunch.")
('Agnès', 'Is there any way we can put a stop to him before<br/>he targets anyone else?')
('Risette', 'Actually, I may have a suggestion toward that end.')
('Risette', 'If we assume that the perpetrator is going to target<br/>the driver of a car with a flat tire, as he did before...')
('Risette', "Then why don't I conduct a wide-area search for<br/>potential car targets among the ones driving in to<br/>Tharbad this evening?")
('Van', "Uh, damn. You can do that? That'd save us a lot<br/>of trouble.")
('Risette', "Indeed I can. It's a form of shard-based<br/>information analysis.")
('Risette', 'Well, then, I shall initiate the search. Starting now...')
('Risette', 'Search complete. ...Oh? What do we have here?')
('Risette', 'As it happens, there appears to be a car stranded near<br/>the entrance to the city.')
('Aaron', "Bingo. If this guy's gonna strike again, odds are good<br/>that's our mark.")
('Van', "Yeah. Let's keep an eye on that car's signal while we<br/>stake out this so-called bracer. See if he finally<br/>shows himself.")
('Van', "With how close that car is, it should only take a few<br/>minutes for it to pull into town. We'll go to the<br/>parking lot and wait there.")
('Feri', 'Sounds good to me!')
('System', 'Several minutes after commencing the stakeout in the<br/>parking lot...')
(40302, "Man, I don't know how we would've made it here if it<br/>weren't for you.")
(40303, 'Seriously! Thank you so much!')
(40301, 'Oh, no problem! Just happy I could help at all, really.')
(40301, "I only did a quick fix, though. You really should take<br/>ol' reliable here into a mechanic later and have it<br/>looked at by a professional.")
(40302, "Will do. Thanks again for everything! But isn't there<br/>something we can do to repay you? I feel bad, not<br/>doing more.")
(40301, "Don't worry. All in a day's work for a bracer.<br/>Your thanks is its own reward.")
('Aaron', 'Oh, it is, huh? Sure helps when you can nick a reward<br/>of your choice, to boot.')
(40301, 'Huh?! What the—')
('Aaron', "Got'cha, pal. You're not going anywhere.")
(40303, "Eek! What do you think you're doing?!")
('Van', "Sorry to scare you folks. We're with<br/>Arkride Solutions.")
('Van', "We've been on the trail of this guy for reasons that'll<br/>become clear in a moment.")
(40302, "What? Why? He's a bracer! What could he have<br/>possibly done wrong?!")
(40301, "Get your hands out of there! That's—")
('Feri', 'And there it is! A wallet!')
('Feri', 'Does this happen to belong to you guys?')
('System', 'Feri handed the wallet to the tourists.')
(40302, "What in—?! Yeah, that's mine! I had it stashed inside<br/>my bag, on the back seat.")
(40302, 'Are you telling me this bracer stole it?!')
('Van', "That's exactly it. And that's just the start.")
('Van', "Just so you all don't get any wrong ideas about<br/>bracers: you should know this guy's a fraud.")
('Agnès', 'This may sound like a strange question to ask, but did<br/>you two get a flat tire on your way to town tonight?')
(40302, 'Y-Yeah, we did, actually. I figured it was because it<br/>was such a long drive.')
(40303, "Luckily, this bracer happened to come across us and<br/>offered to help. That's how we got here.")
('Agnès', "So, that's the problem... It is very likely he is the one<br/>who punctured your tire in the first place.")
('Agnès', 'He seems to have this method where he bursts a tire<br/>and then pretends to be passing by before offering to<br/>repair it.')
('Agnès', 'He then hitches a ride back to town and steals<br/>whatever he finds in the back seat.')
('Agnès', "Isn't that right? If I got some part of it wrong, now's<br/>the time to correct me.")
(40301, '...Ggh.')
(40302, 'By Aidios... So he was pretending to be a bracer all<br/>along just so he could rob me.')
(40303, "I didn't sense anything wrong at all! If you guys<br/>hadn't shown up when you did, we'd have been<br/>completely clueless.")
(40301, "And whose fault is that, huh? That's what you get for<br/>trusting someone just because they say they're a<br/>bracer, ya morons!")
(40301, 'So what if I maybe took things too far this time<br/>because they were so easy to sucker? Who cares?')
(40301, 'Go ahead and turn me in. At the end of the day, our<br/>objective is still within reach.')
('Agnès', '...! So there IS more going on! What are<br/>you planning?')
(40301, 'Heh heh heh. Who can say?')
(40301, "Once we get our hands on THAT, they'll be able to<br/>post bail for me, no problem. It'd be a drop in<br/>the bucket.")
(40301, 'Take me to the bracers or police or whoever<br/>you want. See what I care!')
('Aaron', "Ooh, looks like we've got a sassy one on our hands.<br/>I think this guy needs to be taught a lesson he<br/>won't forget.")
(40301, 'Do your worst, dirtbag! I dare you!')
('Van', "Put it in park, kid. There's no need for us to rake him<br/>over the coals personally.")
('Van', "We'll turn him in to the guild, and then he'll be<br/>their problem. That way, they'll owe us a favor for<br/>saving their reputation.")
('Risette', 'In that case, I shall contact the Bracer Guild so<br/>arrangements can be made.')
('Risette', 'Although before I do so, I must say, Mr. Arkride, this<br/>has been a rather impressive exercise.')
('Risette', "It's been a true honor and a pleasure to finally see for<br/>myself how such a renowned spriggan goes about<br/>his business.")
('Van', "Agh, I don't need to be buttered up. Thanks, but just<br/>ring 'em up already so we can get on with the rest of<br/>our night.")
('Risette', 'Heehee. As you wish.')
('System', "Upon receiving Risette's call, a bracer team rushed to<br/>the scene, taking the emerald-haired impostor into<br/>custody themselves.")
('System', 'As for the tourists, they were subsequently brought to<br/>both the guildhouse and police to testify about what<br/>took place.')
('System', 'Similarly, Van and the others also visited the Bracer<br/>Guild to offer their own report on the matter.')
('Director Gotti', 'Oh, I meant to ask! Did you all catch my post?')
('Director Gotti', "Seeing as I hadn't heard from you all, thought I'd<br/>reach out myself.")
('Director Gotti', 'And I figured, what better way to do that than with<br/>a 4SPG? Judith and Nina told me how to file one,<br/>and now, here we are!')
('Van', "Yep. Exactly why we're here.")
('Feri', 'We forgot to ask about it earlier, so we wanted to<br/>hurry back and check in with you.')
('Director Gotti', 'Right, sorry about that! Got my hands full with<br/>everything right now, as you can imagine.')
('Director Gotti', 'Anyway! What say we get straight to business and<br/>discuss what I have in mind for this gig?')
('Director Gotti', 'You kids got time to talk right now?')
('Director Gotti', "I'd really like to sit down and go over this gig in detail<br/>with you all as soon as possible.")
('Director Gotti', 'Any chance we can get the ball rolling now?')
('Van', 'Wish I could say we could, but...')
('Van', "...unfortunately, we got some other business that we<br/>should probably take care of first, if that's cool.")
('Director Gotti', "Well, if it's that urgent, don't let me get in your way.")
('Director Gotti', "Come back and talk to me once you have a minute.<br/>I'll make time for you!")
('Van', "Yeah, let's get down to brass tacks.")
('Director Gotti', 'Fantastic! Then come over here, so we can sit<br/>and chat.')
('Van', "Right, so you wrote in your request that you're lookin'<br/>to add some more cast members to the cavalcade.")
('Aaron', "Pushing your luck just a bit trying to rope more folks<br/>in when the festival's tomorrow, don't you think?")
('Director Gotti', 'Quite the opposite, as a matter of fact!')
('Director Gotti', "We're done getting ready for the parade. At this<br/>point, I'm just interested in making it even better<br/>while we still have time!")
('Director Gotti', "That's why I was hoping to spruce things up around<br/>the back of the parade with some hot girls! Give the<br/>joint even more pizzazz!")
('Feri', "Huh? You're looking for girls? You didn't<br/>mention that.")
('Director Gotti', "Who else would I look for? But I'm not just looking<br/>for babes. I need ones who can dance a bit.<br/>Nothing complicated, so don't worry there.")
('Agnès', "Are you certain we're going to be able to find<br/>someone like that on such short notice?")
('Agnès', 'The town may have a lot of visitors right now, but<br/>this request needs a very specific skillset, if you<br/>ask me.')
('Director Gotti', "Bah, Tharbad is filled to the brim with women as<br/>talented as they are foxy. You'll have no trouble!<br/>I'm sure of it!")
('Director Gotti', "But I will admit it's not entirely out of the realm of<br/>possibility that you kids could come up short.")
('Director Gotti', "But that's fine! Because if that happens, I've got a<br/>backup plan, and that backup plan is you there, miss!<br/>What do you say? Could you do it?")
('Risette', 'Truly? You would like me to join your parade?')
('Feri', 'Oh, wow, yeah! Risette is super pretty! She would<br/>totally kill it on stage!')
('Aaron', "No argument there. I got a feeling she could pull off<br/>whatever 'dance' you have in mind.")
('Agnès', "She certainly could. But it should really be<br/>her decision. We can't force her to do it.")
('Risette', 'Well, I appreciate the high praise, even if I feel it is<br/>perhaps a little much.')
('Risette', 'Very well. If necessary, I will at least consider joining<br/>your parade.')
('Director Gotti', "Damn, you mean that?! Screw bringing in anyone<br/>else, I'd be happy just roping you—")
('Van', "Hold on there, Mr. Gotti. Strictly speakin', Risette<br/>ain't one of my employees. She's on loan<br/>from elsewhere.")
('Van', "That in mind, I really don't wanna impose on her if<br/>we can avoid it.")
('Van', "So if you don't mind, I'd rather go out and see who<br/>we can find in town, like you asked. That still work<br/>for you?")
('Director Gotti', "Augh, all right. If that's the way it has to be.")
('Risette', 'Thank you for being understanding of my position.')
('Van', 'No prob. Getting back on topic, though...<br/>Ideally, how many ladies do you want us to try and<br/>get in on this?')
('Director Gotti', "I mean, I'd gladly take as many beautiful women as<br/>you can find. The more the merrier!")
('Director Gotti', "But...if I had to give you a hard number, in terms of<br/>how many our plans can fit, I'd say three's our limit.")
('Director Gotti', "I want you to find at least one, though. Once you get<br/>to work, that's what I'll be counting on! All right?")
('Risette', 'Understood. To confirm, we should recruit at least<br/>one woman and at most three,<br/>circumstances permitting.')
('Director Gotti', "Yes! I want the best you can find! I'm counting on<br/>you kids to have good taste, taste that'll deliver!")
('Director Gotti', "And with that settled, I'm going to the training studio<br/>to plan out how to incorporate the additional talent.")
('Director Gotti', "Happy hunting! Don't come back until you can bring<br/>me girls who'll knock me off my feet!")
('Van', "That dude's brain definitely has one setting and one<br/>setting only, if you know what I mean.")
('Risette', 'That was my first time seeing Mr. Gotti in person.')
('Risette', 'He certainly lives up to his reputation as a man with<br/>an...uncompromising vision. His passion for the<br/>parade is extremely evident.')
('Agnès', "You can say that again. We'll have to be careful who<br/>we recruit to have any hope of satisfying him.")
('Feri', 'But where do we even start looking? Should we just<br/>wander around town and pray to Arusha?')
('Aaron', "If you want hot girls who can dance, it can't hurt to<br/>hit up the nightclub to see if anyone there's willing to<br/>play ball.")
('Van', "Y'know, for once that's a decent idea.")
('Van', "I'm drawin' a blank on other ideas, so prayers and vice<br/>dens it is.")
('Van', "We'll walk around town and see if we get lucky as we<br/>make our way over to the club. Let's roll.")
('System', 'Quest Extra, Extra! started!')
('Van', 'Say, I recognize that policewoman over there.')
('Feri', "Yeah, she's one of the ones we talked to for that<br/>assignment yesterday.")
('Van', "Got a real dignified look to her. Fit, too, as<br/>you'd expect.")
('Van', 'I think she could dance her heart out, if she<br/>wanted to.')
('Agnès', "Then what are we waiting for? Let's ask if<br/>she's interested.")
('Officer Vernier', 'Hello. Is there something I can help you with?')
('Officer Vernier', "Wait a moment. Didn't I see you all yesterday?")
('Van', 'You did. We got some new business this time.')
('Van', "Basically, we're with Arkride Solutions. We take on<br/>odd jobs for clients who are in unique pinches,<br/>let's say.")
('Van', "Anyway, Director Salvatore Gotti's got us pitchin' in<br/>on his Carnal Cavalcade that's comin' up tomorrow.<br/>You've heard of it, I bet.")
('Van', "We're recruitin' some additional folks to fill out the<br/>cast and wanted to know if you were interested.")
('Officer Vernier', 'What? You want ME to join?!')
('Feri', "Umm, wait! Before you answer, miss, can you dance<br/>at all? We're looking for folks who can dance at least<br/>a little.")
('Officer Vernier', "I...suppose I can dance, yes. I wouldn't say I'm great<br/>at it, either, but I can.")
('Feri', "Then does that mean you'll do it?!")
('Officer Vernier', "Well, it's an honor just to be asked to join one of Mr.<br/>Gotti's productions. I never would've imagined this.")
('Officer Vernier', "But I'm an officer, first and foremost, and I'm<br/>assigned to festival security tomorrow. I'm afraid I<br/>have to decline.")
('Agnès', "That's fair. Have to imagine the police here'll be<br/>incredibly busy once things kick off.")
('Aaron', "That settles it, I guess. Looks like this one's a wash.")
('Officer Vernier', 'I am really sorry. Good luck finding someone!')
('Risette', 'Suffice to say, that officer would be rather difficult<br/>to recruit.')
('Risette', "But it seems like you haven't quite given up yet, have<br/>you, Mr. Arkride?")
('Van', "Nope. I can't help but think a parade like that would<br/>really let her show off the inner strength she usually<br/>gives to the badge.")
('Van', "And we're dealin' with Gotti as a client here.<br/>We can't fold that easily if we're gonna make<br/>him happy.")
('Van', "There's got to be another way to get her to join.")
('Aaron', 'Like what, exactly?')
('Van', "Well...we could try negotiatin' with<br/>Inspector Daswani. I would bet he's her boss.")
('Van', "If we frame it just right, maybe, just maybe, we'll get<br/>what we want in the end. Can't hurt to try.")
('Van', "So I figure Detective Nate's around here somewhere.")
('Van', "Let's talk to him first, see if there's not a way for us to<br/>get in touch with Daswani.")
('Inspector Daswani', '...You people. What do you want this time?')
('Van', "Good to see you, Inspector. You're exactly the man in<br/>the force we need to talk to.")
('Van', "Long story short, Salvatore Gotti's called in a request<br/>with us.")
('Van', 'He wants us to find a few more women to join his<br/>Carnal Cavalcade tomorrow.')
('Van', "We tried asking Officer Vernier from Tharbad's<br/>force, but she turned us down.")
('Van', "Said she'd be too busy working the security detail to<br/>help out.")
('Inspector Daswani', "*sigh* Of all the things you could've asked, of course<br/>it's something completely frivolous.")
('Inspector Daswani', "We're already short on officers working the parade.<br/>I can't shave more officers off on top of that.")
('Detective Nate', "Exactly. 'Sides, why's someone like Gotti got you<br/>people running around? Doesn't he have assistants for<br/>this sort of thing?")
('Detective Nate', 'And why are you so fixated on one of our officers?<br/>There are plenty of other women you could ask.<br/>Leave our crew alone.')
('Van', "Now, now, I'm not saying you folks have to give her<br/>time off. It's just, what if she 'works security'<br/>elsewhere in the parade?")
('Van', "Y'know, put her in the back of it. Mix her in with the<br/>other cast members, have her escort and protect<br/>the performers.")
('Inspector Daswani', "You can't be serious, Arkride.")
('Van', "No, hear me out. Say the parade gets some hecklers<br/>who try throwin' garbage or somethin' at<br/>the performers.")
('Van', "If you had Officer Vernier posted in the parade itself,<br/>she could handle it right there. Practically killin' two<br/>birds with one stone.")
('Inspector Daswani', '...')
('Aaron', 'If you ask me, that sounds like a good way to beef up<br/>security for the event. Cover all the bases.')
('Aaron', "Really, I don't see what you guys have to lose letting<br/>her go. If anything, you stand to gain from it.")
('Detective Nate', 'That...actually makes a lot of sense.')
('Inspector Daswani', "...I can't believe what I'm about to say.<br/>Sometimes I'm too soft for my own good.<br/>You hooligans always have a way with words.")
('Inspector Daswani', "Fine, you win. Since it sounds like it's in our own<br/>interests, too, I'll put in a word for her and see<br/>what happens.")
('Inspector Daswani', "At the end of the day, it's true that you can never be<br/>too secure. Any means we can take to strengthen<br/>security is worth pursuing.")
('Agnès', 'Thank you so much, Inspector! We really<br/>appreciate it!')
('Inspector Daswani', "She'll likely get an official call about it from the<br/>higher ups later, but if you could go ahead and tell<br/>her, I'd appreciate it.")
('Van', 'Can do. Thanks again, Inspector.')
('Officer Vernier', 'Oh, we meet again. Need something else?')
('Van', 'Sorry to keep bugging you. We actually wanted to<br/>follow up on our earlier talk about the parade.')
('Van', 'We talked to Inspector Daswani, and he agreed to<br/>reach out to HQ on your behalf and pull some strings<br/>to let you do it.')
('Officer Vernier', "What?! Really? You're not pulling my leg, are you?")
('Agnès', "No, not at all. The idea is that you'll still be providing<br/>security, just from within the parade itself as one of<br/>the performers.")
('Agnès', 'From what we were told, you should be officially<br/>notified about the change in your post soon.')
('Officer Vernier', "I don't believe it. How did you guys convince the<br/>brass to change plans? Just who are—")
('Officer Vernier', '...No way.')
('Officer Vernier', "Sorry, I've got a call from HQ coming in. I need to<br/>take this. It should just be a moment.")
('Van', 'No problem. Take your time.')
('Officer Vernier', 'Yes, this is Officer Vernier, on patrol. Over.')
('Officer Vernier', '...What?!')
('Officer Vernier', 'Ahem. Sorry, I mean, copy that. Yes, I can<br/>handle that. No problem. Over and out.')
('Officer Vernier', 'Tharbad Police HQ just ordered me to change<br/>positions during the parade.')
('Officer Vernier', 'They asked me to join the Carnal Cavalcade as one of<br/>the performers and provide security for the cast<br/>members from the inside!')
('Van', 'Nice. Glad to hear the inspector came through for us.')
('Van', "So now you should make sure to stop by Vegas Films.<br/>You'll want to talk to Mr. Gotti and see what he has<br/>in mind for you.")
('Officer Vernier', "That's no problem at all. Thanks for going to all that<br/>trouble for me! I'll see you later.")
('Aaron', "Nice. That's one dancer added to the crew.")
('Aaron', "Gotti said he wanted at least one dancer, but<br/>ideally three. So what's the play? Keep looking?")
('Van', "Yeah, if we could find three dancers, that'd be for<br/>the best.")
('Van', "But if we have trouble findin' anyone else, there's no<br/>harm cutting things short here.")
('Risette', 'Perfectly reasonable. Shall we continue<br/>searching, then?')
('Agnès', 'If we decide to call it quits, we can head back to<br/>Vegas Films and talk to Mr. Gotti.')
('Feri', "Yes, another dancer for the parade! We're making<br/>it happen!")
('Van', "At this point, it's probably perfectly fine for us to call<br/>it good and report back to Gotti, if need be.")
('Van', 'Finding a third girl is a big question mark. But it<br/>never does hurt to try.')
('Agnès', 'Yes. I vote that we keep looking a little longer and see<br/>what we can find before deciding what to do.')
('Agnès', "That's three new dancers recruited for the parade!")
('Van', 'It sure is. Time to make our way back to Vegas Films<br/>and tell Gotti the good news.')
('Van', 'Well, here we are, back at the nightclub.')
('Van', "Come to think of it, are they even gonna be open<br/>right now? It's the middle of the day.")
('Aaron', "Maybe not. Don't hear anything coming from inside.")
('Feri', 'Well, poot. Should we turn around and look<br/>someplace else?')
('Aaron', "Not yet. Gotta imagine there's at least a handful of<br/>folks around, gettin' stuff ready for tonight.")
('System', 'Aaron put his hand on the door and tried pulling<br/>it open.')
('Aaron', "Knew it! Door's open. Might as well stroll inside and<br/>have a look around.")
('Agnès', "What?! Are we, umm, sure about this? I don't know<br/>that we should walk in uninvited...")
('Van', "Eh, it'll be fine. If anyone's there, we've got an offer<br/>they'll find interesting. I'm sure they'll hear us out.")
('Van', "I say we go in. If anyone asks, we'll tell 'em we got<br/>urgent business.")
('Aaron', 'Jackpot! That chick over there ought to do nicely.')
('Van', "Definitely. She's obviously a pro. She knows exactly<br/>what she has to offer and how to show it.")
('Feri', "Well, let's go ask her, then!")
('Juliana', 'Oops, looks like I forgot to lock up when I went out<br/>to buy some smokes.')
('Juliana', "Sorry, folks. We're not open. I'll have to ask you to<br/>leave and wait for nightfall.")
('Van', "We know. Apologies for bursting in. We're lookin'<br/>for someone specific who can help us with a<br/>last-minute arrangement.")
('Van', 'Quick question: you interested in the Carnal<br/>Cavalcade at all?')
('Juliana', 'What, you mean the big parade tomorrow?')
('Juliana', "Of course I am! I love Salvatore Gotti's movies!<br/>That parade should be amazing!")
('Juliana', "Knowing him, it's going to be the sexiest, most<br/>spectacular thing around! I know I work here, but I'll<br/>recognize game when I see it!")
('Juliana', "Heck, I'm so excited for it, I took paid time off<br/>tomorrow to enjoy it from the VIP seats.")
('Risette', 'My, my, you certainly sound like a devoted fan of<br/>Mr. Gotti.')
('Aaron', "Well, you're in luck, 'cause you're going to love what's<br/>coming next.")
('Van', "We're with Arkride Solutions. As it so happens,<br/>we've been retained by Mr. Gotti to help him<br/>with somethin'.")
('Van', "Specifically, he's looking to add a few more girls to<br/>the parade. Would you be down for it?")
('Juliana', "WHAT IN ARUSHA'S NAME?! Are you people<br/>for real?!")
('Agnès', "Completely for real. All Mr. Gotti needs is someone<br/>who can dance 'a little'. I'd guess you can do more<br/>than that.")
('Juliana', "Honey, who do you think you're talking to?")
('Juliana', "I work as a pole dancer. You bet your fancy ass I'm<br/>used to dancing for a crowd! Hell, I'll show everyone<br/>out there how it's done!")
('Juliana', "Aah, I can't believe this is happening! Never in a<br/>million years did I think I'd do something like THIS!<br/>Now I'm even more excited!")
('Feri', 'So we have a deal? Great!')
('Van', "So now you should make sure to stop by Vegas Films.<br/>You'll want to talk to Mr. Gotti and see what he has<br/>in mind for you.")
('Juliana', "You got it! I'll redo my makeup and then go<br/>introduce myself. Gotta make sure I look the part!")
('Aaron', "Nice, that's one dancer added to the crew.")
('Aaron', "Gotti said he wanted at least one dancer, but<br/>ideally three. So what's the play? Keep looking?")
('Van', "Yeah, if we could find three dancers, that'd be for<br/>the best.")
('Van', "But if we have trouble findin' anyone else, there's no<br/>harm cuttin' things short here.")
('Risette', 'Perfectly reasonable. Shall we continue<br/>searching, then?')
('Agnès', 'If we decide to call it quits, we can head back to<br/>Vegas Films and talk to Mr. Gotti.')
('Feri', "Yes, another dancer for the parade! We're making<br/>it happen!")
('Van', "At this point, it's probably perfectly fine for us to call<br/>it good and report back to Gotti.")
('Van', 'Finding a third girl is a big question mark. But it<br/>never does hurt to try.')
('Agnès', 'Yes. I vote that we keep looking a little longer and see<br/>what we can find before deciding what to do.')
('Agnès', "That's three new dancers recruited for the parade!")
('Van', 'It sure is. Time to make our way back to Vegas Films<br/>and tell Gotti the good news.')
('Van', "Sorry to bother you two while you're talking. Mind if<br/>we ask somethin'?")
('Nino', 'Sure, go ahead.')
('Cervi', 'Huh? Why are you looking at me? Is there something<br/>I can do?')
('Van', "We're with Arkride Solutions. Salvatore Gotti's called<br/>in a favor with us that we're trying to help him<br/>out with.")
('Van', "Basically, we're looking for additional folks to join<br/>tomorrow's Carnal Cavalcade. You interested?")
('Nino', "You're working for SALVATORE GOTTI?!")
('Cervi', 'And you want me to be in the parade?!')
('Aaron', "Heh, guess it's safe to say they didn't see that<br/>one coming.")
('Nino', 'But why do you want Cervi to help, of all people?')
('Nino', "Not to diss her to her face, but she's just a<br/>regular woman. I don't know if she'd fit in with<br/>something like that.")
('Cervi', "Hey, so much for 'not dissing me to my face'! I know<br/>I'm not special, but do you have to say it like that?")
('Van', "You say that, but...when I look in your eyes, beneath<br/>those glasses, I see a certain spark in 'em. A fire<br/>deep within.")
('Van', "I can tell you've got this unquenchable sense of<br/>adventure and curiosity. A determination to see<br/>things through.")
('Van', "That's exactly the spirit Mr. Gotti wants in<br/>his parade. More spice for what's already shaping up<br/>to be a zesty event.")
('Cervi', "Wow... I don't know what to say. You really get me!<br/>That's exactly who I am!")
('Cervi', "So, it just so happens we've been making our own<br/>independent movie, and we brought it to Vegas Films<br/>to have them take a look at it.")
('Nino', "We've been so focused on production stuff, I<br/>completely forgot the film festival was even going<br/>to happen!")
('Nino', "We're so lost. We were just fretting over what we<br/>should even do next.")
('Nino', "If you really feel like that, I think you should do<br/>it, Cervi. Get out there and leave your mark! I'm sure<br/>you'll do great!")
('Cervi', "Well, I don't have any aspirations to become a<br/>professional performer or anything. My heart's set on<br/>being a creator.")
('Cervi', "But if it's an opportunity to meet someone like Mr.<br/>Gotti, then...I accept! I'd be thrilled to do it!")
('Feri', "Umm, wait! Miss, can you dance at all?<br/>We're looking for folks who can dance at least a little.")
('Cervi', '...')
('Nino', 'Erm. Cervi, you might want to—')
('Cervi', "I-I'll be fine, really! Just because I'm not athletic<br/>doesn't mean I can't dance when push comes<br/>to shove! I'll show everyone I can do it!")
('Van', "That's...a little worrying, but at least<br/>you're enthusiastic. I'm sure that'll carry you. I think.")
('Van', "Anyway, head inside Vegas Films when you're ready.<br/>Your man Gotti will want to speak with you.")
('Cervi', "Sounds good! I promise you, you won't regret this!")
('Nino', 'Uh, Cervi, you might want to practice a little before<br/>going in. Just a thought.')
('Aaron', "Nice. That's one dancer added to the crew.")
('Aaron', "Gotti said he wanted at least one dancer, but<br/>ideally three. So what's the play? Keep looking?")
('Van', "Yeah, if we could find three dancers, that'd be for<br/>the best.")
('Van', "But if we have trouble findin' anyone else, there's no<br/>harm cuttin' things short here.")
('Risette', 'Perfectly reasonable. Shall we continue<br/>searching, then?')
('Agnès', 'If we decide to call it quits, we can head back to<br/>Vegas Films and talk to Mr. Gotti.')
('Feri', "Yes, another dancer for the parade! We're making<br/>it happen!")
('Van', "At this point, it's probably perfectly fine for us to call<br/>it good and report back to Gotti.")
('Van', "Findin' a third girl is a big question mark. But it never<br/>does hurt to try.")
('Agnès', 'Yes. I vote that we keep looking a little longer and see<br/>what we can find before deciding what to do.')
('Agnès', "That's three new dancers recruited for the parade!")
('Van', 'It sure is. Time to make our way back to Vegas Films<br/>and tell Gotti the good news.')
('Director Gotti', "We meet again! So, how's the hunt coming along?<br/>Find any girls to round out my cavalcade yet?")
('Van', "(Should we call it a day and report back to Gotti?<br/>Or keep lookin'?)")
('Van', "Oh, yeah. It's goin' great.")
('Van', "In fact, if you've still got time to wait, we'd be happy<br/>to keep searchin' some more and get back to<br/>you later.")
('Director Gotti', "Absolutely! You can't rush art! I'm just dying to see<br/>what kind of ladies my man and his team can line up<br/>for me.")
('Van', "Hang in there just a bit longer, Mr. Gotti. We'll be<br/>back with a lineup for the ages before you know it.")
('Director Gotti', "Absolutely! You can't rush art! I'm just dying to see<br/>what kind of ladies my man and his team can line up<br/>for me.")
('Van', 'We sure have. You got time for us to fill you in?')
('Director Gotti', 'Of course! Show me your own cavalcade!')
('System', 'Van contacted everyone that the group managed<br/>to scout. Before long, they assembled at Vegas Films.')
('Director Gotti', "Great work, spriggan! I knew you were the right man<br/>for the job. You knew just what I was looking for.<br/>I'm completely blown away!")
('Director Gotti', "It's like you were reading my mind! When I think<br/>beautiful women, THIS is exactly what I like to see!")
('Van', "Well, like you said before, Tharbad's not exactly<br/>hurtin' for ladies who are as capable as they are easy<br/>on the eyes. That definitely helped.")
('Cervi', "Oh, stop it, you guys! You're going to make me blush!")
('Cervi', "But never mind that. I can't believe I'm standing right<br/>next to the real Salvatore Gotti!")
('Cervi', "I'd love to shake your hand later. Or maybe, could I<br/>ask you to look at our independent film? That would<br/>mean the world to me!")
('Officer Vernier', "I may still technically be on duty, but I can't believe I<br/>get to take part in something led by you, Mr. Gotti.")
('Officer Vernier', 'You can count on me to help make sure this is going<br/>to be a fun parade!')
('Juliana', 'By the Goddess, I am such a big fan of<br/>yours, director!')
('Juliana', "I might not be QUITE as hot as your actresses, but<br/>you'd better believe I can still put on a hell of a<br/>scintillating show!")
('Director Gotti', 'Gahaha! Now THIS is the kind of energy I like<br/>to see! This is perfect!')
('Director Gotti', "All right, time for a trip to the dressing room! It'd be<br/>a waste to have all this beauty on display without the<br/>threads to match it!")
('Agnès', "Does this mean we get a sneak peek at what everyone<br/>will be wearing? That's exciting!")
('Risette', 'Hmm! I suppose this is one of the benefits of getting<br/>to work behind the scenes for a man like Mr. Gotti.')
('System', 'Several minutes later...')
('Director Gotti', "Behold, the clothing for the regular cast members in<br/>tomorrow's parade!")
('Director Gotti', 'I personally supervised every little detail just as I do<br/>my own films, from the type of fabric used to the<br/>lengths of every last cut.')
('Feri', 'Whoa, you did amazing, Mr. Gotti! It all looks<br/>so beautiful!')
('Aaron', "Dude certainly doesn't disappoint. I could get used to<br/>a view like this.")
('Risette', 'Indeed, I am impressed. The craftsmanship is bold<br/>and glamorous.')
('Agnès', "It's all amazing for sure, even if the outfits are<br/>definitely a little...showy.")
('Cervi', "*sigh* I'll have to take everyone's word for it.<br/>They told me to take my glasses off in the<br/>dressing room.")
('Cervi', 'I wish I could really see how I look. It is definitely a<br/>little breezy in parts, though...')
('Officer Vernier', "I'm fighting the urge to become a tomato, wearing<br/>something like this at my age.")
('Officer Vernier', "And yet it's all definitely starting to feel real now.<br/>I can't wait to get this parade on the road!")
('Juliana', 'Haha! Meanwhile, this is my kind of dress!')
('Juliana', "I'll have to make sure my dancing lives up to<br/>its sexiness. Can't leave anyone disappointed after<br/>seeing me looking like this!")
('Van', 'This definitely has your fingerprints all over it, Gotti.<br/>You always know how to bring the best out of<br/>a woman.')
('Director Gotti', "Gahaha! I can't take all the credit. If they look fine,<br/>it's because you and your crew know how to pick<br/>'em, spriggan.")
('Director Gotti', "You and I really do think a lot alike. You'll definitely<br/>have my business again in the future, that's for<br/>damn sure!")
('Director Gotti', "Sadly, I guess this means I have to retract my offer to<br/>your concierge there. I'm sorry to say, but a deal's<br/>a deal. I'll let you go.")
('Risette', 'Think nothing of it. Personally, I think these women<br/>make for far more appealing additions to your parade<br/>than I could ever be.')
('Director Gotti', "Come now! I stand by everything I said before.<br/>I'd still be more than happy to have you aboard some<br/>other time.")
('Director Gotti', "Anyway, time to get these girls prepped so they can<br/>make a big, sexy splash tomorrow when the<br/>spotlight's on them!")
('Director Gotti', "Thanks again, folks! I'll send your payment<br/>over, pronto.")
('System', 'Quest Extra, Extra! completed!')
('System', 'Received')
('System', 'Earned')
('Bermotti', "That was fast! I didn't expect to see you darlings<br/>so soon.")
('Van', "And I didn't expect to see a post from you.")
('Van', "Why go through the trouble? You coulda rung me<br/>up directly. You know I wouldn't mind.")
('Van', "Huh? Whaddaya mean, 'so soon'?")
('Bermotti', "Oh, you just happened to walk in to say hello, then?<br/>That's just as good.")
('Bermotti', "You see, I still don't have all the ingredients I need to<br/>make my drink for the bartending<br/>tournament tonight.")
('Bermotti', 'I put up a post to see if you all could be dolls and save<br/>me some trouble in lining them up.')
('Van', "Ah, got'cha. C'mon, a post? You coulda rung me<br/>up directly. You know I wouldn't mind.")
('Bermotti', 'Haha, I knew you were going to say that.')
('Bermotti', "But it's important to do these things the right way.<br/>I want to ask your help as a proper job, not just as a<br/>favor to a friend.")
('Bermotti', 'Even if I do feel a little bad dragging you sweethearts<br/>out here over something like this.')
('Van', "Don't sweat it. Sounds like a real bind to be in on the<br/>day of your tournament.")
('Risette', 'May I ask what sort of cocktail you intend to make?')
('Bermotti', "Of course! It'd be hard for you all to do your<br/>job otherwise.")
('Bermotti', 'Essentially, the main task of the tournament has been<br/>announced, so contestants can plan ahead.')
('Bermotti', "The judges want us to come up with our version of a<br/>Tharbad Night. No prize for guessing what it's<br/>named after.")
('Aaron', "Hell, it's a prize all its own. I ordered that shit at<br/>the nightclub, and it was great. Not too sweet, just the<br/>way I like it.")
('Feri', 'Wait, you mean the other night?')
('Agnès', 'Yes, Feri. When the boys decided to have a nice, fun<br/>night out on the town. Without us. By themselves.')
('Van', "D-Don't mind them. You were sayin'?")
('Bermotti', 'Haha! Ah, you silly poms. Anyway, normally, a<br/>Tharbad Night is blue. Reminds you of the desert sky<br/>at night, you see.')
('Bermotti', 'You even sprinkle in some gold leaf cut into the shape<br/>of stars for good measure.')
('Feri', "I can see why they'd make a drink like that! The stars<br/>out in the desert are so pretty at night!")
('Risette', 'Indeed. Without the light pollution from urban areas,<br/>clear night skies can be breathtaking.')
('Bermotti', "Exactly. It's a beautiful drink. You can see why they<br/>want us putting our own spin on it.")
('Bermotti', "For my part, I'm going to give it a little intrigue, you<br/>might say.")
('Bermotti', "I'm going for the life of an information broker, and<br/>the sweet, calm nights spent reveling in<br/>dangerous secrets. In drink form.")
('Bermotti', "And I'm going to do it by adding a red hue to it,<br/>turning it into a gradient.")
('Feri', 'Wow...it sounds so mature. Makes me wish I was<br/>older so I could try it.')
('Agnès', 'It does sound fascinating! And like something only<br/>you could make, Bermotti.')
('Bermotti', 'Oh, you two. Sweet as grenadine!')
('Bermotti', "On that note, for the redness, I plan to use the juice<br/>of a red cactus. They're hard to find, but the color is<br/>perfect for my needs.")
('Bermotti', "With that, I'm going to accent it with some black<br/>pomegranate on top.")
('Van', "And it's those two things you need us to fetch, right?")
('Bermotti', "Just so! Strictly speaking, it's by no means unheard of<br/>to find these things for sale in town.")
('Bermotti', "But like I said, red cactus itself isn't easy to get your<br/>hands on in the wild, so finding it at market can<br/>be dicey.")
('Bermotti', "And as for those pomegranates, I specifically want<br/>ones from a luxurious kind grown in Valis known as<br/>'nocturnal suns.'")
('Risette', 'I have heard of those. They get their name for their<br/>shining black luster that makes them stand out even<br/>in the dark of night, supposedly.')
('Bermotti', "They certainly do! I'd have been more shocked if you,<br/>of all people, hadn't heard of it.")
('Bermotti', "Those fruits also only show up once in a blue moon,<br/>and if they're going to be anywhere, it'll be the bazaar<br/>in the Cultural District.")
('Bermotti', "Unfortunately, my pickiness has come back to bite<br/>me, and I'm nearly out of time.")
('Bermotti', "You would think I'd know better, but alas, here I am.<br/>I've dug my own grave and now here lies Bermotti!<br/>Rest in peace...")
('Aaron', 'Hey, nothing wrong with wanting to put your best<br/>foot forward to win.')
('Aaron', "Can't see this crazy attention to detail not paying off<br/>when the time comes.")
('Risette', 'Even so, that does not change the fact that we have<br/>little time to spare if we are to track down<br/>these ingredients.')
('Van', "Yeah, 'specially since we're runnin' on a<br/>tight schedule. Gotta make a decision.")
('Bermotti', "I know just what kind of cocktail I want to whip up<br/>for my tournament tonight, but I'm up a creek<br/>without those ingredients.")
('Bermotti', 'Would you and your group have time to hunt them<br/>down for me, Van?')
('Van', 'I really wanna help you, I promise, but we got some<br/>other errands to run first.')
('Van', "You mind if we come talk to you again once we've got<br/>that sorted?")
('Bermotti', 'Sure, I understand. Do what you have to do.')
('Bermotti', "In the meantime, I'll keep thinking about whether<br/>there's anything else I can do, in case I need to<br/>change plans.")
('Van', "All right—we're in. You did a hell of a job analyzing<br/>that drug earlier. Least we can do is help with this.")
('Bermotti', "Oh, hush. That wasn't such a big deal.")
('Bermotti', 'But thanks, hon. I really appreciate it.')
('Aaron', "Let's not get ahead of ourselves here. Right now we<br/>got squat. Where are we supposed to start lookin' for<br/>these things, anyway?")
('Bermotti', 'Luckily for you, a merchant in town offered me<br/>some clues.')
('Bermotti', 'For one thing, apparently red cactus only grows in a<br/>particular part of the Sandsea.')
('Bermotti', 'A nasty part where the sandstorm tends to be brutal,<br/>no less, making it hard for anyone to step foot in it.')
('Bermotti', "The way he made it sound, it's always a challenge, at<br/>best, to harvest.")
('Risette', 'If that is the case, it would be nice if we could<br/>somehow obtain that juice without having to venture<br/>out into the desert.')
('Agnès', 'I think it would still be worth the trip, to be honest.')
('Agnès', "It's risky, but it also seems like our best shot<br/>at success.")
('Feri', "Yeah, and we were out there yesterday. We know our<br/>way around. It'll be fine!")
('Risette', 'Very well, then. The desert it is.')
('Van', "So, to sum up, we'll find the red cactus in the desert<br/>and the pomegranates lurkin' in the bazaar, if Lady<br/>Luck's on our side.")
('Van', "We can start with either one, whichever's easiest to<br/>get to as we make our rounds across town.")
('Bermotti', "Thanks again, darlings. Don't feel like you have to go<br/>berserk just for little old me, though. If it's too much,<br/>I'll live.")
('System', 'Quest Cocktail Crafting started!')
('Philica', "Yeah, that's right, I'm the one who bought the<br/>nocturnal suns off Monir.")
('Philica', "I'm planning to make a limited time flavor for my ice<br/>cream and make a killing selling it to rich people with<br/>equally rich appetites.")
('Van', "Sounds like you're a born merchant. I can respect<br/>the hustle.")
('Philica', "Events like the film festival are when I make the<br/>real money. I'd be stupid not to have something lined<br/>up for the occasion.")
('Philica', 'Anyway, what brings you guys here? You on the<br/>pomegranate hunt, too?')
('System', 'Van explained what was going on with the bartending<br/>tournament and why they needed the fruit.')
('Philica', '...Sure. That makes sense.')
('Philica', "But I've got to make a living, too, you know. I can't<br/>go around giving away ingredients like these for free.")
('Philica', "But if you were to sweeten the deal and make it worth<br/>my while, I'd be willing to consider giving you some.")
('Agnès', 'What sweetening of the deal did you have in mind?')
('Van', "Don't worry. We're not tryin' to be freeloaders.")
('Van', "Tell you what: what if you go ahead and make some<br/>of this new flavor of yours, and we'll give you an<br/>honest review of it?")
('Philica', 'A taste test, huh? Hmm...')
('Risette', 'I assure you, the insight we can offer would be quite<br/>valuable to you.')
('Risette', 'Mr. Arkride especially has a very refined palate<br/>for sweets. In fact, he is something of a celebrity for it<br/>in such circles.')
('Feri', "W-Wow. I didn't know he was that famous for it.")
('Aaron', "(He's not! It's called upselling! Now zip it!)")
('Philica', '...All right. Deal, then.')
('Philica', "I was thinking I needed some opinions, anyway. I can<br/>tell this ice cream is still missing a certain something,<br/>but I'm not sure what.")
('Philica', "But I'll only offer the pomegranates if your reviews<br/>really impress me. How about three of you step up<br/>and tell me what you think?")
('Van', "Sounds good to me. Let's do this.")
('Feri', "Van's gotta be one of the reviewers, obviously.")
('Aaron', "You only offered to tell her what you think because<br/>you want to taste that ice cream for<br/>yourself, don'tcha? Be honest.")
('Van', "Shut up! No, I don't, punk.")
('Aaron', 'Whatever you say, chief. How about we have the kids<br/>be the other two reviewers?')
('Feri', 'Really? Are you sure?')
('Agnès', "That sounds like a really big responsibility. I don't<br/>know if I can give a useful review off the cuff<br/>like that...")
('Risette', "That is not a problem—you don't need to take it<br/>that seriously. Simply giving her an honest opinion<br/>will be helpful, I'm sure.")
('Philica', "If you're ready, I'll have that ice cream right up for<br/>you folks. Give me just a few minutes.")
('System', 'Several minutes later...')
('System', 'Van, Agnès, and Feri received their ice cream and<br/>gave it a taste test.')
('Feri', "Mmm! It's so sweet, yet kinda sour! I love it!")
('Agnès', 'It has a really good balance between sweetness<br/>and sourness.')
('Agnès', 'I could see this being a really great flavor to have<br/>during the summer. Other than that, uh...')
('Agnès', 'Err... Well...')
('Van', 'The girls basically got it in one.')
('Van', "This has an incredibly refreshing taste that goes<br/>perfectly with Tharbad's hot climate. I could have it<br/>over and over again, easy.")
('Philica', "Heehee, yeah? That's great. That's exactly what I was<br/>gunning for when coming up with the recipe.")
('Van', "Here's a question for you: are you usin' pure fruit juice<br/>for this ice cream?")
('Philica', "Yeah, that's right. Why do you ask?")
('Van', "So, I think you got the sweetness right, but it could be<br/>takin' better advantage of the sharp sourness from<br/>the pomegranate.")
('Van', "Have you thought about addin' some pulp to<br/>your mix? It'd probably help change up the<br/>texture, too.")
('Philica', "I did try that, and you're not wrong, it did add a<br/>nice accent.")
('Philica', "The problem is, even when I do that, it's still not<br/>punchy enough.")
('Van', 'What about the seeds, then?')
('Philica', "I've never heard of mixing seeds into ice cream.<br/>Won't they be too hard AND make it taste tart?")
('Van', 'Nah, think about it. The thing about black<br/>pomegranates is, they like hot, dry weather.')
('Van', 'The fruit itself is big, while the skin is shallow and<br/>the seeds are small and soft.')
('Van', "Somethin' like a nocturnal sun, you can eat the seeds<br/>whole, no problem.")
('Van', "They're actually not tart at all. Quite the opposite—<br/>they smell nice and nutty.")
('Van', "You get that in there, I think you'll achieve an accent<br/>that offers the full pomegranate experience.")
('Philica', '...')
('Philica', "Interesting. I hadn't given it so much consideration...")
('Philica', 'All right, you win.')
('Philica', 'Thanks for such detailed advice. Would three<br/>pomegranates be enough for you?')
('Agnès', "More than enough! Are you sure you don't mind?")
('Philica', 'Nah, a promise is a promise. How could I deny you<br/>guys anything after getting schooled so thoroughly?')
('Feri', 'Yes! We did it, Agnès!')
('Agnès', 'Ahaha... I think Van gets most of the credit for this<br/>one, Feri.')
('Philica', "No, no, those from-the-hip reactions helped a lot,<br/>too, girls. I'm glad you enjoyed the ice cream.<br/>That's what counts!")
('Philica', "Now I can make the perfect ice cream that'll really<br/>bring in those high-flying customers.")
('Risette', 'I wish you luck with your new ice cream. I am sure it<br/>will be a great success.')
('Philica', 'Aww, thank you.')
('Philica', "Tell your bartender friend I hope those pomegranates<br/>help him make something special, too. I'll be rooting<br/>for him!")
('Van', "Will do. You're doing him a real solid. We appreciate<br/>it, and we'll get out of the way now.")
('System', 'Obtained the three black pomegranates.')
('Agnès', "Wonderful, we've got both of the ingredients.<br/>We should be good to go, right?")
('Van', "Yep. Let's drop these off with Bermotti so he can do<br/>his thing.")
('Agnès', "Now all that's left to find is that red cactus, right?")
('Van', 'Yep. Next stop, the Sandsea.')
('Bermotti', "You're back! How did you sweethearts do?")
('Aaron', "We did great. Everything you want is right here.<br/>You'd better be grateful, man.")
('Feri', "Arusha's wings, you don't have to be such a jerk about<br/>it, Aaron!")
('Aaron', 'Look, I just want a little appreciation for having to<br/>haul this shit all the way back, okay?')
('Van', 'Yeah, yeah, thanks for being our pack mule, sport.<br/>Now give the man his ingredients.')
('System', 'Aaron handed over the red cactus and black<br/>pomegranates to Bermotti.')
('Bermotti', 'Wow! You darlings really did get them for me!')
('Risette', 'Please feel free to inspect everything to make sure it is<br/>all in order.')
('Bermotti', "Oh, it's fine. You all did great! These are perfect!<br/>I couldn't be happier!")
('Bermotti', "Thank you all so much. You must be exhausted after<br/>that running around. Look, you're still half-buried<br/>in sand!")
('Agnès', "Heehee, that's okay. We're just glad to hear we<br/>did well.")
('Bermotti', "That you have! Now that you've done your part, it's<br/>my turn to deliver some results so all the blood, sweat,<br/>and tears weren't in vain.")
('Bermotti', "And I'll start with a little test run and mix the drink I<br/>plan to enter, right here. Would you be kind enough<br/>to taste it for me?")
('Aaron', "Hell yeah! I'll taste as many free drinks as you wanna<br/>throw at me.")
('Aaron', 'Sucks to be you, small fry.')
('Feri', "Grr. So what if you're old enough to drink? You don't<br/>have to rub it in!")
('Van', "For a couple of people who just went walkin' in<br/>blazing-ass heat, you sure don't sound worse for<br/>wear, somehow. What a miracle.")
('Bermotti', 'And here we are.')
('Bermotti', 'I call it a Charme de la Nuit.')
('Bermotti', "As I said, it's intended to invoke a quiet, sweet night.<br/>The kind you might spend, say, trading in dark,<br/>dangerous secrets.")
('Van', "Damn. That gradient you've pulled off looks killer.")
('Risette', 'The nocturnal sun adorned on top is also a very<br/>pleasing touch.')
('Agnès', 'It looks perfect. It came out just like you said<br/>it would!')
('Bermotti', "We don't know that for sure, yet. Van, hon, I'll let<br/>you have the honor of being the first to taste it.<br/>Please, go on. You've earned it. ❤")
('Van', "Can't say I'm much for day drinkin', but I suppose<br/>this counts as part of the job. Well, bottoms up...")
('Van', 'That...is good. Real good.')
('Van', "Crisp sweetness, comforting sourness...it's<br/>sublime, Bermotti.")
('Van', 'You can taste the black pomegranate, too, and the<br/>grainy texture it adds is a fun touch.')
('Bermotti', "Sounds like I have a winner, then. That's a relief.")
('Bermotti', "But it only turned out so well because of everyone's<br/>hard work today. Thank you all again.")
('Bermotti', 'I can now enter the tournament tonight at my<br/>absolute best.')
('Van', "Damn right, you can. I absolutely mean it when I say<br/>that with skills like yours, you're gonna knock<br/>'em dead.")
('Bermotti', "Fingers crossed! I don't intend to pull any punches,<br/>that's for sure. I'm in it to win.")
('Aaron', "Okay, great, the old man's had his turn. Now when<br/>am I gonna get in on the action, huh?")
('Feri', '...I wish I could have some. *sigh*')
('Bermotti', "Aww, no need to be sad! I'm making some<br/>for everyone!")
('Bermotti', 'Of course, the ones for the minors here will be a little<br/>less twisty.')
('Feri', "Yay! That's more like it! Thank you, Bermotti!")
('Agnès', "I'm glad you won't have to miss out after all, Feri.")
('Van', 'What about you, Risette? Want a sip?')
('Risette', '...I suppose I can accept a drink, given the occasion.')
('Risette', "Although I would ask that mine be nonalcoholic as<br/>well, seeing as I'm on active duty.")
('System', "Van and the rest took a short break to enjoy<br/>Bermotti's specially prepared drinks.")
('System', 'Soon enough, however, they got back to work.')
('System', 'Quest Cocktail Crafting completed!')
('System', 'Received')
('System', "Van's pickup truck is parked here.")
('Van', "Ugh. When I get back, I'm gonna have to give you a<br/>full wash, top to bottom.")
('Feri', 'Why? It still looks good as new to me.')
('Agnès', 'Well, it IS covered in sand.')
('Aaron', "Aww. Poor guy. Can't stand to see his baby looking<br/>nothing less than her finest. She'll survive, old man.")
('System', 'Ride the elevator?')
('System', 'Ride the elevator?')
