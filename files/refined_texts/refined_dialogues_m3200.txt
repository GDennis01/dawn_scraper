('Dingo', "I'll do my best to get in touch with both the police<br/>and guild to make arrangements with them.")
('Dingo', "But time's not on our side, so we can't just sit around.<br/>Whatever you do, keep Marielle and the kid safe!")
('Dingo', "The police and guild are rushing over as fast as they<br/>can, but it's going to take time for them to get here.")
('Dingo', 'I hate to say this, but you guys will have to go on<br/>ahead and confront those thugs by yourselves.<br/>Good luck!')
('Van', 'Those goons should be just up ahead.')
('Van', "Last thing we need is to get spotted and have more<br/>people taken hostage. Better to follow 'em on foot the<br/>rest of the way.")
('Van', "We'll hit you up once we find 'em, Dingo. In the<br/>meantime, try to contact as many people as you can.")
('Agnès', 'Yes, please! Especially the police and guild! We could<br/>really use the help!')
('Dingo', "Right. I'll see if I can get them to come over and<br/>provide backup once things are under control in<br/>the city.")
('Dingo', '...Take good care of Marielle and the kid in there.')
('Feri', 'You got it!')
('Aaron', "Well, what're we waiting for? Let's get to work.<br/>The sooner we find the girls, the sooner we can get<br/>them out!")
('Risette', 'Indeed. Time to start tracking the perpetrators.')
('Van', 'For a pretty normal car, those guys sure managed to<br/>get it way out into the dunes. Sheesh.')
('Van', 'Normally, this is about as far as you could go in one.<br/>The terrain past here is too rough.')
('Feri', "For sure. That's exactly what happened the last time I<br/>was here—we couldn't use our vehicles for very long<br/>at all.")
('Agnès', "And it's not even really a 'normal' car, it's a limousine.<br/>You'd think that would do even worse in this kind<br/>of environment...")
('Risette', 'On a separate note, I can confirm that the both of<br/>them are travelers from Oración to the northeast.')
('Risette', 'One of them was born into wealth, while the other<br/>appears to have made their fortune through a new<br/>business venture.')
('Risette', 'Nobody seems to have direct links to A, including the<br/>two bodyguards hired to escort them.')
('Aaron', 'Huh? How the hell do you know all—')
('Risette', 'Last night, when we encountered them at the hotel, I<br/>ran a check on their identities via the orbal network.')
('Risette', 'Rest assured, my inquiry was within legal limits and<br/>undertaken purely as a part of my work in risk<br/>management data collection.')
('Agnès', "Umm... That's good to hear, I guess.")
('Aaron', "Damn. That's a lot of power for a random-ass maid<br/>to have.")
('Van', "Good thing she's on our side. I'd hate to have a lady<br/>as capable as her as an enemy.")
('Risette', "You're too kind, Mr. Arkride.")
('Feri', "But wait—if these guys are just tourists, it seems<br/>weird to me that they'd just go hanging out in<br/>the desert.")
('Agnès', 'I think so, too. It makes you wonder what they could<br/>possibly be after.')
('Van', '...Stay focused. There are still more tracks to follow.<br/>Be careful and keep your eyes peeled.')
('Aaron', 'Jackpot. I see footprints for four men and two ladies.')
('Feri', "They must've just been here. If we rush in right now,<br/>we could still catch them!")
('Dingo', 'Good to know. It sounds like the guild and the cops<br/>have gotten things back under control in the city, too.')
('Dingo', "They're on their way, but I wouldn't expect them to<br/>get there anytime soon.")
('Agnès', "But we don't have any time to wait...")
('Van', "Yep. Dingo, keep in touch with the others.<br/>We're going on ahead.")
('Dingo', "Got'cha. Be careful out there. I'm counting on you.")
('Agnès', 'Huh?!')
('Feri', 'Wah!')
('Risette', 'That happened last night as well.')
('Feri', 'Yeah, and when we went inside the underground<br/>waterway back in the city.')
('Aaron', 'That can only mean one thing, then.')
('Van', "Right. This might just give us the chance we've been<br/>looking for.")
('Agnès', 'Obviously, rescuing Shaheena and Marielle<br/>comes first. No questions asked.')
('Agnès', "But we should make sure we're prepared for anything,<br/>just in case!")
('Risette', "Yes, I think that's an apt assessment.")
('Van', 'There they are!')
('Feri', 'Shaheena! Marielle!')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "It's you guys!")
('Shaheena', 'You came! You really came...!')
('Van', 'We sure did. Sorry to keep you two waiting.')
('Agnès', "I'm so glad you're both okay. Hold on just a minute,<br/>we're going to—")
('Aaron', 'Hold up! What the hell is that thing?!')
(61361, "Huh...? What're you guys doing here?")
(61361, 'Decided to come join the party, have you?')
(61360, "Fine with me! Come on over and let's have some<br/>fun, man!")
('Van', "Something's definitely wrong with these bozos.")
('Feri', "I'm picking up this weird aura, like they're being<br/>infested by something!")
('Aaron', "What the hell? They sure don't look like zombie<br/>puppets to me!")
('Risette', '...Incoming attack. Beware.')
(61360, 'RAAAAAAAAAHH!')
('Feri', 'Whew...')
('Aaron', 'Weird vibes or not, in the end, they were<br/>still pushovers.')
('Shaheena', 'Wow, that was amazing! You guys are awesome!')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "*sniffle* We're saved! Finally, I can get out of these<br/>sandy—")
('Van', 'Up above!')
('Agnès', 'I knew it!')
('Aaron', 'They were lying in wait!')
('Van', "This ain't a show, so quit spectatin' and come out<br/>where we can see you. Now!")
('Olympia', 'I see. So you were prepared for me to ambush you.')
('Feri', "Are you one of Almata's minions? Or some kind of<br/>assassin of theirs?")
('Olympia', "No. I've simply formed a contract with them—no<br/>more and no less.")
('Olympia', "Moreover, our mission—mine and Ishtanti's—is<br/>over now.")
('Van', 'Ishtanti... Is that what you call your angel friend?')
('Risette', "Whatever it is, it certainly doesn't look like it was<br/>produced with contemporary technology.")
('Risette', "Those slash marks—they distinctly resemble ones I've<br/>seen within Marduk's records.")
('Risette', 'Specifically, those from the investigation into the<br/>Eisenschild squad that was eradicated two<br/>months ago.')
('Agnès', '...!')
('Feri', 'Are you from the same old group as that<br/>Almata guy? Did you help him attack Aida and<br/>her corps?!')
('Olympia', 'I did. That was part of my contract.')
('Olympia', 'The Eisenschild commander put up a harder fight<br/>than I anticipated. She has my respect.')
('Feri', 'Gah... Raaaaaah!')
('Risette', '...Ms. Al-Fayed.')
('Feri', '*pant* *pant*')
('Olympia', 'This concludes the on-site testing.')
('Olympia', 'I have no orders to engage in combat.<br/>Therefore, Ishtanti and I will be departing.')
('Aaron', "Hey, isn't that—")
('Van', "It sure is. You know, miss, I've noticed something<br/>off about you since our run-in at the waterway.")
('Van', "It's like there's no warmth in your eyes. You view<br/>others, even yourself, as nothing but 'things.'<br/>Thought so at the club last night, too.")
('Olympia', "...You have an astute eye. Or, I suppose nose, in your<br/>case, due to how you pick up 'scents.'")
('Olympia', 'Regardless, do not let those senses of yours go<br/>to waste. Farewell.')
('Aaron', "Tch. What a piece of work. Acting like she's above<br/>it all...")
('Feri', "Ugh... I've still got a long ways to go...")
('Agnès', 'Oh, Feri...')
('Van', "I was hopin' we could nab that Genesis if she left an<br/>opening, but I guess she's not gonna make it<br/>that easy.")
('Agnès', "It's fine, really. I'm just glad nobody's hurt.")
('Agnès', 'Shaheena, are you okay?')
('Shaheena', "My arm's a little tingly, but that's all. Thank you so<br/>much, Agnès!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'What she said, times a million... Oooh, if only I had<br/>my camera with me!')
('Aaron', 'Putting aside these bozos for a moment, just what the<br/>hell is that giant plant?')
('Van', "My guess is a kind of succulent. From the way it's<br/>glowin', it could even be—")
('Prince Sherid', '...And you have it. Alas that we appear to have<br/>missed the excitement.')
('Feri', '...Oh!')
('Agnès', "You're...")
('Shaheena', "You're the one who scouted out my sister.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Prince Sherid?!')
('Van', "Guessin' you were on the same trail we were?")
('Prince Sherid', 'In some fashion. As it so happens, our country and<br/>Calvard have had warm relations for a long time now.')
('Prince Sherid', "We've been actively involved in the technology,<br/>investing, and, as you've seen, the movie production<br/>sectors recently as well.")
('Prince Sherid', "To that end, we have kept our eyes on certain kinds<br/>of activity, and... Well, Naje? Is that plant what we're<br/>looking for?")
('Naje', 'Yes, Your Highness. It appears to be a type of agave<br/>plant containing alkaloids.')
('Naje', "Most likely, it's been energized via reaction with the<br/>septium veins.")
('Agnès', 'Alkaloids? Those can only be extracted from certain<br/>types of plants, right?')
('Risette', 'Correct. They serve as an ingredient in things such<br/>as anesthetics.')
('Risette', 'However, depending on the amount, application, and<br/>plant type, they can also act as stimulants or<br/>produce hallucinations.')
('Feri', '...!')
('Aaron', 'So our guess was right on the mark.')
('Van', "Yeah. This thing's being used to make drugs.")
('Van', "It's clear as day that this all ties into what happened<br/>in Messeldam.")
('Shaheena', "That's crazy! How could we have that in Tharbad...?")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Holy... This is an enormous scoop!')
('Prince Sherid', "I'm impressed you caught up to us so quickly. We had<br/>been investigating for a month.")
('Prince Sherid', 'It seems I was right to come down here and enter the<br/>fray myself.')
('Feri', '...?!')
('Aaron', 'Oho.')
('Van', "So...we're both after the same thing.")
('Van', "But I get the feeling you're not here to team up with<br/>us, are you?")
('Agnès', 'What?')
('Prince Sherid', "Haha. It's a shame, really. Everything else aside, on a<br/>personal level, I feel like you and I could get along<br/>quite well.")
('Prince Sherid', "Unfortunately, among other matters, I'm not on the<br/>best of terms with the employer of that maid of yours.")
('Risette', "...I'm sorry to hear that.")
('Prince Sherid', "But even more than that, the number one thing I<br/>can't bring myself to trust is you, Van Arkride.")
('Prince Sherid', 'Not only are you an external tester for Marduk, you<br/>have unique ties to both the seemly and unseemly<br/>parts of society.')
('Prince Sherid', "In fact, depending on the situation, I suspect those<br/>ties could run even as far as the likes of 'them.'")
('Feri', "Wh-What?! You can't be serious!")
('Aaron', 'Now hold on. You accusing our boss of working<br/>with Almata?')
('Van', "I'll put it like this: as long as they respect my rules,<br/>I'm not, in principle, above workin' for any<br/>particular client.")
('Agnès', "But in practice, he would NEVER work for them.<br/>They've crossed far too many lines at this point.")
('Agnès', "I'm confident if they ever came to him asking for his<br/>help, he would refuse.")
('Van', '...')
('Feri', 'Agnès...')
('Prince Sherid', 'You have some loyal assistants, I see. But that does<br/>little to assuage my concerns.')
('Feri', "She's got a gun shamshir!")
('Aaron', "Heh! Now we're talking! I hardly broke a sweat with<br/>those losers earlier.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Wh-What the...?!')
('Shaheena', "Can someone explain what's going on here?!")
('Risette', "It seems we're left with no choice.")
('Van', "Nope. I take it you're throwing your hat in<br/>the ring, too, Your Highness?")
('Prince Sherid', "Why not? It's all in good fun. Though Naje here is<br/>more than capable on her own.")
('Prince Sherid', 'Either way, words alone simply are not enough for<br/>me to surmise the strength and character of you and<br/>the rest of your team.')
('Prince Sherid', 'And so I, Sherid Asval...')
('Prince Sherid', '...shall personally evaluate Arkride Solutions!')
('Naje', 'And I, Naje Berka, stand with him!')
('Naje', "They're formidable.")
('Prince Sherid', "I'm impressed they held out this long.")
('Prince Sherid', "I think we've evaluated them enough.")
('Naje', 'Shall I end it, then?')
('Prince Sherid', 'Go easy on the lackeys. Otherwise? By all means.')
('Aaron', 'Oh, screw you!')
('Van', "Well, all right, then—guess we're doin' this!")
(40306, "Don't even think about it.")
('Naje', '...!')
('Van', 'What?!')
('Feri', "It's Sylphid...")
('Prince Sherid', "Well, would you look at that? I didn't think you'd get<br/>here so soon, Fie.")
('Fie', "Well, I have. That's enough, Your Highness.")
('Fie', "Playtime's over. Now that I'm here, we need to let the<br/>victims rest.")
('Dingo', 'Marielle, are you all right?!')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Dingo!')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "*sniffle* Where have you been? I've been trying to get<br/>a hold of you all this time!")
('Dingo', '...Heh. Guess I had nothing to worry about.')
('Bracer Renton', 'These must be the perpetrators.')
('Bracer Ismail', 'This saves us a lot of trouble. You okay if we bring<br/>them in?')
('Agnès', 'Oh, you must be the bracer from Erebonia.')
('Agnès', "Did you respond to Dingo's call for help?")
('Fie', 'Yep. Luckily, I just got into town a little while ago.')
('Fie', "Seems like I might've gotten here a bit late, though.")
('Van', "Nah, don't sweat it. Your timing was perfect.")
('Prince Sherid', "So you say. But I would've liked to see those depths<br/>of yours a little more, as it were.")
('Prince Sherid', 'Especially when it comes to those mysterious objects<br/>and that...curious figure you like to adopt.')
('Agnès', '...')
('Van', 'So you were interested in all that, too, were you?')
('Fie', "I can understand how that looks suspicious, but trust<br/>me, he's more than legit enough to make up for it.")
('Fie', 'Anyway, the police should be here any minute.<br/>Do you mind if we take it from here?')
('Prince Sherid', "Not at all. In fact, that's what I expected. Also, Naje,<br/>if you would.")
('Naje', 'Yes, Your Highness.')
('Naje', 'Allow me to offer you both this water.')
('Shaheena', 'Hrm...')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', '*sigh* This has all been so much.')
('Van', 'Does all this mean I pass your test, then?')
('Prince Sherid', "That you do, abrupt ending aside. I'm satisfied with<br/>your strength.")
('Prince Sherid', 'Please feel free to continue working on my request, as<br/>circumstances permit.')
('Prince Sherid', 'As for that plant, I would like to claim half of it.<br/>The guild can retain the remainder.')
('Aaron', 'Oh, right. I forgot all about that big guy.')
('Risette', "If you don't mind, I'd also like to retrieve a sample<br/>of it.")
('Prince Sherid', 'With that, Van Arkride...show me just what you<br/>can do.')
('Prince Sherid', 'What truths you, in all of your unknowable depths,<br/>can uncover...')
('Prince Sherid', '...in this city of gold, as their invisible yet heavy hand<br/>looms over it.')
('System', 'From there, Prince Sherid and Naje promptly<br/>returned to town via his personal airship.')
('System', 'Likewise, Van and the others also made their way<br/>back to Tharbad, entrusting the kidnappers to the<br/>bracers on site.')
('Van', "Looks like we've found some cargo. Doesn't seem to<br/>have been dropped that long ago.")
('Agnès', 'Maybe it fell off when the caravan got attacked by<br/>those monsters.')
('Aaron', "I don't see any camels anywhere. Think those<br/>monsters gobbled our objective up?")
('Feri', "Urgh, Aaron! Don't say things like that! That<br/>poor camel...")
('Aaron', "I'm kidding, small fry. Chill out.")
('Van', "Let's assume it's still with us. We need to figure out<br/>what direction it went once it got separated from<br/>the caravan.")
('Van', "Given the climate and heat, my bet's that it either<br/>took off for a watering hole or went to find<br/>some shade.")
('Agnès', "But according to the map, there's nowhere to drink<br/>water around here.")
('Feri', "Actually, camels don't necessarily need an oasis or<br/>anything to stay hydrated.")
('Feri', "They can break off cacti and suck up the water<br/>that's inside!")
('Feri', 'Even the Kruga do that all the time, when they have<br/>to work in real wastelands and stuff.')
('Van', "Nice. I think you're on to something, Feri.")
('Van', 'Any camel worth its salt in the desert is bound to<br/>know other ways to find water.')
('Agnès', "That's interesting! I wouldn't have considered cacti.")
('Aaron', 'What do you know, I actually learned something new<br/>from our pipsqueak today.')
('Feri', "Heehee! Stop it, you guys, you're gonna make<br/>me blush!")
('Feri', "But unfortunately, I don't see any cacti that've been<br/>nibbled on recently, looking around.")
('Agnès', 'Well, what if it went somewhere to try and get out of<br/>the sandstorm first?')
('Agnès', 'I could see someone taking shelter and staying<br/>hydrated using the cacti there.')
('Aaron', "Then how's about we try heading in...say,<br/>that direction?")
('Aaron', 'Looks pretty rocky. Probably makes for decent<br/>protection against the winds around here.')
('Van', "Yeah, I'd say it's worth checking it out. Let's see what<br/>we can find over there.")
('Aaron', "Hey, look what's under attack!")
('Van', 'Ah, hell, that must be our camel! Better step in before<br/>things go south.')
('Agnès', "Ugh... My feet feel like boulders at this point.<br/>But now isn't the time to complain!")
('Feri', "That's right! We've got a camel to save!")
('Van', 'Phew. That had me worried for a moment.')
('Agnès', "I know. I'm just glad we were able to find the camel<br/>in one piece.")
('Feri', "Judging by those cactus chunks, my hunch was right.<br/>He must've been thirsty and came over for a drink.")
('Feri', "I bet he's pretty tired from hauling all that cargo<br/>around for so long. Poor guy.")
('Aaron', 'What about the goods? Is that raw cacao stuff<br/>still intact?')
('Aaron', "Not that I care THAT much. It'd just suck to come<br/>this far and have nothing to show for it.")
('Van', "Let's find out. Hold on a sec...")
('Van', '...')
('Aaron', "Well, how's it look? Is our work paying off, or what?")
('Feri', "Oooh... I'm so anxious. Van looks so tense, it's<br/>rubbing off on me now!")
('Agnès', 'V-Van?')
('System', 'From there, the party rounded up the camel and<br/>brought it back to the merchant in Tharbad.')
('Feri', 'There it is! Red cactus!')
('Aaron', 'Sweet. We should harvest a bunch of it and make a<br/>killing back in town.')
('Van', "Don't even think about it, pal.")
('Risette', "Let's limit ourselves to a small portion and be on<br/>our way.")
('System', 'Obtained Red Cactus.')
('Agnès', "Great. Now we've got both of the ingredients.<br/>We should be good to go, right?")
('Van', "Yep. Let's drop these off with Bermotti so he can do<br/>his thing with them.")
('Agnès', 'Now all we have left to find are some black<br/>pomegranate seeds, right?')
('Van', "Right. Let's talk to the ice cream seller in the<br/>Entertainment District and see if she's willing to part<br/>ways with some.")
('Agnès', 'Now all we have left to find are black<br/>pomegranate seeds.')
('Van', "Right. Let's check out the bazaar in the Cultural<br/>District and see if we can find a lead.")
('System', 'A fearsome foe is prowling around.')
('System', 'Found <br/>.')
('System', 'Quest Sandsea Extermination completed!')
('System', 'Received')
