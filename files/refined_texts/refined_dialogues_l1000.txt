('Feri', "Whoa! It's so fast!")
('Agnès', 'And it still manages to be such a smooth ride, too.')
('Agnès', "I think I can see a little of why you're so proud of<br/>it, Van.")
('Van', "I'd really start to cry if you couldn't.")
('Van', "We'll be outta the capital and on the northern<br/>highway in ten or so.")
('Van', "Then I'll show you how fast and smooth my baby can<br/>REALLY be.")
('Feri', 'It can go even faster?!')
('Agnès', 'J-Just try to keep it safe, please...')
('Aaron', "You sure know how to stay busy while on the<br/>job, don'tcha?")
('Aaron', 'We ran up, down, and all around the city—and we<br/>even headed to its outskirts.')
('Aaron', "Is this what every day's gonna be like?")
('Van', "Nah. We usually have more free time, but we'll have<br/>busy days like this every now and then.")
('Van', 'Why? You afraid of a little elbow grease?')
('Aaron', 'Pfft. As if.')
('Aaron', "I'm never opposed to getting my hands dirty as long<br/>as the work's not boring—and today's jobs definitely<br/>weren't that.")
('Van', "Good, 'cause there's plenty more where that<br/>came from.")
('Feri', 'Heehee.')
('Feri', 'Oh! I almost forgot. Do you mind if we drop by the<br/>roastery in the 9th District?')
('Feri', 'Paulette asked if I could get some coffee beans while<br/>we were out.')
('Van', 'Got it. We can make a quick stop.')
('Aaron', 'Damn it, small fry. Way to make this trip longer than<br/>it needs to be.')
('Aaron', '...Hmm?')
('Feri', "It's raining.")
('Van', 'And there goes the paint job.')
('Agnès', 'I never thought Aaron would be such a great driver.')
('Feri', "His smooth driving skills are off the charts!<br/>He's really giving Van a run for his money.")
('Aaron', 'See? Told you I kick ass behind the wheel.')
('Van', 'Ugh. Only thing I hate more than a smug little shit is<br/>a smug little shit with talent.')
('Aaron', "I'll admit, this isn't a bad ride. I can see why you're<br/>always raving about her.")
('Aaron', "She's smooth, customizable, and comfy. I can also<br/>make sharp turns without a hitch.")
('Aaron', "I've always been a Red Star kind of guy, but I'm<br/>coming around to Ingert.")
('Van', "Heh. I'll make a convert out of you yet. Of the four<br/>main brands, they're the best of the bun—")
('Aaron', "I think I'll take her for a spin from time to time. If I<br/>pretend she's mine, every girl in town will want a<br/>piece of me. ❤")
('Van', 'Burn. In. Hell.')
('Van', "Anyway, I'll let you stay on the wheel for a while.")
('Van', "If you and I keep takin' turns, we'll be at Tharbad<br/>by sunrise.")
('Van', 'Then we can meet up with Nina. Curious to find out<br/>what we signed up for.')
('Agnès', "Me, too. It must involve the Geneses somehow, but<br/>that's about all we know for sure.")
('Agnès', "It's times like these when I wish I could glean more<br/>insight from them when they're glowing...")
('Feri', "Hey, don't go beating yourself up.")
('Feri', "I've been wondering, though. How does the glowing<br/>thing even work?")
('Van', "Goddess only knows. Those things might not be<br/>indecipherable enigmas like artifacts, but we still<br/>know next to nothing about 'em.")
('Aaron', "Maybe there's a pattern for when they light up.")
('Aaron', "Don't they go off when Almata's pulling shit?<br/>Could they be in Tharbad?")
('Feri', '...!')
('Van', "I had my contacts look into that, but they haven't<br/>found a trace of 'em there.")
('Van', "Still, they could've been the ones who sent those<br/>threat letters out.")
('Feri', "Fingers crossed that isn't the case.")
('Aaron', "I'll bet it isn't. The approach is too soft and<br/>roundabout for them.")
('Agnès', "Not to mention, they don't have anything to gain by<br/>obstructing the festival.")
('Agnès', "At least, not the one in Tharbad. Maybe they had<br/>reason to stop the one in Messeldam since they're<br/>headquartered there.")
('Van', 'Nah. Last I heard, they moved outta Messeldam a<br/>long time ago.')
('Van', "The people responsible for stoppin' the last festival<br/>were a bunch of racial terrorists.")
('Van', 'They threatened it and started a fire. Whole thing<br/>was canceled as a precaution.')
('Feri', 'What? For real?')
('Aaron', "And here I thought those racist bastards were a<br/>dying breed. I'd love to wipe the floor with<br/>those shitstains.")
('Feri', "It's so spacious in here!")
('Aaron', "This here's an ETWS stretch limo, right? Hell of<br/>a luxury.")
('Aaron', "Ride's smooth as a baby's ass, too. Still room to move<br/>up in the world, huh?")
('Van', 'Hmph. The suspension systems in a luxury vehicle<br/>like this versus my pickup are built for totally<br/>different things.')
('Prince Sherid', 'Haha. Speaking of, I take it you liked the part I<br/>sent you?')
('Prince Sherid', "I got it on special order to ensure it didn't clash with<br/>the aesthetic of your truck.")
('Van', "Oh, 'like' undersells it. It's a thing of beauty.")
('Van', "Even if that ulterior motive behind sending it wasn't<br/>just in my head.")
('Agnès', "Hmm? ...Still, I'm glad you're both looking well.")
('Naje', 'Thank you. My apologies again for all the trouble we<br/>caused you.')
('Prince Sherid', "We weren't expecting to see you all again so<br/>soon, either.")
('Prince Sherid', 'But we were already here for a visit with the<br/>president, so the timing happened to line up.')
('Agnès', '...What?')
('Feri', 'Oh! That Gramheart guy!')
('Aaron', "Huh. Didn't see anything about a meeting on<br/>the news. Some kinda secret talks?")
('Kincaid', "You needn't concern yourself with details that are on<br/>a need-to-know basis.")
('Van', "...Well, we are livin' in crazy times. No doubt there's<br/>plenty for our leaders to be talkin' about.")
('Van', "Much as it bugs me that you've clearly got somethin'<br/>besides that you wanna dump on us.")
('Feri', 'Oh?')
('Risette', "I think I see what's going on now.")
('Prince Sherid', "I'm sure you do. We invited you here in the hopes of<br/>hiring you.")
('Prince Sherid', 'This is a joint request from Elsaim and the CID.')
('Agnès', "That's quite the pair...")
('Van', "I'm committing to nothing, but keep going.")
('Prince Sherid', "The short of it is, we'd like you to go on another trip<br/>for us.")
('Prince Sherid', 'To the home of the Verne Company: the city of Basel<br/>in the southwest.')
('Feri', "That's Calvard's biggest orbment manufacturer,<br/>isn't it?")
('Aaron', 'This sounds like a big one.')
('Naje', 'If you could take a look at the screen...')
('Kincaid', "Basel is an industrial city that is home to both the<br/>Verne Group's HQ and the Basel Institute<br/>of Science.")
('Kincaid', 'Its Artisanal District dates back to the Middle Ages,<br/>and it is surrounded by an abundance of nature.')
('Kincaid', "Our problem is that as of late, the city's<br/>orbal network has become unstable.")
('Kincaid', 'In addition, suspicious individuals have been sighted<br/>leaving and entering the city.')
('Agnès', '...!')
('Feri', "Don't tell me it's...?")
('Prince Sherid', "I know what you're thinking, but we can't assume<br/>that until we have all the facts—of which, we have<br/>very little.")
('Prince Sherid', 'Under normal circumstances, we would be well<br/>informed of the situation, as our country has deep<br/>ties with the institute.')
('Prince Sherid', "Unfortunately, its director—who also happens to be<br/>Verne's CEO—has been notably unforthcoming as<br/>of late.")
('Agnès', "That's...strange.")
('Agnès', "Isn't your country one of Verne's largest shareholders?")
('Prince Sherid', 'Yes, it is. We are not their principal shareholder, but<br/>we still wield considerable influence over<br/>the company.')
('Prince Sherid', 'Yet in spite of that fact, the CEO has been<br/>emphatically vague in response to our questions.<br/>We suspect he is merely buying time.')
('Prince Sherid', "For what, though, I do not know. But his sudden<br/>shift in behavior indicates he's hiding something—<br/>hence my request to you.")
('Risette', 'Hmm...')
('Aaron', 'Hmph.')
('Van', "You're not givin' me much to work with here.")
('Van', "And if you're looking for technical experts, you've<br/>come to the wrong place.")
('Prince Sherid', "Oh, I beg to differ! After all, you have one of<br/>Marduk's very own concierges in your employ.")
('Prince Sherid', "Also, a little birdie told me you're testing some<br/>revolutionary new technology at present.")
('Feri', 'Oh, you mean that simu...thingy?')
('Risette', "It's still undergoing testing, but we plan to reveal it to<br/>the public eventually.")
('Prince Sherid', "Good to hear. I'll most certainly be looking forward<br/>to it.")
('Prince Sherid', "Anyhow, if we took our request to the guild, it'd land<br/>at the bottom of their list of priorities, given that no<br/>civilian casualties have occurred.")
('Prince Sherid', "Also, much like the police, they're as wary as a fox<br/>with these sorts of mysteries.")
('Van', "Right. And if we're on the job, we can deal with any<br/>problems that you'd rather keep away from the<br/>public eye.")
('Van', 'The conditions are fair, but you better be willing to<br/>pay top mira for our services, or you can count us out.')
('Prince Sherid', "Oh, you needn't worry there. If anything, that makes<br/>you more trustworthy in my book.")
('Aaron', 'Is that a fact?')
('Feri', 'Well, I think we should definitely consider taking this<br/>on, especially if Almata is involved.')
('Agnès', "If possible, I'd like to ask one thing before we agree to<br/>take this on.")
('Agnès', "What's the CID's connection to this case?<br/>You haven't been upfront about that.")
('Prince Sherid', '...Oh?')
('Kincaid', 'Ever the sharp one.')
('Kincaid', 'Verne and the institute are currently part of two<br/>national projects.')
('Kincaid', 'One of them is for making the Xipha standard<br/>available to the general public—both at home<br/>and abroad.')
('Kincaid', 'The technology is a national secret, so our<br/>involvement should be no surprise.')
('Van', 'Makes sense.')
('Aaron', "Gotta stay on top of any leaks and scandals so they<br/>don't slip through the cracks.")
('Aaron', 'What about the other project?')
('Kincaid', 'Classified.')
('Aaron', 'Ah, come on.')
('Feri', 'Boo...')
('Prince Sherid', "Even I don't know the specifics there, so I'm in the<br/>same boat as you all.")
('Prince Sherid', "I did try pressing the president for details, but he<br/>simply wouldn't budge.")
('Kincaid', "Apologies. But that's all the more reason why I<br/>cannot divulge any information about the project.")
('Kincaid', 'The point is, there are many reasons for<br/>our involvement.')
('Van', '...')
('Aaron', 'This all sounds fishy as hell, but whatever. Get on<br/>with it.')
('Kincaid', "As you wish. The issue of the Xipha standard's<br/>funding source also needs to be addressed.")
('Kincaid', "And I will delegate that task to your group's chief<br/>and concierge.")
('Feri', 'Huh?')
('Agnès', 'What do you mean?')
('Van', "Since when did you become my boss? ...*sigh* Fine,<br/>I'll explain.")
('Van', "Xipha being Verne's sixth-generation combat<br/>orbment is common knowledge at this point.")
('Van', "But there's a little known fact about the project's<br/>humble beginnings: it got a massive capital injection<br/>from an interested party.")
('Van', 'And that party just so happens to be...')
('Risette', '...the Valis Investment Bank.')
('Risette', 'Which, as it so happens, is also the largest<br/>shareholder of Marduk—my employer.')
('Agnès', 'I-I see...')
('Aaron', "Sure feels like I'm hearing the name Valis a lot lately.")
('Feri', 'Valis? Oh, as in the city state?')
('Prince Sherid', "Correct. It's a giant port city in the Central East.")
('Prince Sherid', 'It may not have much land, but through trade in<br/>the south sea, its people amassed a great fortune,<br/>which they are investing all over the continent.')
('Prince Sherid', "They're both our allies and our competitors.<br/>The Valis Investment Bank is owned by them.")
('Feri', '...')
('Aaron', "So you're trying to drag our asses into a Central<br/>Eastern turf war—all so we can be your eyes and ears.")
('Aaron', 'Well, I guess they could be sending in their own<br/>spies, especially with state-level secrets up for grabs.')
('Agnès', "In short, you want us to investigate a highly complex<br/>situation from a neutral standpoint and get to the<br/>bottom of what's happening there.")
('Agnès', 'Does that about sum it up?')
('Kincaid', "I'll give you an 85 for that answer.")
('Kincaid', 'In the event that Valis attempts to interfere, we<br/>would also like you to act as a mediator.')
('Van', "You've got this all mapped out.")
('Risette', "Mediation is not one of our specialties, unfortunately,<br/>so I'm not certain if we are your best option for that.")
('Prince Sherid', 'On the contrary, I think you all are our safest bet on<br/>that front.')
('Prince Sherid', "Should you take our request, you will stay in Basel for<br/>three days. I'm sure there will be other 4SPGs you<br/>can juggle at the same time.")
('Prince Sherid', "We can't expect you to leave at once, but it would be<br/>best if you departed within the next few days.")
('Agnès', '(Wait...)')
('Van', "All right. We'll give it some thought when we<br/>get back.")
('Van', "Can't make any promises.")
('Prince Sherid', 'I understand.')
('Prince Sherid', "We won't be out of options if you refuse. The CID<br/>never puts all its eggs in one basket.")
('Kincaid', "Regardless, everything we've told you is<br/>strictly confidential.")
('Kincaid', 'Though I think a rather unexpected issue might work<br/>in our favor here.')
('Agnès', '(...)')
('Feri', '...?')
('Van', '...')
('Feri', "This is so exciting. It feels like we're in that spy movie<br/>we saw last month!")
('Agnès', "You really liked that one, didn't you?")
('Aaron', "I'd make fun of you for being a kid about it, but this<br/>whole thing's got my interest, too.")
('Quatre', 'But just how do they plan to establish contact<br/>with us?')
('Risette', 'My thoughts exactly. I assume it will involve the<br/>in-vehicle Xipha—')
('Van', "There they are. ...Wait. Ain't that...?")
('Agnès', 'Umm...')
('Quatre', "I feel like I've seen him somewhere before...")
('Aaron', "Oh, it's that smug-ass racer from a while back.")
('Risette', 'Maxim Lugan, the top Z1 racecar driver?')
('Feri', 'Yeah! That guy who always seems to be shooting<br/>himself in the foot.')
('Agnès', 'F-Feri...')
('Van', "We're Arkride Solutions. You the guy Bermotti<br/>wanted us to meet?")
('Maxim', "That's right. Maxim Lugan here. It's been a<br/>while, spriggan.")
('Maxim', "I'd like to ask you to do a job for me—or a 4SPG,<br/>as I believe you call them.")
('Maxim', 'Now, would it be a problem if we kept this<br/>conversation completely off the record?')
('Yumé', "Wheeeeee! VROOOM! VROOOOOOM! This car's<br/>the bestest!")
('Feri', "Isn't it?!")
('Aaron', 'Little kids are so easy to please.')
('Quatre', "And what's wrong with that? It's good to enjoy the<br/>little things in life.")
('Agnès', "I'm glad the inn was understanding about her coming<br/>with us.")
('Van', "Yeah. I was hoping we wouldn't have any issues since<br/>she's so young.")
('Van', "And sure enough, we didn't. The best inn in Longlai<br/>knows how to do right by its customers.")
('Risette', 'It was considerate of you to propose that we look<br/>after her.')
('Risette', 'Her guardians have much to discuss, after all.')
('Agnès', 'I imagine they got right into it as soon as we left.')
('Agnès', 'Maxim may end up having to talk with Victor, too.')
('Van', "There's no shortage of things he's gotta answer for.")
('Van', "If he wants to be a part of their family, he's gotta<br/>rebuild those burned bridges—brick by brick.")
('Aaron', "And if he screws up and gets himself burned, I'll<br/>point and laugh my ass off.")
('Quatre', '(Family...)')
(500, 'November 16th, 5:30PM')
('Yumé', "I've never seen so many cars in my whole life!")
('Aaron', 'What a pain in the ass. How much longer are we<br/>gonna be stuck here?')
('Quatre', 'Are the Edith freeways always so busy around<br/>this time?')
('Agnès', 'Not usually, no.')
('Judith', "It is rush hour right now, but the traffic's almost never<br/>this backed up.")
('Van', "Well, it can be if there's been an accident.")
('Feri', "Oh, what're we listening to?")
('Van', 'The news. I wanna see if something happened.')
(40000, "Really? We don't have confirmation yet? Then should<br/>we even be reporting on this?")
(40000, 'Well, I guess people do have a right to know, given<br/>that—wait, are we on?')
(40000, 'Ahem. We have breaking news this evening.')
(40000, 'Although this information has not yet been<br/>confirmed, it is believed that the northwestern—')
(40000, '...What did you say? They contacted US?')
(40000, "O-Our apologies. We have been given reason to<br/>doubt the veracity of tonight's report.")
(40000, 'Further details will be delivered in the<br/>7PM broadcast.')
('Aaron', '...The hell was that about?')
('Yumé', "Huh? What's going on?")
('Feri', "I-I don't know. But whatever that was, it didn't<br/>sound good.")
('Agnès', 'No, it did not...')
('Van', 'Risette, Quatre. Can you check the net? We might<br/>learn something there.')
('Quatre', "I suppose it's worth a try.")
('Risette', 'I will check every news site. One moment.')
('Judith', "I'll see if Nina or my agency knows what's up...<br/>Hmm?")
('Agnès', "I'm not getting any service out here.")
('Agnès', "I tried reaching out to Renne, but the call's not<br/>going through.")
('Van', "That's weird.")
('Van', "...Hmm? What's this?")
('Dingo', 'Van, I just sent something your way. You know<br/>the drill.')
('Dingo', "Hope all's well with you. Let's go for a drink at<br/>Bermotti's again sometime, all right?")
('Van', '(Oh? Looks like he sent me another encrypted file<br/>through the cloud.)')
('Van', "(I'll need to open it the usual way. Have to save this<br/>for later, though.)")
('Risette', 'It looks like access to the orbal network is<br/>being restricted.')
('Quatre', "And it's not just a problem for Edith. This is a<br/>countrywide issue.")
('Van', '...Definitely not normal.')
('Judith', 'You can say that again!')
('Aaron', 'This is stupid. Maybe Heiyue has some way<br/>around it.')
('Yumé', "Do you know what they're talking about, Feri?")
('Feri', 'No clue. This is all going right over my head.')
('Shizuna', 'That was a blast!')
('Shizuna', "You should maybe think about starting up a side<br/>hustle as a tour guide. I think you'd kill it!")
(500, 'December 3rd, 3:50PM')
('Van', 'Thanks, I guess?')
('Van', '(I only did a quick drive around, but nothing seemed<br/>out of the ordinary.)')
('Van', '(But then...)')
('Shizuna', "Edith really is a big city, isn't it?")
('Shizuna', "I've never been to Erebonia's capital, so I don't know<br/>how it measures up...")
('Shizuna', "...but I can compare it to Iska's. This city's probably<br/>just as big as that place.")
('Van', "You're talkin' about the Holy Iskan Empire that<br/>collapsed 130 years ago, yeah?")
('Shizuna', 'Mhm. The name only lives on through a union of<br/>cities in the same region.')
('Shizuna', "Well, I say 'union,' but they're always at each<br/>other's throats. It gives us consistent work, though, so<br/>you won't hear me complaining.")
('Van', "Lines up with the rumors I've heard.")
('Van', '...')
('Van', "Speaking of stuff I've heard, I was always under the<br/>impression you guys rarely left the East.")
('Van', "I know Calvard's raking in the dough these days...")
('Van', "...but it's strange that you've been chillin' here for over<br/>a year, considering you're Ikaruga's<br/>second-in-command. What's the deal there?")
('Shizuna', 'Well, well.')
('Shizuna', 'Something tells me you know what went down in<br/>Longlai at the start of the year. You know, the fight<br/>between me and a fellow disciple?')
('Shizuna', "If so, you must've caught on to the purpose of sealing<br/>off Kunlun.")
('Van', "I think you're overestimating me. Haven't got<br/>anything more than a vague idea.")
('Van', 'I do know about your disciple friend, though.<br/>Never met the guy myself, but we share a<br/>few acquaintances.')
('Van', "I also know what the Sword Hermit's up to and what<br/>Marduk's plotting. Wish I didn't, but I've got a nasty<br/>habit of pickin' up info I don't even want.")
('Shizuna', "Well, like it or not, you've gathered a lot of the<br/>pieces, but it doesn't sound like you've figured out<br/>how they fit together.")
('Shizuna', 'Maybe the CID can help you along? I bet someone<br/>there would let slip a detail or two around you.')
('Shizuna', '...On second thought, that may not happen while the<br/>Flying Swallow and that old friend of yours are at<br/>the helm. They run a tight ship.')
('Van', 'You seem to know a lot about that place...')
('Van', '...')
('Shizuna', "I know what you're thinking. It's not directly<br/>connected to what you're worrying about right now.")
('Shizuna', "So let that train of thought go for now and focus on<br/>what's in front of you.")
('Van', 'Are you...reading my mind?')
('Shizuna', "Of course not, silly. You're just an open book—and<br/>I've already pored over its contents.")
('Shizuna', "It's how I know the reason behind your fixation on<br/>debts...and that you are—and have been—living in<br/>fear of something.")
('Van', '...!')
('Van', 'Ah...')
('Shizuna', "Mine's going off, too.")
('Shizuna', "Heck of a coincidence. Or maybe it isn't one?")
('Van', "I don't have a free hand, so you pick it up.")
('Shizuna', 'Just when we were finally starting to break the ice...<br/>Oh, well.')
('Shizuna', "Wait, why's my phone...? Ohh. I think it's<br/>been hacked.")
('Van', "The hell? Oh, no. It's Oración all over again—and<br/>that can only mean...!")
('Melchior', 'Why, hello, dear victors and losers of the death game.<br/>Hope you missed me, because I missed you.')
('Melchior', 'And greetings to those uninvolved with the game.<br/>My name is Melchior, and I am—or was—an executive<br/>of Almata, a mafia that met an untimely demise.')
('Melchior', 'Enough about me, though. Congratulations on the<br/>anniversary of the revolution! Glory to Calvard.<br/>Hurrah. Three cheers and all that.')
('Melchior', 'In honor of this momentous occasion, I have come<br/>bearing a most wonderful gift. ❤')
('Shizuna', 'I had a feeling something bad was going to happen,<br/>but wow, things REALLY took a turn for the worse.')
('Shizuna', 'That looked like the kid I saw back in Longlai.')
('Van', "And those goons are back, too. Wish my eyes were<br/>playin' tricks on me...")
('Van', "We'll worry about that later, though. We've got more<br/>pressing problems to deal with.")
('Shizuna', 'So we do.')
('Shizuna', 'Got some denizens of the underworld on our hands.<br/>You call them devils here in the West, yeah?')
('Van', "Uh-huh. Looks like they're out to hunt down anyone<br/>who isn't frozen.")
('Van', 'Ready to team up again?')
('Van', 'Wanna team up?')
('Shizuna', 'Heck yeah!')
('Shizuna', 'Easy peasy. Those were probably low-ranking devils.')
('Van', "Wonder if they're in all the other districts.")
('Van', 'But more importantly...')
('Shizuna', 'Everyone around us has been frozen in time.')
('Shizuna', "Well, except you, me, Almata's leaders, and those<br/>other people we saw on stream.")
('Van', 'Yeah.')
('Van', "Bah. I can't make any calls, and the orbal net's<br/>down, too.")
('Van', 'Ah, good. My girl never lets me down.')
('Van', "(Not sure why the other cars around here aren't<br/>working, though...)")
('Van', "Anyway, we're not gonna learn anything if we stay<br/>out here.")
('Van', "I'm gonna hit all the districts and gather up<br/>my employees. What're you plannin' on doing?")
('Shizuna', "I'll stick with you. I might get a better idea as to<br/>what's going on that way.")
('Shizuna', "This area is in the south part of the city, isn't it?<br/>Where are you going to go first?")
('Van', 'Let me see where we are exactly.')
('Van', 'Closest districts from here are Old Town, Riverside,<br/>and Central Station.')
('Van', "We can leave as soon as we decide where to go first.<br/>I'll be countin' on you.")
('Shizuna', "Right. As long as I'm here, you won't have to worry<br/>about a thing.")
('System', 'Shizuna has temporarily joined the party as a guest.')
('System', 'Due to the spread of Pandemonium, you are unable<br/>to use the orbal network.')
('System', 'Furthermore, since you cannot contact Quatre, the<br/>Custom menu from Orbment in the main menu<br/>is inaccessible.')
('System', 'To advance the main story, inspect the car and select<br/>a destination.')
('Van', '(Hmm... Now where should we go first?)')
('System', 'Once a district has been selected, the others will be<br/>temporarily unavailable.')
('Van', "(Ferida was the one stationed in this district.<br/>I'm guessin' she's still there, too.)")
('Van', "(Odds are she hasn't been frozen, but I've still gotta<br/>find her—and fast!)")
('Van', "(Aaron was the one stationed in this district.<br/>I'm guessing he's still there, too.)")
('Van', "(Odds are he hasn't been frozen, but I've still gotta<br/>find him—and fast!)")
('Van', "(Risette was the one stationed in this district.<br/>I'm guessin' she's still there, too.)")
('Van', "(Odds are she hasn't been frozen, but I've still gotta<br/>find her—and fast!)")
('System', "Van's group took the truck to the mechanic in the<br/>Riverside District for some quick maintenance.")
('System', 'After that, they made their way towards Expressway<br/>1, where everyone was beginning to gather.')
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', "I'm glad you all could make it.")
('Renne', "We've been waiting for you.")
('Feri', 'Kasim!')
('Risette', 'Mr. Thorndyke!')
('Van', 'Arkride Solutions, at your service.')
('Van', "So, what're two Marduk bigwigs doin' out here?")
('General Manager Thorndyke', "We were given an offer that we simply<br/>couldn't refuse.")
('General Manager Thorndyke', 'Not to mention, this is a golden opportunity to<br/>capture some excellent data, and I fully intend to<br/>capitalize on it.')
('Aaron', "Well, I'm glad you've got your priorities straight here.")
('Quatre', "You're making use of the orbal network, huh?")
('Professor Cronkite', "Indeed. Our plan is to pierce the barrier with a<br/>concentrated blast from Kasim's buster lance, and we<br/>will need the orbal network to do so.")
('Professor Cronkite', 'Access to the network here in Edith is limited at<br/>present, but it is still up and running—just in a<br/>simulated state.')
('Professor Cronkite', 'We will funnel a majority of its processing power into<br/>his weapon and use a vast quantity of shards to fire a<br/>concentrated blast.')
('Professor Hamilton', 'The primary and secondary barriers were created and<br/>are maintained by a single Genesis.')
('Professor Hamilton', 'If we can overwhelm its power—even if but for a<br/>moment—we can create an opening.')
('Renne', "However, we feared that the beam wouldn't be strong<br/>enough to break both barriers on its own.")
('Renne', 'So we called in some help. With those two, the<br/>balance of power should shift in our favor.')
('Renne', "They will be firing two supporting lasers with the<br/>power of their Stigmas. We're taking a page out of<br/>that spiky onion priest's book.")
('Bergard', 'Aha. Of course.')
('Van', "You're referring to that trick he pulled out of the hat<br/>in Crossbell four years ago, right?")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'So you know about that, do you? Why am I<br/>not surprised?')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'That technique is reliant on our Merkabahs. If we<br/>had ours, we could have spared ourselves the dishonor<br/>of working with those scoundrels.')
('Dominion Celis', 'Yeah, but we just gotta suck it up.')
('Dominion Celis', "We already shook on it with them, so we'll just have<br/>to wash our hands later.")
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', 'Thank you for your cooperation.')
('General Manager Thorndyke', 'Oh, dear. It looks like my plan to sell our services to<br/>the Holy City will be more of an uphill battle than<br/>I anticipated.')
('Feri', "I, uh, don't understand what anyone's saying, but it all<br/>sounds neat.")
('Aaron', "Trust the pros to think outside the box. Guess there's<br/>hope for us after all.")
('Judith', "Wait, where's the bracers and CID agents? I thought<br/>they were a part of this.")
('Judith', "Actually, it's not just them. There's a lot of other<br/>people who should be here that aren't.")
('Kilika', 'All of them are on standby. We have them at our<br/>beck and call, and they will be ready to spring<br/>into action...')
('Kilika', '...should this operation end in failure.')
('Quatre', 'So you already have a contingency plan in place.')
('Agnès', "That's good. There's no guarantee we'll succeed.")
('Van', 'Never a bad idea to have a plan B in your<br/>back pocket.')
('Van', "After all, if we can't break through the barrier—or we<br/>screw up later on...")
('Van', "...then Pandemonium's gonna stick around for good,<br/>and its reach'll extend beyond the capital.")
('Bergard', 'The whole of Calvard—and perhaps even the rest of<br/>the continent—will be swallowed up if we let<br/>that happen.')
('Bergard', "It's only right that they draw up a backup plan or two.")
('Kilika', "Precisely. There's too much at stake here.")
('Van', "Take it René's part of the backup crew? Heh.<br/>That guy has way too much faith in me.")
('Kilika', 'Heheh. Oh, and incidentally, he asked me to deliver a<br/>message to you.')
('Kilika', "'I expect that you'll repay me for all this help at a<br/>later date. I'll settle for a drink at Bermotti's.'")
('Kilika', "'You will be buying one for Elaine, too, of course.'")
('Van', 'That son of a...')
('Agnès', "Heehee. I don't think you'll be getting out of<br/>that one.")
('Chief Engineer Giscard', "Preparations are complete. We're good to<br/>go whenever!")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "The orbal network's remaining processing power has<br/>been transferred to the buster lance.")
('Professor Hamilton', 'Thank you both for your assistance.')
('Professor Cronkite', 'Well? Are you ready to go?')
('Van', 'Damn right, we are!')
('Agnès', 'Thank you, everyone!')
('Professor Hamilton', 'First, we must charge the buster lance to just below<br/>critical levels. If you would, good sir?')
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', 'Understood. Charging now.')
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', '3%... 5%... 10%... 15%... 20%...')
('Dominion Celis', "Damn. Guess they don't call him the strongest<br/>warrior for nothing. He's earned that rep.")
('Dominion Celis', "Leon! We can't let that jackass show us up!")
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', "Oh, I couldn't agree more!")
('Dominion Celis', 'Searing seal of mine, shining from the abyss...')
('Leon (Wearing Overcoat)', 'Glacial seal of mine, shining from the abyss...')
('Renne', "I can handle the fusion process myself, chief!<br/>You just say the word, and I'll get it done.")
('Kilika', 'Understood.')
('Kilika', 'Three... Two... One... FIRE!')
('Dominion Celis', "Pulverize it! Solar Prominence!<br/>Perforate it! Murgleys' Torment!")
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', 'Charge complete. Shahmat Strike!')
('Renne', "(Now to convert their Stigmas' data and encode it<br/>as shards... There!)")
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', 'Arkride, Ferida! Finish this!')
('Renne', "You've got this, Agnès! Come back safely, everyone!")
('Feri', "I won't let you down, Kasim!")
('Agnès', "All right. It's time we end this nightmare!")
('Van', 'I hear you there!')
('Van', "It's on the outskirts of the 10th District, yeah?<br/>We're about ten minutes from there.")
('Van', "Guessin' it's a pretty big place?")
('Agnès', "No, not at all. It's just your average suburban<br/>detached home.")
('Agnès', 'We have a modest garden that Mom used to grow<br/>flowers and herbs in. She had quite the green thumb.')
('Agnès', "Oh, and we've got our sweet little dog, too.<br/>His name's Alphonse, and he's a good boy.")
('Agnès', "He mostly stays at our official residence these days.<br/>I haven't seen him in ages, so I've missed him<br/>very much.")
('Agnès', "I'll have to introduce you to him! The two of them<br/>should be back home by now.")
('Van', "Actually, I wasn't planning to stay. I'm just gonna<br/>drop you off and—")
('Van', "Wait, what do you mean by 'two of them'? You aren't<br/>talkin' about your dad, are you?")
('Agnès', 'Hmm? Of course I am. He was up to the neck in<br/>work until just yesterday.')
('Agnès', "But today is the start of his end-of-year vacation, so<br/>we're finally going to spend some time together.")
('Agnès', 'I believe he wants to have a talk with you—about<br/>your compensation and a few other things.')
('Van', "Oh, c'mon. There's no way he was serious about<br/>the pay.")
('Van', "That place'll be crawlin' with security, so sorry, but I<br/>ain't gonna—")
('Agnès', "Heehee. Don't worry about that. They only guard the<br/>outside of the house, so they'll leave us alone.")
('Agnès', "Also...I've got a delicious Andalucía winter tart.<br/>Limited edition.")
('Agnès', "You can share it with Dad. I'll brew your coffee while<br/>you chat away.")
('Van', "You gotta be shittin' me...<br/>When the hell'd you kids get so damn sly?!")
('System', 'With the matchups decided, everyone got in their<br/>cars—and they were off to the races.')
('System', 'The first round pitted Junifer against Tebo.')
('System', "Junifer's Leno sedan had the edge in traction, due to<br/>the love and care she put into tuning it.")
('System', 'As the race went on, she slowly but surely narrowed<br/>the gap between her and Tebo.')
('System', 'However, her vehicle lacked the horsepower required<br/>to best his sedan—which boasted a roaring engine<br/>that ultimately led him to victory.')
('System', 'For the next race, Graham stepped up to the plate,<br/>ready and willing to avenge Junifer.')
('System', "Graham's Ingert was a lightning-fast sports car, but<br/>Roger's decked-out sedan was no slouch, either.")
('System', 'It was a close race—with both cars being neck and<br/>neck from start to finish.')
('System', "In the end, Graham's powerful traction allowed him<br/>to emerge victorious by a hair's breadth.")
('System', 'After that, it was time for the third round<br/>to commence.')
('Hermès', "We're at 1-1 right now, so we don't have this in the<br/>bag just yet.")
('Hermès', 'But that just makes this all the more exciting.')
('Damian', "It'll be a cold day in hell before I lose to some pathetic<br/>courier lady.")
('Damian', 'Get ready to choke on my dust!')
('Hermès', 'You stole my line.')
('Hermès', "The starting line's up ahead. Time to get serious.")
('Graham', 'Holy hell! Look at her go!')
('Junifer', "We can't even see her anymore! Haha! Eat that, loser!")
('Van', "'Fraid it's a little early to celebrate.")
('Damian', "That thing's acceleration isn't half bad, but its top<br/>speed doesn't hold a candle to my bike's!")
('Hermès', "Specs aren't the only things that matter in a race,<br/>you know.")
('Hermès', '...?!')
('Damian', 'On that point, you and I agree!')
('Junifer', 'That scumbag just rammed his handlebars<br/>against hers! Talk about dangerous!')
('Van', "The fact that he pulled it off without losin' his<br/>balance shows he's no amateur.")
('Van', "It's still reckless, though. These guys are<br/>freakin' crazy.")
('Damian', "C'mon! I dare you to try and overtake me again!")
('Damian', "If you do, I'll hit your dingy little bike with everything<br/>I've got!")
('Hermès', '...')
('Damian', "Aww, what's the matter? Can't keep up? Or is our<br/>wimpy-ass courier getting cold feet?")
('Damian', "There's less than 500 arge until the finish line.<br/>Victory's as good as mine!")
('Hermès', '(This is the decisive moment.)')
('Hermès', "(I can slow down, make him think I've given up, and<br/>speed past him when he least expects it—or I can rev<br/>up right now and punch it.)")
('Hermès', '...')
('Damian', 'Pfft. Throwing in the towel already?')
('Damian', "What a wuss. Just stick to carrying around people's<br/>junk in the future.")
('Junifer', 'Haha, YES! Go courier lady!')
('Graham', 'She caught him off guard by speeding past him at the<br/>last second!')
('Graham', 'What an incredible strategy!')
('Van', 'She even had me fooled. That was one hell of a<br/>secret weapon.')
('Hermès', 'If I use that...')
('Hermès', "No, I really don't want to pull that out here!")
('Damian', "Still got some fight in you, huh? Can't say I didn't see<br/>that coming!")
('Damian', "You're one stubborn lady! Hahaha!")
('Hermès', "He's showing off what that ETWS bike is<br/>capable of... I don't think I can turn the tables<br/>on him!")
('Graham', 'They crossed the finish line at the same time!')
('Van', 'Nah, I think he was just barely ahead of her.')
('Van', 'Nice job.')
('Van', 'Was that a turbocharger?')
('Hermès', "Something along those lines. I was hoping I could<br/>win without revealing it, but them's the breaks.")
('Van', 'What happened? You looked like you<br/>were hesitating.')
('Hermès', 'I was—and unfortunately, it cost me the race.')
('Van', "Well, guess I'm up next.")
('Graham', "Go get 'em, Van! Knock the High Bloods off their<br/>high horses!")
('Van', 'He really did customize every part of that ETWS car,<br/>from the suspension to the spoiler.')
('Lucio', "You must be daft if you think you can take me with<br/>that little girl's car.")
('Lucio', "You've slighted me with your hubris—and I will make<br/>you pay for it!")
('Van', "There's more cars on the road now. Usin' the<br/>turbocharger would be way too risky.")
('Van', 'Bah. He swerved around those cars like it<br/>was nothing!')
('Van', 'Thankfully, all this traffic is preventing him from<br/>hitting his top speed, so I can keep up with him.')
('Van', "Can't get too cocky here, though. He might not be on<br/>Maxim's level, but he's still a force to be<br/>reckoned with.")
('Lucio', 'I had hoped he had a trick up his sleeve like that<br/>woman did. I was so looking forward to making a fool<br/>of him.')
('Lucio', "But it's clear he has nothing. What a disappointment.")
('Lucio', "He seemed so sure of himself, too. I suppose it's up to<br/>me to put him in his place.")
('Lucio', "But it's clear he has nothing. What a disappointment.")
('Van', "We're approachin' the point where the traffic from<br/>the Riverside District joins the expressway.")
('Van', 'At this time of day, maybe I could...')
('Lucio', "Looks like he couldn't keep pace with me.<br/>How pathetic.")
('Lucio', "Hmph. Someone forgot to take out<br/>yesterday's garbage.")
('Lucio', 'Why must there be so many of these infernal trucks<br/>on the expressway at night?')
('Lucio', '...What?!')
('Van', "Hah. Your lack of knowledge of the area is comin'<br/>back to haunt you, bud!")
('Van', 'Damn. He caught up faster than I thought he would.')
('Lucio', 'Well, look at that! So you do have a modicum of skill<br/>after all!')
('Lucio', "Too bad it's futile. That pile of scrap can't match my<br/>car's acceleration and speed.")
('Van', "I might be able to secure victory if I use my<br/>turbocharger, but it'd be risky. Should I do it?")
('Van', 'If I wanna win this, I gotta pull out all the stops!')
('Lucio', "Heheh. Did you really think I wouldn't have one of<br/>those, too?")
('Van', 'Shit!')
('Van', 'Bah. He just had to overtake me at the last<br/>damn stretch.')
('Van', "No, I can't risk hurtin' anyone!")
('Lucio', 'I will accept no less than an overwhelming victory!')
('Van', "He's got a turbocharger?! Don't use that here! It's<br/>too dangerous!")
('Lucio', 'WHOA!')
('Van', 'Tried to warn ya, dumbass.')
('Isla', 'I thought my heart was going to jump out of<br/>my chest!')
('Agnès', "I was definitely anxious for a moment, but Van's<br/>silver tongue saved the day.")
('Judith', "I'm impressed he came up with that cover story on<br/>the fly.")
('Judith', "You even had an ID card to back it up. I'm guessing<br/>that's not the only one you have?")
('Van', "Yep. You can't deny they come in handy in times<br/>like these.")
('Judith', "Hey, I'm not saying it's a bad thing. We might've<br/>been in a bind if you didn't have it.")
('Agnès', "All right. Now all that's left is to get on out of<br/>the city!")
('Isla', "Wait, isn't there another checkpoint when we get off<br/>the expressway?")
('Van', "Yeah. When we get there, I think the best plan's to...")
('Van', "(No, that'd be too risky. I need to play it safe until we<br/>get out of the city.)")
('Agnès', 'Yes, that might work.')
('Judith', "Just try not to stay too close to the trucks, or we might<br/>cause an accident. And remember that if we're too far<br/>away, we'll be spotted for sure.")
('Judith', "...Wait. Isn't this plan kinda reckless?")
('Van', "Traffic's lighter than usual. Though I guess the roads<br/>aren't usually busy this time of day.")
('Hermès', 'True, but I imagine a lot of people are staying indoors<br/>due to the emergency declaration.')
('Hermès', 'Also, I doubt many are in the mood to go out and<br/>have fun right now.')
('Van', "Listen. Thanks for thinkin' about me, Hermès.")
('Van', "But I'm fine. Really.")
('Hermès', 'Are you trying to convince me—or yourself?')
('Van', '...')
('Hermès', "I'm upset about what happened to Creil, too.")
('Hermès', 'The people there were always good to me whenever I<br/>dropped by for work.')
('Van', 'Yeah. They welcomed everyone who showed up to<br/>their doorstep, even if you were an outsider or<br/>a jaeger.')
('Van', 'Their kindness and hospitality touched Agnès, Feri,<br/>and I when we went there a couple of months back.')
('Van', 'I hear he stopped by there a lot, too.')
('Hermès', "You're talking about your reporter friend, right?<br/>I worked with him many times over the years.")
('Hermès', "He was a good man. The world's a poorer place<br/>without him.")
('Van', '...')
('Van', "We should never take today for granted, because no<br/>one's guaranteed a tomorrow.")
('Van', 'He and I both understood that, and yet...')
('Hermès', "And yet you're preparing to fight the people who<br/>took him from us.")
('Hermès', "You're going to stop the mafia from stealing the<br/>futures of countless others like him.")
('Hermès', "That's the decision you've made as Van Arkride,<br/>isn't it?")
('Hermès', "I'm not going to ask why you came to that decision...")
('Hermès', '...because I already know the answer.')
('Hermès', "You're not the kind of person who runs from<br/>adversity—you tackle it head on.")
('Van', '...')
('Van', "Never thought I'd hear somethin' like that from you<br/>of all people. Think you've got me all figured<br/>out, huh?")
('Hermès', "We've known each other for a long time now. I'd like<br/>to think I've got your number at this point.")
('Van', "Heh. Guess I'm slippin', then.")
('Van', "I'll have to do a better job keeping up the mask.<br/>Can't have my assistants worryin' about me.")
('Hermès', "I know there are sides of yourself you don't want your<br/>assistants to see. But remember this, Arkride:")
('Hermès', "You aren't the only one who wants to help others—<br/>there are people in your life who want to extend a<br/>hand to you, too.")
('Van', 'Got it.')
('Hermès', "The rain's finally letting up. It should be a smooth<br/>ride from here.")
('Van', "Oh? You headin' out of the city?")
('Hermès', "Yeah. I've got an urgent delivery to make, so I'm<br/>going to get it done now.")
('Van', "Need a hand? I doubt it'll be easy to get outta Edith<br/>with the emergency declaration in effect.")
('Hermès', "I'll be fine. They should've been told to expect me.")
('Van', '(...Hmm?)')
('Van', "Okay, then. You're a pro courier, so I'm sure you<br/>know what you're doin'. Safe travels.")
('Hermès', 'Same to you.')
('Hermès', "If you need help with anything, just give me a call,<br/>and I'll be over before you know it. I look forward to<br/>your continued business.")
('Van', "And you'll have it. Peace out.")
('Van', 'Thanks, Hermès.')
('System', 'Van then made his way back to Edith, and upon<br/>reuniting with the others, he got back to work.')
('Van', "All right. Five minutes till your show starts. I think<br/>we're gonna make it in time.")
('Van', "Hmm? Y'all okay back there?")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'Heehee...')
('Shaheena', 'Hahaha!')
('Shaheena', "I felt like I was in a car chase scene in a movie!<br/>My heart's still pounding like crazy!")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "You have our thanks, Van. Had it not been for you,<br/>we would've surely been late.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "We're in your debt once again.")
('Van', "Hey, I'm just doin' what any of your other fans would<br/>do if they were in my place.")
('Van', "Anyway, I'm impressed you could handle my crazy<br/>drivin' and laugh about it afterwards. You two are<br/>made of sterner stuff.")
('Shaheena', "I mean, I won't deny it was a little scary.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "But we had faith that you would keep us out of<br/>harm's way.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "We'll invite you to one of our performances in the<br/>future as thanks. I hope you'll be able to come.")
('Shaheena', 'Yeah! Please do!')
('Van', "Lookin' forward to it already. I'll ask the others if<br/>they'd like to tag along, too.")
('Van', "All righty. We're almost there now. Good luck,<br/>you two.")
('Shaheena', 'Thank you!')
('System', 'In the end, Van was able to see the two sisters safely<br/>to Trion Tower.')
('System', 'On his way back to the office, he listened to their<br/>performance on the radio, which seemed to be a<br/>roaring success.')
('Damian', 'Wha...?!')
