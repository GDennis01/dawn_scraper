('System', 'The bridge has collapsed.')
('Agnès', "Well, I don't think we'll be crossing this<br/>anytime soon.")
('Van', "Yeah, we can only use it during high tide. We'll have<br/>to look for another way around.")
('System', 'Leave the Eroded Cave?')
('Van', 'You mind if we head back to town real quick?')
('Kwan', "Of course. I'll be waiting here for when you get back!")
('System', 'Return to the Eastern Quarter?')
('Van', "Actually, I think we'll stick around.")
('Agnès', 'Then shall we get back to work?')
('System', 'Return to the Eastern Quarter?')
('Feri', 'This place is beautiful!')
('Agnès', 'You can say that again.')
('Kwan', 'Hello! You must be the fixers who took our request.<br/>Welcome to the Eroded Cave!')
('Kwan', "My name is Kwan, and I'll be serving as your<br/>guide today.")
('Van', "Nice to meet'cha.")
('Kwan', 'Likewise! Now, then. Allow me to lead you through<br/>the cave.')
('Kwan', 'Please take a look at the two passageways.')
('Kwan', 'Over the years, the waves dissolved the brittle parts of<br/>the surface rock, which created these two holes in<br/>the—')
('Van', 'Hey, hold up a sec.')
('Van', "Is it just me, or are you givin' us the tourist treatment?")
('Van', 'I thought you were supposed to take us to<br/>the monster.')
('Kwan', 'Oh, I have every intention of doing so.')
('Kwan', "However, we wanted to provide a little treat to you,<br/>since you're Heiyue's honored guests.")
('Kwan', 'Lady Ashen requested that we give you a full tour of<br/>the cave!')
('Van', 'Well, that was...uhh...nice of her, I guess?')
('Agnès', "I certainly won't object.")
('Feri', "Isn't it a little dangerous to be doing this, though?<br/>I'm sensing a lot of monsters around here.")
('Feri', "Are you sure it's safe for you to tag along, ma'am?")
('Kwan', "Oh, don't you worry about a thing!")
('Kwan', 'Our tour company is run by Heiyue, so all of its<br/>employees, including myself, are Heiyue operatives.')
('Kwan', "I'm certainly not the strongest in the organization,<br/>but I can hold my own in a fight!")
('Van', 'Since when did Langport have badass tour<br/>guide ladies?')
('Agnès', 'Heiyue sure has a lot of interesting people in<br/>their employ.')
('Agnès', '(Though it is a little chilling to see how much<br/>influence they have in this town.)')
('Kwan', 'Anyway, let me tell you a little more about the<br/>Eroded Cave.')
('Kwan', 'Have you heard of the famous legend involving it?')
('Agnès', "Well, we heard of it, but we don't know any of<br/>the particulars.")
('Kwan', 'Wonderful! Allow me to explain, then.')
('Kwan', "This is a story that's been passed down for<br/>many generations.")
('Kwan', 'At the heart of the Eroded Cave lies a precious<br/>treasure: the Wind Spirit Stone.')
('Feri', "Ooh. That's a cool name!")
('Kwan', 'Energy from all over gathered here in this cave, and it<br/>crystallized over countless centuries.')
('Kwan', 'The stone possessed immense magical power, and it<br/>captivated the hearts and minds of many with its<br/>mystical allure.')
('Kwan', 'Both humans and monsters alike were drawn to it.')
('Kwan', 'Soon enough, the land became infested with powerful<br/>demonic beasts that had been granted the favor of<br/>the stone.')
('Feri', 'Th-That sounds bad!')
('Feri', 'Were the people of Langport okay?!')
('Kwan', 'Yes, they were fine. In spite of the danger, many<br/>jaegers and bandits traveled here in search of<br/>the stone.')
('Kwan', 'However, none of them returned—and shortly<br/>thereafter, travel to this island was strictly forbidden<br/>for many years.')
('Agnès', "What a terrifying legend. I wasn't expecting it to be<br/>so...dark.")
('Van', "And now you're guidin' us right into that same<br/>hotbed of monsters.")
('Kwan', 'Correct! There are lots of nasty little beasts out and<br/>about, which makes the story all the more believable.')
('Kwan', "We don't have any issue with them being here.<br/>The real problem is the large one that is roaming<br/>deep within.")
('Kwan', "If we get ambushed along the way, we'll just have to<br/>make short work of them!")
('Agnès', "I've...never seen a tour guide with such nerves of steel.")
('Van', "Too bad she ain't gonna be much of an asset 'cause<br/>we're the ones who'll be doin' the monster bashing.")
('Feri', "That's fine. We're more than up to the task!")
('Kwan', 'I like your enthusiasm!')
('Kwan', "Now, let us commence the tour in earnest! We'll be<br/>heading through the left passageway.")
('Kwan', 'Oh, and if you ever need to return to the city, just let<br/>me know.')
('System', 'Kwan is now accompanying the party.')
('Kwan', 'You may have noticed this already, but the terrain<br/>here is quite complex.')
('Kwan', 'Back by the entrance, the water recedes during low<br/>tide, which makes the other passageway traversable.')
('Agnès', "Oh, so we would get a completely different<br/>experience if we came back when the tide's low.")
('Kwan', "Exactly! Also, believe it or not, there's another legend<br/>about that.")
('Kwan', "It's said that those who visit the cave during<br/>high tide...")
('Kwan', '...will often fall prey to vicious monsters, who will<br/>grab you by the feet and drag you underwater.')
('Kwan', 'After that, you will be torn to shreds and devoured by<br/>ravenous undersea beasts.')
('Agnès', 'T-Torn to shreds? Devoured...?!')
('Kwan', 'And when low tide comes around, you will find piles<br/>and piles of jagged bones and tattered flesh.')
('Kwan', "That's why some call this area 'Aquatic Hell.' It's the<br/>first obstacle of the Eroded Cave.")
('Feri', 'Oh, I get it. The cave must be testing the courage and<br/>willpower of anyone who comes here.')
('Van', "That's a pretty damn grotesque bit of fiction.<br/>You sure that ain't a little much for your<br/>average tourist?")
('Kwan', 'Not at all. Our visitors tell us they find it thrilling!')
('Kwan', "Oh, there's also the tale of the young man who<br/>surpassed the legends.")
('Kwan', 'Would you like to hear about that one?')
('Agnès', "Hmm... Well, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't curious.")
('Agnès', 'Oops. Maybe we should save it for another time.')
('Kwan', 'Oh, dear. We appear to be surrounded.')
('Van', 'Not for long.')
('Van', "Let's mop the floor with these chumps.")
('Feri', "Right! I'm not sure if they're the monsters from<br/>the legend...")
('Feri', "...but I don't need confirmation that bad. Let's beat<br/>them up!")
('Agnès', "I've got your backs!")
('Kwan', 'Phew! Excellent work, everyone!')
('Kwan', "I'd heard you all were tough, but I didn't realize you<br/>were THAT strong!")
('Agnès', 'Well, thank you, but honestly, I felt like I was having<br/>trouble keeping up with them in that fight.')
('Feri', "You say that, but your footwork was way better<br/>than ours. You aren't being held down by the terrain<br/>at all!")
('Van', 'Anyhow, there are a lot more monsters here than<br/>I thought.')
('Van', "Guess gettin' to the big baddie ain't gonna be a walk<br/>in the park.")
('Feri', "Yeah, but I don't mind. I'm having fun walking<br/>around and taking in the view.")
('Feri', "Let's keep it up, you guys!")
('Kwan', "Heehee. I'm glad you're enjoying yourself.")
('Kwan', 'Ah, by the way, I have rescue equipment on hand in<br/>case anyone falls into the water.')
('Kwan', "So if you were worried about that, don't stress!<br/>Just enjoy the tour.")
('Agnès', 'All right.')
('Kwan', 'Now, take a look at the hole in the rocks<br/>straight ahead.')
('Kwan', 'You can get a nice view of the sea through there.')
('Feri', "Holy moley! You aren't kidding!")
('Van', 'Wonder where these holes came from.')
('Kwan', "Actually, there's another legend about that.<br/>This place is said to be the second obstacle of the<br/>Eroded Cave.")
('Agnès', "I'm guessing it's too much to hope that this story will<br/>be a happy one?")
('Kwan', "Sorry to say, but yes. This place is known as<br/>Death's Head.")
('Kwan', "It's a nesting ground for monsters.")
('Kwan', 'According to the legend, the ground was once littered<br/>with the skulls and bones of human beings.')
('Kwan', 'It is said that the souls of fallen challengers are cursed<br/>to wander this place for all eternity.')
('Kwan', 'And their corpses, longing for salvation, would pick<br/>themselves off the ground, walk over to the stone<br/>walls, and claw at them day in and day out.')
('Kwan', "That's how the holes in the walls formed.")
('Kwan', 'At night, their lingering malice was said to have<br/>poured out through them, turning the sea a<br/>crimson red.')
('Van', 'Do you seriously feed tourists these<br/>creepy-as-hell stories?')
('Agnès', "I'm worried you'll scare people away with them.")
('Feri', "Even if it's just a made-up story, I feel so bad for the<br/>fallen warriors. I hope Arusha grants them salvation.")
('Kwan', 'I was going to save this part for later, but apparently,<br/>this really was a dangerous place back in the day.')
('Kwan', 'The rock formations in the wall actually got their<br/>shape from the crashing waves.')
('Kwan', 'I believe that over the next few centuries, the stone<br/>wall will cease to exist.')
('Van', 'I think we need to cut story time short. We<br/>got company.')
('Kwan', 'What? Again?!')
('Feri', "Let's take them out before more join the pack!")
('Agnès', 'Kwan, please get behind us!')
('Agnès', 'Phew. That takes care of that.')
('Kwan', 'Well done!')
('Kwan', "All right. It won't be long before we arrive at<br/>our destination.")
('Kwan', 'The third obstacle is just a little ways from here.')
('Kwan', 'The monster should be lying in wait there.')
('Kwan', 'Just a little bit more to go, everyone!')
('Van', "Good. I'm just about ready to wrap this up.")
('Kwan', 'We have arrived.')
('Kwan', 'That large beast should be dead ahead!')
('Agnès', "Are you sure? I don't see it anywhere.")
('Van', 'Eyes up.')
('Agnès', 'Huh?')
('Feri', 'Oh, there it is!')
('Kwan', 'Whoa!')
('Kwan', 'This monster definitely matches the description from<br/>the report!')
('Van', "Looks like this guy's all alone. That'll make this<br/>much easier.")
('Van', "Let's send old crab meat to a watery grave, girls!")
('Agnès', 'Gladly!')
('Feri', "You're going down!")
('Feri', 'All right! The battle is won!')
('Van', "That thing didn't stand a chance.")
('Kwan', 'You all were incredible!')
('Kwan', 'Now that the monster has been taken care of, the<br/>smaller ones should depart in time. They were drawn<br/>in by it, it seems.')
('Kwan', 'Thanks to you, we should be able to conduct our<br/>tours again soon.')
('Kwan', "I'll be sure to gush about you all to Lady Ashen!")
('Feri', 'Aww. Thanks!')
('Agnès', "Well, I think it's time for us to be heading back.")
('Agnès', 'Ah, but before that, I wanted to ask if there was a<br/>legend tied to the third obstacle.')
('Van', "Oh, yeah. Was wonderin' about that.")
('Kwan', 'As a matter of fact, there is! Follow me.')
('Kwan', 'The Wind Spirit Stone was said to be around here.')
('Kwan', "Those who were fortunate enough to make it this far<br/>would've bore witness to its dazzling beauty.")
('Kwan', 'However, those who dared to reach out to the stone<br/>would awaken the wicked spirit that resided within.')
('Kwan', 'This spirit would create raging tornados, swallowing<br/>the stone seekers whole and leaving not a trace of<br/>their mortal bodies behind.')
('Kwan', "And that's why no one who came to this island ever<br/>returned alive. The end.")
('Agnès', "That's quite the unsettling conclusion. I know those<br/>legends are all fiction, but they still give me the chills.")
('Van', "You said, 'the end,' but there's more to the story,<br/>isn't there?")
('Feri', "Oh, yeah! You didn't tell us about the young man<br/>who surpassed the legends!")
('Kwan', 'You have an excellent memory.')
('Kwan', 'This is a true story from some fifty years ago.<br/>One day, a ferocious monster that resembled a wicked<br/>spirit appeared in the Eroded Cave.')
('Kwan', 'It had the power to control the wind itself, leading to<br/>stormy waters—and the surface of the sea was painted<br/>red with the blood of fishes.')
('Agnès', 'Those sound eerily similar to those old legends, even<br/>if the details differ slightly.')
('Kwan', 'Jaegers and execution squads traveled to the island to<br/>quell the chaos, but they all met their demise.')
('Kwan', 'It was as though the legends had become reality.')
('Kwan', "But in the wake of the city's despair, a new legend<br/>was born—the legend of a young man who conquered<br/>the legends!")
('Van', "Ah, so that's where he comes in.")
('Kwan', 'Despite his youth, his martial arts prowess rivaled that<br/>of a master practitioner.')
('Kwan', "He traversed the perilous cave, swatting away the evil<br/>spirit's minions left and right—until he finally met<br/>his prey.")
('Kwan', 'Even in the face of its overwhelming strength, the<br/>young man—armed only with his Gekka skills—<br/>vanquished the spirit by cutting it in two.')
('Feri', "That guy must've been one heck of a warrior!")
('Kwan', 'After that, the smaller monsters fled the cave, and<br/>peace was restored to all.')
('Kwan', 'Whether the Wind Spirit Stone truly exists still<br/>remains a mystery. Only the young man knows the<br/>answer to it.')
('Kwan', "It's said that this was only the first of many<br/>adventures he had on his journey.")
('Van', 'Not a bad story.')
('Van', "And the fact that it's true makes it even better.<br/>I'd like to meet that guy someday.")
('Kwan', 'I would as well.')
('Kwan', 'Unfortunately, we have no idea where he went after<br/>that—or what his name is, for that matter.')
('Kwan', "I suppose we'll just have to let our imaginations fill in<br/>those blanks.")
('Agnès', "It's kind of sad that he's a nameless hero, but at least<br/>he isn't unsung.")
('Agnès', 'Anyway, thank you for guiding us—and for telling us<br/>those stories.')
('Van', "Yeah. They definitely weren't boring, I'll say<br/>that much.")
('Kwan', "I'm glad you were sufficiently entertained!")
('Kwan', "Now, as you head back, I want you to imagine that<br/>you're the young, courageous hero of the tale.")
('Kwan', "I'm sure things will look very different if you look at<br/>the surroundings through his eyes!")
('System', 'Quest Tour de Force completed!')
('System', 'Received')
('System', 'A fearsome foe is prowling around.')
('System', 'Found <br/>.')
('Feri', 'We did it!')
('Agnès', 'Phew... That was a tough one, but we came out<br/>on top.')
('Aaron', "We're burning a lot of daylight in this place.")
('Aaron', "But I guess it can't hurt to do a little warmup before<br/>the main event.")
('Van', "What's that over there?")
('Feri', "It's a stone monument and flowers.")
('Agnès', 'Wait...')
('Agnès', 'Are those the flowers the manager wanted us<br/>to find?')
('Agnès', "It's not every day you see flowers blooming in such a<br/>harsh environment.")
('Aaron', "Yep, that's the spring lily. No doubt about it.")
('Aaron', "Well, we might as well check them out since<br/>we're here.")
('Aaron', "Let's get a closer look.")
('Van', 'Okay.')
('Aaron', "There's actually a legend about flowers that grow in<br/>the Eroded Cave.")
('Van', 'Huh, neat.')
('Van', 'Wanna check them out?')
('Aaron', "There's actually a legend about flowers that grow in<br/>the Eroded Cave.")
('Aaron', "And unlike the whole Heilong Cheng Zhai thing<br/>that Heiyue spread, this tale's actually been around<br/>for a long time.")
('Van', 'Huh. Neat.')
('Van', 'Wanna check them out?')
('System', 'Quest Tour de Force 2 completed!')
('System', 'Received')
('Van', "Damn. Now that I'm looking at it up close, this stone<br/>monument doesn't look too shabby.")
('Agnès', "Look at all the pretty flowers. They're so<br/>mysterious—but gorgeous all the same!")
('Feri', 'This place has a solemn air about it.')
('Aaron', 'So it actually exists.')
('Aaron', 'I thought the legend was a load of bullshit, but I guess<br/>I was wrong.')
('Agnès', 'What legend?')
('Aaron', "If you really wanna know, look at the engravings on<br/>the monument. It'll do the explaining for me.")
('System', 'In honor of the hero who saved the city and fulfilled<br/>the wishes of those who fell in battle.')
('System', "May the souls of the valiant men and women who<br/>rose to protect their people rest in peace by the<br/>Heavenly Mother's side.")
('Van', "So it's both a commemorative monument and<br/>a cenotaph.")
('Van', "These flowers must've also been planted here to<br/>honor them.")
('Feri', 'Sounds like there was some kind of battle here.')
('Agnès', "Do you know if that's the case, Aaron?")
('Aaron', 'Yeah. There were some monsters running amok in<br/>this place a few decades ago.')
('Aaron', 'A powerful demonic monster made its home here and<br/>a bunch of smaller guys joined it.')
('Aaron', 'It used the wind to whip up a storm on the waters,<br/>which caused all kinds of accidents and disrupted the<br/>fishing business.')
('Aaron', 'Dozens of warriors came here to challenge it, but they<br/>were all slain.')
('Van', "And that's where the hero comes in, right?")
('Aaron', 'Yeah. After seeing the body count rack up, they<br/>decided enough was enough.')
('Aaron', 'Not only did he send that monster back the way it<br/>came from, he helped the city get back on its feet.')
('Aaron', 'This monument was built as thanks for all he did.')
('Van', 'That all matches up with what the tour guide told us.')
('Aaron', "Wait, you already knew the story? Why the hell<br/>didn't you guys stop me, then?")
('Agnès', 'I wanted to hear about it from your perspective.')
('Feri', 'So this place has a ton of historical significance, then!')
('Van', 'That was a neat little story.')
('Van', "Well, we should probably get these back to<br/>the client. Wanna grab a handful of 'em?")
('Aaron', 'Yeah, sure.')
('Agnès', "Oh, right. There's one more thing I'd like to ask.")
('Agnès', "What are these flowers exactly? I've never seen this<br/>kind before.")
('Aaron', 'These things are called spring lilies. They guide the<br/>souls of the dead all the way up to heaven, apparently.')
('Van', 'Huh.')
('Van', "Well, since we're right here, why don't we pick a few?")
('Aaron', 'What? Why?')
('Aaron', "Wait, maybe that's not such a bad idea. I can think<br/>of some guys who might be happy to get a few<br/>of them.")
('System', 'Obtained Spring Lilies!')
