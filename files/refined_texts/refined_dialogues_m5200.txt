('Shizuna', "I wasn't sure I could even perfect the zeroth form<br/>after being told to do it out of nowhere...")
('Shizuna', "...but I think I've earned the right to hold my head up<br/>high to Master's younger disciple now.")
('Shizuna', 'Not that I can see him joining us up on stage<br/>anytime soon.')
('Kurogane', 'All is ready, Princess.')
('Shizuna', 'In record time, too.')
('Shizuna', "We couldn't have asked for a bigger client, and this is<br/>the first long-term contract we've had in a while.")
('Shizuna', 'We can afford to take it easy for our first task,<br/>at least.')
('Shizuna', 'But the time has come to reaffirm our existence to<br/>the world. Tread lightly, for the Ikaruga lurk in<br/>the shadows.')
('Commander Geraint', "So she noticed us. I should have known we couldn't<br/>deceive the Divine Blade of Silver.")
('Commander Geraint', 'This is a reconnaissance in force mission. We only<br/>need assess their capabilities, not win the battle.')
('Commander Geraint', 'Our foes are both above S-rank in strength. Strike in<br/>the Blitz Halberd formation!')
(40452, 'Ja!')
('Bergard', '...?!')
('Bergard', "I'd planned to depart for the East after speaking<br/>with him...")
('Bergard', "How fortunate that I was able to catch a glimpse of<br/>the living legend's covert student before doing so.")
('Bergard', 'I cannot help but wonder what she fights for with<br/>those unusual talents of hers...')
('Bergard', "...but that mystery, along with what lurks here<br/>beneath the Kunlun Mountains under Calvard's<br/>stormy skies, will have to wait.")
('Bergard', 'Now is not the time to investigate further.')
('Bergard', '...Though it would be a shame to let this encounter<br/>go to waste.')
('Bergard', 'It might be worth pitting my own greenhorn student<br/>against her to see how he fares.')
('Shizuna', '...')
('Shizuna', 'An enemy attack? No...')
('Shizuna', '...')
('Shizuna', 'What do we have here? A paranormal being?')
('Shizuna', "Oh, but there's more at work here than that...")
('Quatre', 'So this way leads up into the mountains...')
('Feri', "It looks very scenic, but it's still littered<br/>with monsters.")
('Agnès', 'If Yumé really did come up here alone...')
('Aaron', "...then we've got no time for talking. Let's get a<br/>move on.")
('Risette', 'The police and the guild have promised to inform us<br/>if they learn of anything.')
('Van', "You're still all good with helping us with this, right?")
('Judith', 'Of course. If we ever need to split up to cover more<br/>ground, then the more people we have, the better.')
('Judith', 'I can pull my weight in battle if we run up against any<br/>tough monsters, too.')
('Judith', "Heck, even if it takes me getting into costume again,<br/>that's what I'll do!")
('Van', "Then we're countin' on you.")
('Aaron', "Heh. Can't wait to see this ten up close.")
('Judith', 'C-Can you not look at me with those<br/>lust-filled eyes?!')
('Feri', "Let's get moving!")
('Agnès', "We're counting on FIO and XEROS' support, too!")
('Quatre', "Set your sensor sensitivity to maximum!<br/>Following Yumé's trail is top priority!")
('FIO', 'Understood!')
('XEROS', 'RUFF!')
('System', 'Judith joined the party once more.')
('Feri', "That's the last of them. But...")
('Quatre', "Try and stay calm. We've only just started searching.")
('Risette', "Still, there's evidence on the ground that she has been<br/>this way.")
('Aaron', 'Yeah. We got a bunch of tiny footprints making their<br/>way up the mountain.')
('Agnès', '...! R-Really?!')
('XEROS', 'GRR... RUFF!')
('FIO', 'Affirmative. These footprints are an exact match with<br/>those of Yumé. XEROS has also found her scent.')
('FIO', "She appears to be proceeding up the mountain in a<br/>'skipping' state.")
('Judith', "Y-You even know when she's skipping?")
('Van', "But why? This just keeps makin' less and less sense...")
('Agnès', 'It figures this would react now.')
('Feri', 'Do you think that relates to Yumé in some way?')
('Van', "Think it's more to do with this issue, to be honest.")
('Van', "Feels like we're gettin' closer by the minute.")
('Quatre', 'Hmm...')
('Aaron', 'So that and our kiddo acting weird could be<br/>related, huh?')
('Risette', "Indeed...<br/>(Could this involve the Xipha's resonance in<br/>some way...?)")
('Arioch', '...')
('Judith', "Y-You've kinda lost me, but this means we're going<br/>in the right direction, right?")
('Judith', "Then there's no time to waste!")
('Van', "Yeah. You're right.")
('Agnès', "Let's keep going!")
('Feri', 'Oh! There she is!')
('Agnès', 'Thank goodness!')
('Quatre', 'She looks unharmed, too. What a relief.')
('Judith', "She has no idea just how worried she's had us...<br/>Hmm?")
('Risette', 'That certainly looks like her, but...')
('Aaron', "Something's not right.")
('Van', '...')
('Yumé', 'La la laaa...')
('Yumé', "I'm starting to get used to this body. We must have a<br/>high affinity after all.")
('Yumé', "Hmm... Perhaps she's...")
('Van', 'Stop right there!')
('Yumé', 'Oh! So this time you came to me instead of<br/>me coming to you, huh?')
('Feri', 'Yumé...?')
('Agnès', 'No, something about what she said makes<br/>me think...')
('Quatre', '...?!')
('Aaron', 'My bad feeling was right on the mark, huh?')
('Van', "It's you, isn't it? Mare?")
('Yumé', 'Heehee... Heeheehee...')
('Yumé', "It sure is! I'd be more surprised if you didn't figure it<br/>out after I left THAT many clues.")
('Yumé', "That's right! It's me, Mare! I'm just borrowing this<br/>little one's body for a while.")
('Yumé', "This is my first time trying something like this, so I<br/>wasn't sure it was going to work...")
('Yumé', '...but we seem to be a perfect match for each other, so<br/>I can move however I want!')
('Feri', '...')
('Judith', "Y-You're haunting her? Or more like you<br/>POSSESSED her?!")
('Quatre', "So it seems... I don't know how this is even possible,<br/>but we can't deny what's in front of our eyes.")
('Quatre', "All I can guess is that she performed a kind of<br/>biological hacking using the Xipha's<br/>resonance feature.")
('Aaron', 'What the...? Is that even possible?')
('Risette', "I wouldn't rule the possibility out.")
('Risette', 'Still, much like the Grendel, it would rely on<br/>technology far beyond what we currently have.')
('Agnès', "Right...<br/>(And I'm guessing it was made possible by...)")
('Van', 'Well, we can have this conversation later. Right now,<br/>you need to give Yumes her body back.')
('Van', 'You belong in here.')
('Yumé', "I mean, I COULD do that...but you don't need to be<br/>so bossy about it.")
('Yumé', "This is my first time getting to experience the<br/>real world! What's wrong with me having a little fun?")
('Yumé', "I bet that maid over there understands how I'm<br/>feeling better than the rest of you.")
('Risette', 'Certainly, I...')
('Feri', 'Risette...')
('Agnès', '...')
('Judith', 'Either way, regardless of HOW you did it, let me get<br/>this straight.')
('Judith', "The fairy thing I saw in the hotel's taken control of<br/>that girl's body, right?")
('Judith', "It's all very well and good that YOU'RE having fun,<br/>but you shouldn't be having it if it's causing trouble<br/>for other people.")
('Judith', 'So unless you want a good spanking, you give that<br/>body back right now.')
('Agnès', 'Judith...')
('Feri', "Y-Yeah! She's right!")
('Yumé', "And what're you going to do if I say no?")
('Judith', "If that's how you want to play...I'll MAKE<br/>you give it back!")
('Yumé', "Ahaha! I knew you'd do that!")
('Judith', 'What the—?!')
('Aaron', 'Come on...!')
('Van', "Tch. Figures she'd be able to use shards like a pro.")
('Quatre', "Right—because she's able to rely on Van's Xipha and<br/>a Genesis...")
('Risette', 'Given how she is able to control the Grendel, she<br/>may be more proficient with shards than even I am!')
('Yumé', "Heehee. I've always wanted to try playing tag, or<br/>whatever you call it.")
('Yumé', 'Here, kitty, kitty! Catch me if you can!')
('Judith', "And where do you think YOU'RE going?!")
('Feri', "We've got to go after them!")
('Van', 'Right! Agnès, Quatre, you two follow on after us!')
('Quatre', 'R-Right!')
('Agnès', 'P-Please, do what you can for Yumé!')
('Aaron', 'Heh! The chase is on!')
('Agnès', "I-I can't believe it's possible to use shards with that<br/>level of skill...")
('Quatre', "*pant* It's not for normal people... No normal<br/>human's capable of that!")
('Quatre', 'Ugh. At this rate... XEROS!')
('XEROS', 'RUFF!')
('Quatre', "Climb up behind me! You're light enough that it<br/>won't slow us down!")
('Agnès', '...! Okay!')
('Judith', "Ugh...<br/>(I can barely keep up when she isn't using any muscle<br/>strength at all.)")
('Judith', "THAT'S ENOUGH. MESSING.<br/>AROOOUND!")
('Yumé', 'Ack!')
('Feri', "We've got her!")
('Aaron', "Game's up, kiddo!")
('Yumé', 'Ugh...')
('Risette', "You've played for long enough.")
('Yumé', 'Mmgh...')
('Judith', '*pant* Finally got you!')
('Yumé', 'Grr! Come on! Five against one is no fair!')
('Yumé', 'Respect the rules of the game!')
('Aaron', 'We never...signed up for your stupid<br/>game in the first place!')
('Feri', "N-Now give Yumé's body back! Please!")
('Van', "No! That one's a fake!")
('Judith', 'Oh, crud!')
('Risette', 'How could she make replica with shards that feels the<br/>same as the real thing?!')
('Yumé', "And that's a point for you, Van! The game's not<br/>over yet!")
('Van', 'Damn it! Give this shit up, already!')
('Quatre', "W-We still haven't caught her!")
('Agnès', 'Yumé—well, Mare! Please, just stop and listen to us!')
('Feri', 'Ugh...')
('Aaron', "All right—if that's how you wanna play it!")
('Judith', "And I just canceled my transformation, too...<br/>Fine! Then I'll do it without!")
('Yumé', "Boy, this is tons more fun than I thought it'd be! ♪")
('Yumé', 'That economic activity called shopping was fun,<br/>too—even if it was a bit primitive.')
('Yumé', 'Dining to sustain your vital functions is probably my<br/>favorite part so far, though.')
('Yumé', '...Still, I guess I should probably give this body back<br/>and go back to how things were before.')
('Yumé', 'Oh! But before that, I was really curious about that<br/>thing—')
('Shizuna', 'Yeah? Curious about what thing?')
('Yumé', '...?!')
('Shizuna', 'So you are some kind of spirit.')
('Yumé', 'N-No human can move like that!')
('Shizuna', 'That you knew of, but this one can.')
('Shizuna', "You're an intriguing little possessor. Is your host a<br/>customer at the springs, then?")
('Shizuna', "So...just what is it that's caught your interest<br/>up ahead?")
('Yumé', '...?!')
('Van', "That's enough of that!")
('Agnès', 'Wh-Who is she...?')
('Quatre', "I-I don't know, but we owe her one for finally<br/>catching her.")
('Feri', '...')
('Aaron', 'Damn...')
('Judith', "Phew... So? Who are you? That's some outfit<br/>you're wearing...")
('Shizuna', 'Heh. Rich to comment on my clothes considering<br/>how you were dressed earlier.')
('Van', 'A tachi wielder, huh?')
('Shizuna', "Taking a not-so-wild stab in the dark here: you're this<br/>child's guardian of sorts?")
('Shizuna', "I'm not going to hurt her. You're more than welcome<br/>to take her home with you.")
('Shizuna', "I'd be happy to perform an exorcism here and now if<br/>you want me to, too.")
('Shizuna', "You see, that's another of one my specialties.")
('Yumé', 'Eeek!')
('Agnès', 'W-Wait, please!')
('Feri', "Don't you do anything to her.")
('Van', "We're fine, thanks. She's gonna need tellin' off, but<br/>we can handle that ourselves.")
('Van', "You're no ordinary chick, are you?")
('Aaron', "Hell, I get the feeling she's a monster<br/>among monsters.")
('Risette', 'Her Eastern tachi and cutting-edge fortified suit<br/>certainly suggest as much.')
('Shizuna', 'Hmm... I think I like you people.')
('Yumé', 'Oof!')
('Shizuna', "I know work can't always be fun, but I was getting<br/>real bored up here.")
('Shizuna', 'What do you say to a little sparring match<br/>against me?')
('Shizuna', 'Oh, and you can all come at me at once—seriously,<br/>go for it.')
('Van', '...')
('Aaron', 'Heh... Sounds like fun to me.')
('Feri', 'Agnès, can you look after Yumé?')
('Agnès', '...All right.')
('Van', 'Great...')
('Van', "To keep it simple: I'm a spriggan, and these are my<br/>employees from Arkride Solutions over in the capital.")
('Van', "I get the feelin' I've heard rumors about you already...<br/>but how about you introduce yourself?")
('Shizuna', "Sure. I don't see a problem with that.")
('Shizuna', "To also keep it simple: my name is Shizuna Rem<br/>Misurugi, and I'm second-in-command of Ikaruga.")
('Shizuna', "I'm also part of the Black God One Blade school.<br/>So, you all ready for a fight?")
('Risette', 'As I feared!')
('Quatre', "W-Wait a second! I don't even know what's<br/>happening anymore!")
('Judith', "I-I'm lost. What's this about an Ikaruga and a Black<br/>God now?")
('Feri', '...I heard about them back home!')
('Aaron', "Heh, I've never heard of Black God, but that doesn't<br/>mean this is the first I've heard of a One<br/>Blade school!")
('Van', 'There are countless jaegers competing in the<br/>wastelands of the East.')
('Van', "But there's one group known to stand above all of<br/>the rest.")
('Van', 'Ikaruga, a SSS-level jaeger corps led by the Divine<br/>Blade of Silver!')
('Shizuna', "Heh. Well, you've got the spirit. Now to see if you've<br/>got the strength!")
('Aaron', 'Hahaha! Holy hell!')
('Feri', 'If we can just keep hanging in there...')
('Quatre', "Wha...?! I think I'm at my limit here!")
('Shizuna', "Good, good. I'm genuinely impressed.")
('Shizuna', "I know my master warned me otherwise, but I'd be<br/>remiss as a Divine Blade if I didn't pay respect to<br/>your strength.")
('Shizuna', 'Ohhhhh...')
('Van', 'Crap...')
('Shizuna', 'Spirit Unification!')
('Feri', '...!')
('Risette', "Th-That's the famous...")
('Aaron', "That's the master technique used by that new Divine<br/>Blade from the Empire?!")
('Shizuna', "Oh, you know him? He's started aiming to perfect his<br/>own potential, I believe.")
('Shizuna', 'This is just my best attempt at replicating<br/>his technique.')
('Shizuna', 'Still, I do find it pretty comfortable to use. Now, will<br/>this be enough to get you to start going for broke?')
('Van', '...?!')
('Agnès', "Sh-She can't...")
('Yumé', 'Wh-What IS this woman?')
('Van', "(That's gotta be the Unclouded Eye lettin' her see<br/>things for what they truly are.)")
('Shizuna', "Oho. I'm surprised you've heard of it.")
('Van', 'Get outta my head!')
('Aaron', 'Bah...')
('Quatre', 'D-Do we even stand a chance?')
('Judith', 'Ugh. I cannot believe you people...')
('Shizuna', '...?')
('Agnès', 'Wh-What are you doing?')
('Judith', 'GET A GRIP, ALREADY!')
('Judith', "Have you forgotten why we're even here?!")
('Judith', 'Our top priority is rescuing Yumé!')
('Judith', "And since she's probably exhausted from having her<br/>body borrowed since last night, she needs to rest!")
('Feri', 'Oh!')
('Risette', '...A valid point.')
('Judith', 'And you! I got a bone to pick with you!')
('Judith', "You might be really strong and perceptive, but if<br/>you're not out to kill us, maybe try reading the room<br/>before our minds!")
('Judith', "'Divine Blade'? That's sure an awesome-sounding<br/>title that you're totally not living up to right now.")
('Shizuna', '...Well, you got me there.')
('Agnès', 'Oh!')
('Van', '...')
('Shizuna', "I'd written you off as some strange woman with<br/>some wackadoo fashion sense, but you really hit<br/>the nail on the head.")
('Shizuna', "That's some presence. Do you make a living on the<br/>stage or something?")
('Judith', 'Well, it just so happens that I do—and who the hell<br/>are you calling strange with a wackadoo<br/>fashion sense?!')
('Feri', 'Umm...')
('Aaron', 'Are we good to wrap this up now?')
('Van', "Looks like we're done fightin' either way.")
('Van', "We only came here for a few days of R&R, so we're<br/>off to the capital tomorrow.")
('Van', "That means we don't care about you and your guys—<br/>or what you're doing in the middle of the mountains.")
('Shizuna', "Sounds like we're in a good place, then.")
('Shizuna', "We're not here to fight against tourists from Longlai.")
('Shizuna', 'Our enemies are intruders who violate the soil of the<br/>Kunlun Mountains with ill intent.')
('Shizuna', 'Like our friend over there, for instance.')
('Van', '...?!')
('Arioch', "Damn. Didn't think anyone would notice me.")
('Arioch', "I was gonna murder you all if the opportunity came<br/>knockin', but I guess it's not coming.")
('Feri', '...?!<br/>(What a murderous aura...)')
('Risette', "That isn't a shard camouflage!")
('Quatre', 'Aaahh!')
('XEROS', 'GRR...')
('Aaron', 'Not good...')
('Arioch', "Easy, now. I ain't lookin' for a fight.")
('Arioch', "I'll admit, I would've taken an opening if I saw one,<br/>but I got to see a hell of a fight, so I'd say<br/>I'm satisfied.")
('Arioch', "Heh. Almost can't wait until we meet next.")
('Shizuna', 'Oh? That halberd and armor of yours are clearly<br/>something special.')
('Van', "Yeah. I was thinkin' they're bound to be artifacts.")
('Aaron', "You son of a bitch. You're one of them, aren't you?")
('Feri', 'W-Wait... Are you one of the people who<br/>attacked Aida?!')
('Arioch', 'Man—that Flameeater was a fine woman.<br/>Real shame she got snuffed out like that.')
('Arioch', "I'm the overseer of the Garden of Rust, Arioch<br/>the Eradicator.")
('Arioch', "I'm also workin' with Almata's Dantès right now, as<br/>I'm sure you already caught on to.")
('Arioch', 'I hear you guys took REAL good care of Melchior<br/>and Olympia, huh?')
('Yumé', 'Eek...')
('Quatre', 'Wh-Why are you smiling at us like that?!')
('Arioch', "C'mon. I already said the fight can wait until<br/>next time.")
('Arioch', 'Especially since it looks like we got ourselves a few<br/>more guests.')
('Shizuna', "Heehee. They're finally back.")
('Risette', "It's the other warriors of Ikaruga...")
('Aaron', 'A real gathering of powerhouses.')
('Arioch', "You're all from the Rougetsu school, yeah? Nice of<br/>you to drop by.")
('Arioch', "Well, time to get goin'. See you around, spriggan—<br/>and you, too, Silverblade.")
('Arioch', "Like I said, the real fun'll begin at our next<br/>play date...")
('Arioch', 'In a joyous carnival of blood and violence the likes of<br/>which the world has never seen.')
('Aaron', 'Wait a damn second!')
('Arioch', "Oh, before I go. I heard you spittin' fire earlier, and it<br/>was enough to make me hesitate on killin' you all.")
('Judith', '...?!')
('Arioch', "Heh. Crossing fingers you'll take part in the<br/>carnival, too.")
('Shizuna', "Well, that's not a kind of teleportation I'm used<br/>to seeing.")
('Kurogane', 'I would assume he used the power of his artifacts—<br/>which I suspect are...')
('Shizuna', 'Yeah. He might just be the one we were<br/>warned about.')
('Judith', 'Ugh. I could really do without fans like him...')
('Quatre', "I'm sure...")
('Van', "Okay. Looks like we really are done with fightin'<br/>for today.")
('Van', "And not a moment too soon—I'm about to crash.<br/>So if you could hurry up and get the hell outta here,<br/>that'd be great.")
(40451, 'Such impudence.')
(40452, 'No one speaks to our princess—')
('Shizuna', 'Sure thing, Mr. Arkride.')
('Shizuna', 'Or is it fine if I call you Van?')
('Van', '...I mean, if you want.')
('Shizuna', 'Excellent. It was nice meeting the rest of you, too.')
('Shizuna', 'Well, then, until next time. Hope you enjoy the rest<br/>of your stay.')
('Kurogane', 'The monsters on your path back have been slain and<br/>will not bother you. Farewell.')
('Feri', 'Umm...')
('Aaron', "I can't even bring myself to comment...")
('Risette', 'Regardless, now we can finally get to what we came<br/>here for.')
('Yumé', 'Uhh... I... Okay! Okay, I get it!')
('Yumé', "I'm sorry, okay? This was all my fault!")
('Yumé', "It's all because of me you almost had to fight a bunch<br/>of really dangerous people!")
('Yumé', 'I almost put this little one in danger, too...')
('Quatre', "Look who's being so sincere all of a sudden.")
('Feri', "Though I think she's done too much to get away with<br/>just a 'sorry'...")
('Agnès', "We're not even the ones you need to apologize to.")
('Agnès', "That said, we can tell that you didn't deliberately<br/>set out to cause trouble.")
('Agnès', "You just wanted to know more about the world and<br/>did it without thinking, didn't you?")
('Yumé', 'W-Well...')
('Yumé', '...')
('Feri', '...')
('Aaron', 'Heh.')
('Judith', 'I see now.')
('Agnès', 'Heehee. Still, try not to forget the trouble that you<br/>caused Yumé.')
('Agnès', '...That works for you, too, right, Van?')
('Van', 'Sure does.')
('Van', "Oh, and don't just up and ditch my Xipha<br/>outta nowhere. I had to use another holo, y'know.")
('Yumé', "H-How could you do that?! I'm the only one allowed<br/>to—")
('Yumé', "...Oh, who am I kidding? I can't complain when it<br/>was my fault.")
('Yumé', 'Ugh, fine! I get it! I know!')
('Yumé', "I'll give this body back now. Just tell her sorry for me<br/>when you get a chance!")
('Feri', '...')
('Agnès', 'Mare...')
('Quatre', 'It really does seem like she used the Resonance<br/>Phenomenon in some way...')
('Risette', "But considering she was able to operate Yumé's body<br/>remotely, she must be using orbal waves...or septium<br/>veins, even?")
('Van', 'Oh—one last thing before you go.')
('Van', "We get that you wanted to try a bunch of different<br/>things...but why'd you come all the way up here?")
('Yumé', 'Oh. Right...')
('Yumé', "It's because further up the mountains I<br/>sensed ㌍㌫㌻㍊㌫㌻㍊㍍.")
('Yumé', 'That might be something to keep in mind<br/>going forward.')
('Yumé', 'Maybe after the activation of ㌍㌫㌻㍊㌫㌻㍊㍍...')
('Yumé', 'Rebooting holo system. Holo MK-ESV004 Mare has<br/>been restored.')
('Aaron', 'Just had to tease us one last time before she went<br/>back, huh?')
('Agnès', "I don't understand why we couldn't hear some of<br/>what she was saying...")
('Judith', 'Yeah. What was that about? That really threw me for<br/>a loop!')
('Quatre', 'We know no more than you do, unfortunately.')
('Yumé', 'Mmm...')
('Agnès', 'Oh!')
('Feri', 'Yumé!')
('Yumé', '*yaaawn* Oh! Morning, everybody!')
('Aaron', 'You feeling pooped at all, kiddo?')
('Feri', 'O-Or hungry? Do you hurt anywhere?')
('Yumé', 'Mmm... Nope. I feel fine... Wait. But why are<br/>we outside?!')
('Yumé', "Woooow! It's so pretty out here!")
('Yumé', 'Oh! XEROS and FIO are here, too!')
('XEROS', 'RUFF!')
('FIO', 'Good morning, Yumé.')
('Agnès', 'Ahaha... Well, shall we get back to Longlai?')
('Risette', 'That sounds like a plan to me. We should make sure<br/>everyone knows we found her first thing.')
('Quatre', 'And I should probably update my database with all<br/>this new information.')
('Judith', 'Never a dull moment for you, huh?')
('Van', 'Maybe, but that goes for you, too.')
('Van', "Thanks for all the help. I'll make it up to<br/>you sometime.")
('Shizuna', 'Zeroth Form: Duality.')
('Shizuna', "Phew. Thank goodness—looks like I'm in good<br/>form tonight.")
