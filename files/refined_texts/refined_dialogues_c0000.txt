('Agnès', 'I had a lot of fun checking in on the other<br/>students earlier. The city is so alive today!')
('Agnès', "Of course, I'm here to help you and everyone else<br/>with any work that comes up, too.")
('Agnès', "If you need to bring me in, that's okay. Just come talk<br/>to me anytime.")
('Van', "Got'cha. Will do. Thanks for being so<br/>flexible, Agnès.")
('Van', 'So this is where you snuck off to?')
('Agnès', 'Yes. I had a quick errand to attend to.')
('Agnès', 'Are all your preparations squared away?')
('Van', "Preparations? Uh, heh... Feels like a bit of a stretch to<br/>call 'em that, but yeah. I'm ready.")
('Van', 'We still got plenty of time, so no need to rush.')
('Agnès', "Well, there's rushing, and then there's being efficient.<br/>Heehee!")
('Van', "(Guess she's in the middle of somethin'... I'll bug her<br/>later after my stuff's done.)")
('Agnès', "It's quite lovely out today. The sun feels wonderful...")
('Agnès', "It's been some time since I last made the rounds.<br/>I think it's getting me excited!")
('Agnès', 'I was thinking of going over some old case files while<br/>I still have the chance.')
('Agnès', "If anyone contacts the office while I'm here, I'll<br/>forward them to you.")
('Agnès', 'Best of luck on your end!')
('Feri', "Ahh... I don't usually bathe during the day.<br/>It's kinda...luxurious!")
('Feri', "That felt really nice—I'm in tip-top shape now!<br/>If you need me for anything, lemme know!")
('Feri', "Oh, yeah. I got Fie's number before she left.")
('Feri', "We were talking about doing the rounds together<br/>during the festival. Guess I know what I'm doing for<br/>the day!")
('Feri', "It's kinda weird, heehee. We're not really friends, but<br/>we're more than acquaintances now.")
('Feri', 'She knows a lot about Aida, too, so I wanna get to<br/>know her better!')
('Feri', "It's made me think about what else I can do—besides<br/>just going back home and being a warrior...")
('Feri', "Mmm... I think I'm confusing myself about it.<br/>There are just so many options...")
('Feri', 'So I wanna take the time to really think it through.<br/>Thanks for all the help along the way, Van!')
('Feri', 'I think I might go out and gather some intel<br/>after this. Is that okay?')
('Feri', 'A always seems to be one step ahead of us...but I<br/>wanna get the jump on them this time!')
('Feri', 'Brr... How is it November already? It started<br/>getting really cold all of a sudden...')
('Van', "How about you head back inside, then? I don't do<br/>paid sick leave, so don't you go catchin' a cold on me.")
('Feri', 'Fiiine, heehee...')
('Feri', "I've just been thinking to myself a lot... My brother's<br/>words are floating around in my head.")
('Van', "That stuff about 'having what it takes'?")
('Feri', "Yeah... But I'm not gonna let it get me down.")
('Feri', 'I know I have the heart of a real Kruga warrior...<br/>Nothing anyone says can change that.')
('Feri', 'I just have to be strong enough that even my brother<br/>respects me.')
('Feri', "If I keep working hard and getting stronger, like I'm<br/>already doing, I'll be that full-fledged warrior.<br/>Just you watch!")
('Van', "That's the spirit, kiddo.")
('Van', "Ain't always bad to have a chip on your shoulder.<br/>Just don't go pushin' yourself too hard over it, yeah?")
('Feri', 'Mhm! Yeah.')
('Feri', 'Oh, what are FIO and Étoile up to?')
('Feri', "It's really neat seeing a drone and cat talking to<br/>each other.")
('Feri', "They're gonna flip back home when I write about it.<br/>Heehee!")
('Van', "Yo. Helpin' out in the kitchen today?")
('Feri', "Yup! Risette and Agnès handled the office work, so I<br/>figured I'd cover the kitchen.")
('Feri', "It's nice to learn more about Western-style cuisine<br/>while I'm at it!")
('Feri', 'Right now, they have me doing garnishes and stuff.<br/>Starting simple, of course.')
('Van', 'Quick learner, huh? Pops can be pretty strict about it,<br/>though, so be careful.')
('Feri', 'Well, I used to help Umi a lot back at home.')
('Feri', 'Though all I ever made was rations, feels like...')
('Feri', 'I wanna get good at Western cooking, so that I can<br/>go back home and make something really nice<br/>for everyone.')
('Feri', 'Thinking back, there was just so much new stuff I<br/>had to get used to when I came to the city...')
('Feri', "...but I think I've got my head wrapped around<br/>it now! Even the cooking is really cool!")
('Van', "'Sup? You writing a letter?")
('Feri', "Mhm! I figured I'd let everybody back home know<br/>how I'm doing.")
('Feri', "We've written back and forth a few times, but man,<br/>there's just so much to talk about now! I dunno where<br/>to start.")
('Feri', 'My first time in the Blacklight District, for one...<br/>though Abi might already know what that place<br/>is like.')
('Van', "Wouldn't surprise me. Might as well be on the jaeger<br/>bucket list.")
('Feri', "I might've gone there as a jaeger myself, if I'd<br/>stayed there.")
('Feri', 'But I like learning about stuff this way. Working with<br/>you has really opened my eyes to all these new things.')
('Feri', 'So I was, umm...I was gonna write to them about it.<br/>Every day out here is super exciting!')
('Van', "I say go for it. I can tell you've really liked the time.")
('Feri', "Just, I'm doing so much stuff now... I gotta pick<br/>something to write about, but what? Hmm...")
('Feri', "I wanna write to my little brother and sisters, but<br/>then, there's so much I wanna tell Umi!")
('Feri', 'Oookay, sooo...the expense reports go here, these<br/>papers go there...')
('Van', "You good there? Don't dive in over your head, or<br/>you'll just make a mess of things.")
('Feri', 'S-Sorry. This is just kinda tough...')
('Feri', "...but I wanna get good at the orbal net, so I'll keep<br/>working at it!")
('Feri', "So if at first I don't succeed, I'll try and try again!")
('Van', "Haha! I'm sure you'll have it down pat in no time.")
('Feri', 'Man...filing documents is way harder than it sounds.')
('Feri', 'But everyone else can do it, so I should learn it, too!<br/>Just gotta keep at it.')
('Feri', 'Whew... It rained on me a little, so I hopped in for a<br/>quick shower.')
('Feri', "I'm feeling way better now that I'm warmed up!")
('Van', '...Hold up. Fast? Shower?')
('Van', "Ferida, you're killin' me here. Quickies don't cut it<br/>for bathing. You gotta savor it, let it warm you up all<br/>the way through!")
('Van', "If you ain't got the time, then make some! Ideally at a<br/>bathhouse, but failing that, anything but<br/>an in-and-out.")
('Feri', '(Oh, right... Van gets really picky when it comes<br/>to baths.)')
('Van', "What's done is done, but make time for proper baths<br/>going forward, got it?")
('Feri', 'Y-Yes, sir!')
('Feri', "After this, I've got homework to do for tomorrow...")
('Feri', 'Agnès is busy today, so I have to figure this<br/>out myself.')
('Feri', "Hmm... I wonder if Aaron's good at this kinda thing?")
('Van', 'Beats me. Why not ask him yourself?')
('Feri', "Good idea! Maybe he's really smart!")
('Van', "(Pfft. I know she ain't TRYING to diss him, but...)")
('Feri', 'I wanna try finishing it all by myself first!')
('Feri', '*yaaawn* Oh, geez. I have to stay awake.')
('Feri', "I've been in the city for three whole weeks, now. I can<br/>handle errands just fine!")
('Feri', 'Right, so there are three brands here... The one I<br/>need is...')
('Feri', "I-I'm fine! I made sure to write it all down!")
('Feri', 'Oh, hi! Welcome to my room.')
('Van', "Yo. Haven't been in here since I helped you carry<br/>your stuff in.")
('Van', "Looks like you've settled in nicely.")
('Feri', 'Yeah, thanks to everyone helping me buy<br/>my groceries.')
('Feri', 'And the guys at Montmart were really kind. They let<br/>me borrow a bunch of their old furniture and stuff!')
('Van', "Wow. Ain't that nice?")
('Van', "Just lemme know if there's anything I can get'cha, or<br/>if you need help with whatever.")
('Feri', 'Uh-huh! Thank you so much!')
('Feri', "I still get a little homesick every now and then, but<br/>I'm having so much fun here!")
('Feri', "I'll have so much to tell everyone when I get<br/>back home. I wanna really rock their socks off!")
('Aaron', 'Ahh... Nothing beats kicking back and binging with<br/>the boys. But the thought of work is killing my buzz...')
('Aaron', 'Well, at the very least, doing the rounds lets me suss<br/>out a new watering hole or two.')
('Aaron', 'So I guess, just lemme know when you need me to do<br/>my sweep.')
('Van', 'Still drinking?')
('Aaron', "Hell yeah, I am. We've still got some of the booze<br/>from that Heiyue stash to work through.")
('Aaron', "And I think there's still some of that meat left from<br/>the party we had with the prince. That should still be<br/>plenty tasty leftover.")
('Van', "Huh. Nice... Man, that party really was somethin'<br/>else, thinkin' back on it.")
('Aaron', 'Tell me about it. Just a ragtag band of misfits having<br/>the time of their lives together.')
('Aaron', "But y'know, I don't mind parties like that. Me and<br/>the boys back in Langport, we lived to party and<br/>partied to live. Good times, those were.")
('Aaron', "What do you say? Wanna round up some folks for<br/>round two? C'mon, you've still got some youth left in<br/>you, right?")
('Van', "Yeah, no. I get'cha, but it ain't happenin'.")
('Aaron', "Well, fine, killjoy, have it your way. I'll just drink by<br/>my lonesome.")
('Aaron', "...But do I have to, though? I've got a lucky lady or<br/>two on the mind... Maybe I'll hit up my favorite joint.")
('Van', 'Well, whoever you bring over, you better not cause<br/>any trouble together, got it?')
('Aaron', 'Who died and made you my grandpa?')
('Aaron', 'Go read the kids a bedtime story or something.')
('Aaron', 'Just lemme do my thing, yeah? Got some booty calls I<br/>wanna make.')
('Aaron', 'I hit up some of my newer contacts to try and get<br/>a lead...')
('Aaron', "...but everywhere's kind of a mess right now.<br/>There's nothing concrete tipping us off to A's<br/>next move.")
('Aaron', "I dunno what they're planning next, but no way in<br/>Gehenna I'm letting them do it.")
('Aaron', 'I was dicking around with nothing to do when<br/>Paulette asked me to run an errand for her.')
('Aaron', "Didn't feel like it, but eh, there was something I<br/>wanted to grab, too. And it makes me look good,<br/>I guess.")
('Aaron', "Y'know, this place has a pretty good lineup. Color<br/>me impressed.")
('Aaron', "Maybe I'll pick up a little something for Syd now that<br/>he's better.")
('Aaron', 'Guy said he was gonna drop by for the festival.')
('Aaron', "Heh, he brings the rest of those jackoffs along and<br/>this place'll get real noisy, real fast.")
('Aaron', "Can you get grandpa over there to nix the daggers?<br/>Man's gonna give himself a stroke at this rate.")
('Aaron', "I figure we can talk some more once he's out<br/>of earshot.")
('Van', "Huh. Credit where it's due—you're actually pretty<br/>tidy in here.")
('Aaron', "Chicks dig a clean room. I got me my basic supplies,<br/>and that's all I need.")
('Aaron', "...Couldn't be bothered to open the rest of my<br/>boxes, though. Nothing in them, really.")
('Van', 'Uh-huh...')
('Van', "Well, you do you. It's your room. All I ask is you<br/>keep it clean.")
('Aaron', 'Works for me.')
('Aaron', 'Oh, yeah. Told a friend of mine back in Langport<br/>that I was gonna call him.')
('Aaron', "Still got the beer and munchies in the fridge?<br/>Heh, don't mind if I do.")
('Van', "Man, didn't you only just turn twenty? You drink way<br/>too much like a regular.")
('Van', 'Bet you could get the old man to throw a little party<br/>for you.')
('Aaron', 'Nah. I shot the shit over the net with my buddies<br/>back home. That was a good time.')
('Aaron', "Food here's pretty good, though. Maybe I'll bug the<br/>old man for a dinner.")
('Aaron', 'Nice that I get the corner. I can be as loud as I want<br/>without bugging the neighbors.')
('Aaron', "Think I'll help myself to the beer and snacks in the<br/>fridge later.")
('Van', 'Just keep yourself in check, yeah?')
('Van', "You got a lot of guts slackin' off on the clock, bud.")
('Aaron', "Oh, get off my back. I'll be done with my work by the<br/>time you get back.")
('Aaron', 'Oh, right. Almost forgot.')
('Aaron', "I hit twenty the other day, so don't toss that booze in<br/>the fridge, all right? I'll help myself.")
('Van', "Well, works for me. You're an adult.")
('Van', "Maybe you could ask the old man to throw a little<br/>somethin' for you.")
('Aaron', 'Nah. I shot the shit over the net with my buddies<br/>back home. That was a good time.')
('Aaron', "Food here's pretty good, though. Maybe I'll bug the<br/>old man for a dinner.")
('Aaron', "I know how to budget my time. I'll have this stuff<br/>done by EOD, promise.")
('Aaron', 'Oh, that reminds me—those cans I put in the fridge<br/>should be cold by now...')
('Van', "Save it for when you're off the clock! Can't work for<br/>shit when you're drunk.")
('Aaron', 'Fine, fine, geez.')
('Risette', 'The air at the meeting is quite amicable, as far as I<br/>can tell.')
('Risette', "The attendants, however, are rather adept<br/>at putting on appearances, so I suppose I<br/>shouldn't jump to any conclusions.")
('Risette', 'I will be keeping tabs on the situation until you<br/>require my assistance.')
('Risette', 'The office is bound to face heavy traffic on the day of<br/>the festival.')
('Risette', 'As such, I plan to organize our submission documents<br/>and perform other clerical work in advance.')
('Risette', 'Feel free to entrust me with this work and devote<br/>your attention elsewhere.')
('Risette', "I don't believe I've ever divulged how I spend my<br/>savings, in retrospect.")
('Risette', "I'm not sure what my job responsibilities will entail<br/>after next month's maintenance...")
('Risette', "...but I believe I'll continue to explore my<br/>transfer options. They do seem quite attractive.")
('Risette', "Marduk is continuing their efforts to decipher A's<br/>next move.")
('Risette', 'The company is also investigating Ikaruga, albeit<br/>with little success.')
('Risette', 'The situation does unnerve me...but I will continue to<br/>investigate to the best of my ability.')
('Risette', 'I freed up some of my time, so I thought I might help<br/>clean the kitchen.')
('Risette', "Were you discussing something with<br/>Montmart's staff?")
('Van', "Yeah. Nothing bad, though. I plan on tellin'<br/>everyone tomorrow.")
('Risette', 'Well, I look forward to hearing the details, then.')
('Risette', 'I must say, these utensils and cutlery are very<br/>well kept. Montmart keeps itself wonderfully clean.')
('Risette', 'I will need to help maintain that spotless reputation.<br/>Heehee.')
('Risette', "I've finished filing the new documents, so I took the<br/>liberty of refactoring your computer in my spare time.")
('Risette', "The Kitty Engine was updated as well—I've installed<br/>the new revision for you.")
('Quatre', "The Kitty Engine...? I've never heard of that.<br/>What exactly is it?")
('Risette', 'It is an independent search engine that allows access<br/>to the Dark Web in a safe and<br/>controlled environment.')
('Risette', 'Its creator remains unknown—though with its name<br/>comes speculation that it was created by the infamous<br/>black-hat hacker, Kitty.')
('Van', "Does sound fishy, but I've used it a fair bit, and it<br/>works just as advertised.")
('Agnès', "Actually, I've used it before, too.<br/>Renne recommended it to me, if I recall.")
('Quatre', '...Huh. That would make a lot of sense, actually.')
('Quatre', 'Maybe I should give it a look later. Learning how<br/>to use that would be a valuable skill.')
('Risette', 'Rumors allege that Kitty was also involved in the<br/>creation of the social media aggregator that we use.')
('Risette', "It's proven quite useful, potential<br/>origins notwithstanding.")
('Risette', 'As always, I will collect and forward any relevant<br/>information I find.')
('Van', 'Is it just me, or did you bring back some more plants?')
('Risette', 'Indeed I did. I was perusing the flower shop in Old<br/>Town and happened upon some wonderful plants.')
('Risette', 'Are you off to patrol the city?')
('Risette', 'Do let me know if you need my assistance—I would<br/>be happy to help.')
('Van', "Thanks, but it ain't that big a deal, really.")
('Van', 'More like a late night walk than a patrol.')
('Van', "We got plenty to do tomorrow, so we'd best take it<br/>easy and rest up tonight.")
('Risette', 'Understood.')
('Risette', 'Perhaps I can do some reconnaissance preceding our<br/>trip to Basel, then.')
('Risette', 'Professional obligations notwithstanding, I do look<br/>forward to the trip.')
('Risette', 'Basel offers quite the array of scenery<br/>and architecture.')
('Risette', "It's not often I have the privilege of traveling both for<br/>business and for pleasure... Heehee.")
('Quatre', "The East's desertification is always a pretty heavy<br/>discussion topic, but everyone seems rather casual<br/>about it right now.")
('Quatre', "They built the foundation of this day and age<br/>themselves, so it stands to reason that they'd get<br/>along well.")
('Quatre', "I'm involved in the discussion as well, but if you need<br/>anything from me, don't hesitate to ask.")
('Quatre', "*sigh* Esmeray really can't handle her liquor.<br/>You'd think she'd STOP, but alas...")
('Quatre', 'Here, have some water. Geez... Can you get home by<br/>yourself, at least?')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'Heeeeeheehee... Of coursh! No proooblem!')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "But home, though? Naaah, I'm shtayin' at YOUR<br/>place, Quatre! ♪")
('Quatre', "Stop it, seriously! Van's here, too...!")
('Van', "No, I'm not.")
('Van', "I say let her crash at your place—better than tryin' to<br/>find a hotel.")
('Quatre', "That...really doesn't help.")
('Quatre', "Come on, Esmeray, you can walk! Let's move!")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "Hold me nishe and tighty, ammaybe I'll make it! Hic!")
('Quatre', "Aidios almighty, you're a handful sometimes...")
('Quatre', "I've heard that the orbal net is experiencing a lot more<br/>overhead with the festival nearing.")
('Quatre', "And on top of that, they've started testing for<br/>compliance with the new range protocols. That might<br/>be throttling the network a little, too.")
('Quatre', "I'll have to adjust our network settings so that our<br/>service doesn't get interrupted.")
('Quatre', "Oh, that reminds me... I found some weird lines in<br/>FIO and XEROS' activity logs. Evidently they started<br/>communicating with animals?")
('Quatre', "I never expected them to develop those kinds of<br/>routines, but I'm interested to see what comes of it.")
('Quatre', "I did want to mention: don't feel obligated to<br/>shoulder my workload.")
('Quatre', 'I appreciate it, but solving problems myself helps me<br/>learn more about the bigger picture. You never know<br/>when that knowledge base may come in handy.')
('Quatre', 'Knowing that my research can save people in the real<br/>world...it really puts my mind at ease.')
('Quatre', "I can't begin to imagine the grief running through<br/>their heads... It's difficult trying to face them at all.")
('Quatre', "...But I can't sit idly by and do nothing about it.<br/>I'll make what intelligence inroads I can.")
('Quatre', "I actually just finished analyzing Mare's data.")
('Quatre', 'Yang seemed quite interested in how holo cores<br/>worked as well.')
('Quatre', "I thought I had an idea of typical construction and<br/>assembly, but Mare's is a framework I've never<br/>seen before.")
('Van', 'Sorry to take up all your time with that. I really owe<br/>you one.')
('Quatre', 'Oh, no problem. Learning more about her and holo<br/>cores in general fascinates me. This project was well<br/>worth my time.')
('Quatre', "You're taking the nightly rounds again tonight?")
('Quatre', "You know, you're markedly different from how I<br/>imagined you'd be. You're more...serious, I suppose.")
('Van', "Nah. I just like waitin' till night to start<br/>screwin' around.")
('Van', "'Sides, night is when they show all the juicy shit in<br/>the theaters you can't see during the day.<br/>Heh...")
('Quatre', '...Aaand I take back what I just said.')
('Quatre', "At any rate, I should have Mare fully<br/>analyzed tonight. That's still right on schedule.")
('Quatre', "I'll have the report ready tomorrow morning.")
('FIO', 'Activating bodyguard mode, in case of<br/>unexpected events. Now scanning perimeter for<br/>suspicious persons.')
('FIO', 'FIO and XEROS shall protect the professor!')
('FIO', 'As a result of gross alcohol consumption, Esmeray<br/>cannot walk unassisted.')
('FIO', 'Probability of a hangover the following<br/>morning: 90%. FIO recommends drinking one liter of<br/>water tonight.')
('FIO', 'FIO shall assist. Activating support program.')
('FIO', 'FIO can now process five individual accounts within<br/>0.1 seconds, thanks to recent refactoring.')
('Van', "Well, damn. How're we supposed to compete<br/>with that?")
('FIO', 'You look satisfied, Quatre.')
('FIO', 'FIO shall assist you, Quatre.')
('FIO', 'High-sensitivity sensors deployed.')
('FIO', 'FIO will contact Quatre in the event of suspicious<br/>activity, or if persons of interest are detected.')
('Van', "You said somethin' about a bodyguard mode, right?<br/>That's pretty cool.")
('Quatre', "Indeed. With A's next move a mystery, I thought it<br/>best to err on the side of caution.")
('Van', "We don't know what A's gonna do next, so best to<br/>stay on our toes.")
('FIO', 'Suffered greater than expected time loss while<br/>collecting laundry.')
('FIO', "Now updating 'cat' database entry with metadata<br/>tag 'sensitive'...")
('Van', '...I mean, yeah. Cat sees some weird robot thing in its<br/>neighborhood, cat flips out.')
('Van', "But hey, maybe they'll get used to you.")
('Agnès', 'FIO? What are you doing here?')
('Van', "Oh, don't tell me...")
('FIO', "Currently executing Paulette's request to dry laundry.")
('FIO', 'Is the laundry satisfactorily dry?')
('Quatre', 'Hmm... Yup, this looks good. Thank you, FIO.')
('FIO', 'Aha, good. This mission log will be added to<br/>training datasets.')
('Feri', 'FIO really does it all!')
('Aaron', "Man, it's scary how capable that thing is. How'd it<br/>learn so much?")
('Risette', "FIO never ceases to amaze. I'm impressed.")
('FIO', 'Mission accomplished. Now reporting to Paulette.')
('FIO', 'XEROS is currently carrying out another<br/>mission outside.')
('XEROS', 'RUFF!')
('Van', 'Well, he sounds happy.')
('Van', "Maybe he's happy to see the professor again. Been a<br/>while, hasn't it?")
('XEROS', 'RUFF!')
('Van', 'Oho! You excited, boy?')
('Aaron', 'Still hyped up from the party, I imagine.')
('XEROS', 'WOOF...')
('XEROS', 'GRRRRR...')
('Van', "So what's he doing now, sleeping? Or a standby<br/>mode, I guess?")
('Van', 'Well, no point waking him up. Sleep tight.')
('XEROS', '*SNIFF* RUFF!')
('Judith', 'Huh? Is it keeping watch over the kids or something?')
('Quatre', 'Yeah, just in case. Good work, XEROS.')
('Van', "Yeah, Quatre programmed him to do that. Who's a<br/>good boy?")
('XEROS', 'RUFF!')
('XEROS', 'RUFF!')
('XEROS', 'RUFF!')
('XEROS', 'RUFF...')
('Quatre', 'Ah, XEROS is charging right now.')
('Van', "Huh. Could've fooled me. He looks like he's just<br/>sitting there.")
('XEROS', 'GRR... RUFF.')
('Van', 'Just along for the ride, is he?')
('Judith', "I told the press I'd be lying low for the time being,<br/>mainly with Nina and the others.")
('Judith', "But I think I'm gonna tag along with you today, so let<br/>me know if there's anything you need me for.")
('Van', 'So this is where you snuck off to, huh? You blend<br/>right in already.')
('Judith', "I gotta say, this place nails both the food and the vibe.<br/>I think it's growing on me!")
('Judith', "Oh, by the way, I heard the Edith Girls' Collection is<br/>the night of the festival.")
('Judith', "I've been scaling back my work ever since the festival,<br/>but the EGC is one stage I can't ditch. It's very near<br/>and dear to my heart.")
('Judith', 'I plan to at least give the opening remarks—oh, that<br/>reminds me, I need to pick out a dress!')
('Judith', "I'll still be around if you need me for<br/>anything, though. Just let me know!")
('Judith', "It'll give me some food for thought about my other<br/>job...though the whole aftershock thing does have me<br/>kind of anxious.")
('Judith', 'But uh, enough about me!')
('Judith', 'I get why you draw that line where you do.')
('Judith', "But the way I see it...or the way THEY see it, I think<br/>it's fine.")
('Bergard', 'I, too, am curious to see how this match ends.')
('Bergard', 'If things do get out of hand, I will step in and calm<br/>them down.')
('Bergard', "Go ahead and do the rounds—I'll handle the rest.")
('Bergard', 'Ahh, Van. Care to join us?')
('Van', "Nah, I'm good. I'd just drag you down.")
('Van', '(I knew the old guy enjoyed chess, but I never pegged<br/>Master the type.)')
('Bergard', 'I count myself lucky to have found so worthy<br/>an opponent.')
('Bergard', 'Now, then...what say you to this gambit?')
('Van', "Keepin' your bike in shape? Nice.")
('Bergard', 'Indeed. I had some free time on my hands, so I<br/>thought I might tune her up a little.')
('Bergard', "I've been meaning to test her out. Let me know the<br/>next time you need to go out, and I'll give you a ride.")
('Aaron', "Lucky son of a... You'd better lemme at her again<br/>some time, capisce?")
('Bergard', 'Heh. You would be more than welcome now that you<br/>have a license.')
('Feri', "(You know, Bergard's kinda...)")
('Agnès', '(Heehee. He has this way of keeping Aaron<br/>in check.)')
('Bergard', 'That takes care of the cleaning... I suppose I have the<br/>time for a quick ride.')
('Bergard', 'I do want to see your work done. If you need my help,<br/>you need only ask.')
('Bergard', "I have said my piece... All that's left is for you to look<br/>within yourself and make your decision.")
('Bergard', "Now, then... I'll need something to pass the time.<br/>Perhaps a bike magazine or two will help...")
('Bergard', "A special feature...? 'Heart-Pounding Courses with<br/>Heart-Stopping Views'? Color me intrigued...")
('Victor', "If you're back safely...then we can try and find Yumé<br/>and Paulette next!")
('Victor', "There's only one thing a crotchety old fool like me<br/>can do...")
('Victor', "...and that's believe in you! Get back here in one<br/>piece, you got me?!")
('Van', "That's the plan!")
('Feri', "We'll find them and bring them back, we promise!")
('Victor', "Get'cher stuff all set while you still can. Only got<br/>one chance!")
('Victor', 'Get back here in one piece, you got me?!')
('Victor', "It's spreading all over the city, now... What the hell is<br/>going on?")
('Victor', "I can't help worrying about them... Of course they're<br/>out at the festival right now...")
('Van', "Yumé and Paulette were at Vantail, yeah?<br/>(They were on that screen, weren't they?<br/>Coulda sworn...)")
('Van', 'I think we can leave them to Maxim. With his<br/>reflexes, they should be all right.')
('Victor', '...Fine. No point rushing in and making things worse.')
('Victor', "Now go and get Feri. We'll figure things out<br/>from there!")
('Van', "Got it. Y'all hold down the fort!")
('Victor', "Tch... I can't just sit around here, but everything's a<br/>mess right now. Walking out won't do me any good...")
('Victor', "Go and get Feri. We'll figure things out from there!")
('Victor', 'Gonna be busy as hell today, but I can tackle the<br/>morning on my own and go from there.')
('Victor', 'Gotta let Paulette and Yumé have the day<br/>to themselves! Gets me nice and motivated!')
('Victor', 'And as for HIM... He so much as lays a finger on<br/>Paulette, after what he did?')
('Victor', 'THE END.')
('Van', 'Place is packed today, huh, pops?')
('Van', "I know your back's been buggin' you. Don't push<br/>yourself, yeah?")
('Victor', 'And you can mind your own business, sonny.<br/>You gonna order something, or what?')
('Victor', "If you're looking for Paulette and Yumé, they should<br/>be over in Vantail.")
('Victor', 'Check in on them for me, yeah?')
('Victor', "Van, go sneak a look at how they're doing for me.")
('Van', "Oh, relax. I'm sure they're just fine.")
('Victor', 'Hmm... This might be the turning point of the<br/>whole match.')
('Victor', 'I can play it safe, or I can make a big push...')
('Victor', "The festival menu's always a big hit, but I can't<br/>get complacent. Gotta give it a hundred percent every<br/>year—no exceptions!")
('Victor', "Make sure you guys get back early. Need some folks<br/>to taste test some new dishes I'm working on.")
('Feri', "Really? Yay! I can't wait, your cooking is always<br/>so good!")
('Aaron', "That got your attention real fast, huh, small fry?<br/>Now me, I'm interested in the adult munchies—got<br/>anything that goes well with a cold one?")
('Victor', "You can find out when you DO YOUR JOB, you<br/>little brat! Quit slackin'!")
('Agnès', "(Haha... He does like to chew Aaron out, but<br/>something tells me he'll have some snacks for<br/>him anyway.)")
('Van', "(The gang's really settling in, aren't they?<br/>Aaron's already drinkin' the place dry...)")
('Victor', "Can't rest on my laurels here—there's always pressure<br/>to come up with new stuff.")
('Victor', "Make sure you get home early today. I've got some<br/>work-in-progress dishes I want you to taste test.")
('Victor', 'Listen up. No slacking off, got it?')
('Victor', 'About damn time you lot showed up.')
('Victor', "It's almost noon! Move your lazy asses!")
('Van', "(Yeah, he's not in a good mood... Guess I'll just head<br/>out and keep myself busy.)")
('Victor', "Hmph. I can't stand even talking about<br/>that sleazebag...")
('Victor', "...but I gotta look past him for now. I'll leave him<br/>for later.")
('Victor', "My sweet Paulette... Gah! That little weasel!<br/>He comes around here again, he's getting a face full<br/>of skillet!")
('Judith', 'Is he, uhh, okay there?')
('Agnès', "Well...let's just say it's a family affair.")
('Agnès', "(Judith doesn't know about that, does she...?)")
('Van', '(At this rate, only a matter of time before she<br/>finds out.)')
('Van', "(Oh, right. Didn't she get wrapped up with that<br/>Maxim guy?)")
('Van', "(Not surprised that she and her dad don't care<br/>for him.)")
('Aaron', '(Well, the whole thing got swept under the rug<br/>because of all the other stuff at the time.)')
('Aaron', '(And that article smelled like BS anyway.<br/>They probably figured out it was<br/>a misunderstanding.)')
('Quatre', '(It effectively got buried beneath all the other news<br/>from the incident.)')
('Quatre', '(Not to mention the article itself was<br/>quite...disingenuous. I imagine they took it with a<br/>grain of salt.)')
('Risette', '(The scandal itself was effectively buried during the<br/>greater incident.)')
('Risette', "(The article failed to provide evidence for its claims—<br/>I'm sure they saw its lack of credibility.)")
('Victor', 'Hmph. Bastard went home, did he?')
('Victor', "(There's no way...is there?)")
('Van', "(Not a good look he's wearing... Probably best to<br/>leave him be right now.)")
('Victor', "I did train at a restaurant, for the record—I'm not<br/>self taught. Just racked up a lot of experience over<br/>the years.")
('Victor', "I don't wanna force this on Paulette and<br/>Yumé, though.")
('Victor', "I figure I'll change it up when I retire, remodel it into<br/>something they might like more. A café, maybe...")
('Victor', "Consider this advance notice: when that time comes,<br/>I'm gonna need a certain slacker upstairs to pitch in.")
('Van', "You're really gonna try to stick that on my rent?")
('Victor', 'Harumph! Depends, of course.')
('Van', 'Have mercy on my wallet, I beg you...')
('Quatre', "(I didn't realize he actually had savings. Hopefully he<br/>can keep them...)")
('Agnès', '(Van is the type who lives for his hobbies. If his rent<br/>gets raised...)')
('Victor', 'Rgh! Ahh... Really killing me tonight.')
('Van', 'Your back again? You really oughta take a break.')
('Victor', "It isn't that—oof! Damn it, I hate this aging thing...")
('Victor', "Gah! Pull yourself together, Victor! Long as Yumé's<br/>still small enough to fit in my arms, I gotta keep this<br/>bistro going.")
('Van', "(Well, with an attitude like that, he's set for life.)")
('Victor', "Nights are getting colder, that's probably what it is.<br/>Makes my back act up.")
('Victor', "...But I can sleep when I'm dead. Gotta care for<br/>Yumé until she can take care of herself!")
('Van', 'You sure you got that much left in the tank?')
('Victor', "If you're looking for Yumé, she's out. She's on<br/>delivery duty, just for today.")
('Victor', 'She wanted to help out, so I got her to go deliver<br/>the lunches Paulette made.')
('Victor', "I just hope she doesn't trip, or get lost, or something...")
('Victor', 'Oh, but she was just sooo precious! ♪ Had her little<br/>basket and everything...')
('Van', 'Place is packed today, huh, pops?')
('Aaron', "...Word of advice, gramps: don't make that face<br/>in public.")
('Feri', "Ooh, Yumé's running errands? That's pretty exciting!")
('Victor', "If you see Yumé, make sure she doesn't get into<br/>trouble, got it?")
('Victor', "Any shady-looking fellow gets within ten arge, you<br/>knock 'em into next week for me.")
('Van', "Ehh, she'll be fine. You don't get guys like that<br/>around here much.")
('Victor', "Hmph. Never can be too careful. This place isn't like<br/>it used to be. Heard Messeldam's getting pretty<br/>sketchy, too... Something about terrorists.")
('Victor', "Been hearing stuff about 'keeping the outsiders out'<br/>and crap... Used to hear that a lot when I was<br/>young, too.")
('Victor', "Don't get today's youngsters falling for that BS,<br/>got it?")
('Van', "I know, I know. But you keep worryin' about 'em so<br/>much and all your hair's gonna fall out.")
('Victor', 'Harumph! Watch it, kid. Just be smart out there, you<br/>hear me?')
('Victor', "I've seen that slippery slope. People get caught up in<br/>some damned awful stuff.")
('Victor', "Hate crimes, demon cults, terrorists... Hmph.<br/>Can't help worryin' about the way things are going.")
('Victor', "Hey, Red. You make a move on Paulette again, and I<br/>find out about it? You're gone.")
('Aaron', "Oh, don't be such a prude. She's twenty-seven!<br/>This is the prime of her life, you get what I mean?")
('Aaron', "I've seen some real bombshells at my local haunts, and<br/>y'know, she'd fit right in. But I get her to myself and<br/>I think I'd make all three of us happy!")
('Victor', 'YOU ARE A DEAD MAN.')
('Van', "(As if dealing with just one of 'em wasn't<br/>bad enough... And here I thought they might find<br/>some common ground.)")
('Victor', 'You. Make yourself useful and keep Red over there in<br/>check, got it?')
('Victor', "I'm teaching that brat a lesson. He talks to<br/>her, he even LOOKS at her again, and<br/>I'm gonna—")
('Van', 'Yeah, yeah, I know. You could really stand to calm<br/>down a little, pops.')
('Agnès', "(Victor looks like he's about to explode...)")
('Feri', "(Hmm... Maybe I should leave. It's getting really<br/>rowdy in here.)")
('Victor', "That red-haired punk. Shot his shot while I<br/>wasn't looking...")
('Victor', "...but I'm gonna catch him next time, and<br/>when I do, his scrawny little ass is GRASS!<br/>You hear me?!")
('Victor', "What, you going out? Doesn't look like you're hitting<br/>the bathhouse.")
('Victor', 'Hmph, just come back quickly. Damned delinquents<br/>running around doing as they please...')
('Van', "Easy there. I won't be long—trust me.")
('Feri', 'Thank you so much for the lunch, Victor! It was<br/>delicious as always!')
('Victor', 'Heh heh. Glad you liked it, kiddo!')
('Victor', "Tonight I've got some Central Eastern seasoning I'm<br/>gonna use, so leave some room for dinner, all right?")
('Feri', "Oooh, sounds good! I can't wait!")
('Van', "Y'know, you really spoil Feri, don'tcha?")
('Victor', '...Huh? Hell are you on about?')
('Victor', "She's living in another country, her parents aren't<br/>around, she's never been here before... What kinda<br/>jackass WOULDN'T be nice to her?!")
('Victor', "If Yumé or Paulette were living like that, I...<br/>Oh, forget it! Come now, little lady, eat up!<br/>What'd you like?")
('Van', "(Heh. Big ol' papa bear.)")
('Agnès', "(He's not so bad of a landlord, now, is he?)")
('Victor', "I've got plenty of good eats for you, so you ever get<br/>hungry, just lemme know.")
('Victor', "And this is just the dad in me talking, but don't worry<br/>your folks at home, all right?")
('Victor', "Make sure to write them every now and then.<br/>They wanna know what their little girl's up to.")
('Feri', 'Heehee! Will do!')
('Victor', 'Hmph. Heading out again?')
('Victor', "As your landlord, I can't help taking notice.")
('Victor', "I won't ask what you're doing—just be smart out<br/>there, you get me?")
('Agnès', 'Of course. Thank you for your concern.')
('Agnès', "Don't worry about me, though. I know what I need<br/>to do.")
('Victor', 'Good answer.')
('Victor', "Van, she comes back with so much as a scratch on her<br/>and I'm personally burying you. Mark my words.")
('Van', "All right, I get it! Don't pop a blood vessel.")
('Victor', "Hmph. I wouldn't worry about her if you didn't<br/>gimme a reason to.")
('Victor', "Anyhow, you've been eating properly, right?")
('Van', 'More or less. Sometimes Yumé dumps the leftover<br/>veggies on me.')
('Van', 'And I do cook for myself a lot.')
('Agnès', "Really? I didn't realize you could cook!")
('Van', '...Why is that surprising?')
('Van', "I make a mean sweet omelet, I'll have you know.")
('Agnès', 'Sweet...omelet?')
('Victor', 'Still rotting your teeth with that stuff, eh?')
('Victor', 'Here, make some better stuff.')
('System', 'Obtained Ingredient Set.')
('Van', 'Oh, thanks.')
('Agnès', "Are you sure it's okay to give us so much?")
('Victor', "They're just leftovers from this morning, no worries.")
('Victor', 'You get hungry, whip something up for yourselves.')
('System', "The office's kitchen is now available for cooking.")
('System', 'The Achievements section of the main menu is<br/>now unlocked.')
('Victor', "You can ask Paulette, she'll make something nice<br/>for you...")
('Victor', "...but don't slack on cooking for yourself, got it?")
('Victor', "And don't you dare slack on the job, either.")
('Victor', 'Damn kids today...')
('Victor', "Listen up. You know where the bad neighborhoods<br/>are—you'd better not be taking her to them.")
('Victor', 'You cause any problems and I BECOME the<br/>problem, you hear me?')
('Agnès', "(Aww, heehee. He's got a heart of gold beneath<br/>that exterior.)")
('Van', "(Pretty good chef, too. Just ask him if you're hungry<br/>and he'll whip somethin' up for you.)")
('Victor', "Well, I'll be damned... I knew you were<br/>hiding something. You're pretty good.")
('Victor', "I used to be top eight in amateurs, and you've got me<br/>on the back foot... It's been a while since I had a<br/>match this good.")
('Bergard', "Don't sell yourself short, Sir Victor. You would put<br/>many a knight to shame.")
('Bergard', 'You may even be able to hold your ground against<br/>the commander.')
('Victor', "Really, now? I'd love to sit down with them some day.")
('Van', '(Just how high is he rated?!)')
('Van', "(...Well, at least they're havin' a good time.)")
('System', ' has been added to the menu.')
('Victor', "Damn it all... Why? Why'd this have to happen...?")
('Paulette', 'I saw Hans just the other day... He always came down<br/>to sell their vegetables...')
('Paulette', 'Annie would always stop by to eat... Sister<br/>Belicia, too...')
('Feri', '...')
('Agnès', "(That's right... They sourced their vegetables from<br/>Creil Village...)")
('Judith', '(I had no idea...)')
('Van', "(Yeah... This place was a popular spot for 'em<br/>whenever they'd stop by.)")
('Victor', "You're heading out to work already...?")
('Paulette', "With the state of emergency, it's gotten quite chaotic<br/>out there... Will you be all right?")
('Van', "Should be. They're restricting the roads in and out of<br/>the city, but we're already inside, so we're just sorta<br/>stuck here.")
('Van', "Might as well get some work done while we're here—<br/>Aidios knows there's gonna be plenty of requests<br/>comin' in.")
('Paulette', 'I see... Just, please be careful out there.')
('Paulette', "Yumé and I were awfully worried about you...but we<br/>weren't the only ones.")
('Paulette', 'In truth, Dad was worried sick, too.')
('Van', 'Damn. Was he, now?')
('Agnès', 'I knew he had a heart of gold.')
('Victor', "Hmph. I'm not heartless. Once I knew Yumé was<br/>okay, I started wondering about you. Nothin' to it.")
('Victor', '...Just be smart out there, like I always say.<br/>Now especially...yeah?')
('Victor', "Don't let that writer's work go to waste.")
('Van', "...Yeah. I'll make sure of it.")
('Judith', '(Dingo was a regular here, too?)')
('Agnès', '(Yes. He and Van would frequent this<br/>place together.)')
('Agnès', "(He had only just eaten here for<br/>Marielle's celebration...)")
('Judith', '(Oh...)')
('Aaron', "(...Rotten pieces of shit, all of 'em.)")
('Quatre', '(How could they have done this...? Why...?)')
('Risette', "(...I'm lost for words. This situation just has<br/>no compare...)")
('Maxim', 'Thank you, Paulette. Truly. I really had a great time.')
('Paulette', "Well, I'm glad you enjoyed yourself, even if the food<br/>wasn't mine.")
('Maxim', "I-Is that so?! That's, uh, too bad, haha! I would've<br/>loved some of your cooking...")
('Maxim', 'Ahem! S-So, umm...')
('Maxim', 'A-About the festival!')
('Maxim', 'I mean, umm... Do you wanna, maybe, go with me?<br/>W-With Yumé, too, of course!')
('Maxim', 'M-May I have this date?!')
('Paulette', "...I'm afraid I can't, sorry.")
('Maxim', '(GARGH?!)')
('Paulette', "But I wouldn't mind if you showed Yumé around at<br/>the festival...")
('Paulette', '...and I might just come along with you.')
('Maxim', 'Oh, geez. Haha...')
('Maxim', "W-Well, that's fine by me!")
('Van', '(Wow. He actually had the balls to ask. And she<br/>AGREED...sorta.)')
('Van', "(He's got a real marathon ahead of him. I'll have to<br/>keep an eye on how he does.)")
('Maxim', "*sniffle* Thank you, Paulette. I'll make it the best day<br/>of her life!")
('Paulette', "Aww, don't go crying just yet.")
('Paulette', "You'd better not pass that habit on to Yumé, okay?")
('Maxim', "R-Right! I'll make sure of it!")
('Van', "(Can't blame her for being wary of him. Dude's got a<br/>lotta ground to make up.)")
('Paulette', "I'm relieved to see you're all back home safe.")
('Paulette', "Yumé's energetic as ever, so you can't just leave her<br/>without someone to play with, no?")
('Van', 'You got it.')
('Paulette', 'Ah, that reminds me.')
('Paulette', 'Are you all right with your room, Judith?')
('Judith', "Huh? Oh! Yeah, it's perfectly fine. You even got me<br/>furniture and everything!")
('Judith', "I just wasn't expecting you to recognize<br/>me off-screen.")
('Paulette', 'Well, as the landlady, I know a thing or two about<br/>my tenants. Heehee.')
('Judith', "I-I see...<br/>(...It's like she's giving me stage fright.)")
('Agnès', "(She's quite astute, yes.)")
('Van', '(Brings me back to when I first moved in.)')
('Paulette', 'It does worry me sometimes, how late Yumé stays<br/>out playing...')
('Paulette', '...but with all that energy, being cooped up inside is<br/>just torture for her.')
('Paulette', "If you see her while you're out and about, make sure<br/>to say hello, okay?")
('Paulette', "Thank you, Van. I'll talk to Yumé about your offer.")
('Paulette', "I'm sure she'll chomp at the bit for an opportunity to<br/>take a vacation.")
('Van', "Don't sweat it. I always like to go the extra selge on a<br/>job, you get me?")
('Van', "Three days is a bit on the long side, but I think she'll<br/>be all right.")
('Paulette', "I think she's about the age for a trip like that. She can<br/>handle herself.")
('Paulette', "And she'll be in your care! Heehee.")
('Paulette', "Yumé just can't get enough of XEROS, heehee.<br/>They're still outside playing with the other kids.")
('Paulette', "I hope that's not a problem, Quatre?")
('Quatre', "Oh, no, it's perfectly fine. I'm sure he'll get some<br/>interesting data for the trouble.")
('Quatre', "I don't believe XEROS has interacted with a group of<br/>children at once before. It's always good to broaden<br/>his horizons like that.")
('Paulette', "I see. I'm glad she's being helpful, at any rate!")
('Paulette', "FIO is always helping me out, too, so I'll have to<br/>reward them later.")
('Quatre', 'Ah... W-Well, thank you very much.<br/>(Man, I have no idea how to approach her.)')
('Agnès', "(She has quite the presence, doesn't she? No drone<br/>can quite match her.)")
('Paulette', 'Yumé should be home soon...')
('Paulette', "But time flies when she's having fun—I wouldn't be<br/>surprised if she runs a little late. Not that there's<br/>anything wrong with that, of course!")
('Paulette', 'Oh, good to see you, Van.')
('Paulette', "Care to join Yumé for some playtime? I'm sure she'd<br/>be delighted.")
('Van', "I'm good. Kiddo'll have me here all night. I got work<br/>to do.")
('Paulette', 'Heehee. Aaron is such a sweet young man. I can<br/>tell that he really cares about his friends.')
('Paulette', "Good luck at work! I'll have dinner ready for when<br/>you get back.")
('Paulette', "I imagine you're exhausted. Has work been treating<br/>you okay?")
('Paulette', 'Do let me know if I can give you any help or advice,<br/>Risette—that goes for professional and private<br/>concerns both.')
('Risette', "Heehee. Thank you. I appreciate the offer, though<br/>you've helped me more than enough already.")
('Risette', "You've given me not only a room, but full furnishings<br/>as well.")
('Paulette', 'Oh, I had that lying around in storage anyway. It was<br/>the least I could do...and I should be thanking you for<br/>all your clerical help, myself.')
('Risette', "Think nothing of it—I owe you as much for<br/>your hospitality. It's quite the good learning<br/>experience for me as well.")
('Paulette', "It's always fun learning new things, isn't it?<br/>Oh, speaking of new things, I've been meaning to try<br/>that black tea...")
('Agnès', '(Now, these two...)')
('Aaron', '(Like they were made for each other.)')
('Aaron', '(But damn, here I was, waiting all this time to hear<br/>why Paulette left her husband, and she goes and<br/>spills the tea to the maid?)')
('Van', "(Ain't a competition, bud. And don't let me catch<br/>you askin' her stuff like that.)")
('Paulette', "I can't thank you enough for all your clerical help.")
('Paulette', "How about I treat you to this black tea I bought the<br/>other day? It's the least I can do to repay you.")
('Risette', 'It would be my pleasure. I do look forward to it.')
('Paulette', "Yumé's been helping us out, so I'd like to do my fair<br/>share while I have the time.")
('Paulette', "Oh, right. Van? If you'd be so kind, your rent from<br/>last month is due.")
('Van', "(Shit, I forgot...)<br/>Oh, right. Sorry. I'll get you the cash before we<br/>head out.")
('Paulette', 'Heehee, thank you.')
('Paulette', 'I know it must be hectic up there in your office.')
('Paulette', 'Wages, taxes, utilities... You do have a lot on<br/>your plate.')
('Van', "Ain't that the truth...<br/>(Y'know, I really could use a secretary.)")
('Paulette', 'I know Agnès has been helping you with the mail.')
('Paulette', "If there's anything else you could use a hand with, do<br/>let me know. I'm sure I could be of use.")
('Van', "I owe you for that, thanks.<br/>(That's...kinda the problem, though. I owe her a lotta<br/>things already. Tch...)")
('Paulette', 'Hard at work as always, I see.')
('Paulette', 'I would appreciate some help with my errands, but I<br/>doubt you have the time...')
('Feri', "Oh, no, I can help out now! I've gotten used to<br/>the city.")
('Van', 'Hell, doubles as free experience, too.')
('Paulette', "I see! I might take you up on your offer, then—when<br/>you're free, of course.")
('Feri', "All right! I'll stop by for the details in a bit.")
('Paulette', "It's wonderful to see everyone helping the restaurant<br/>along like this.")
('Paulette', "Today's another busy day, so I'll need to do my<br/>part, too.")
('Paulette', "By the way, Yumé is off at Sunday School.<br/>She'll probably be playing with her friends afterward.")
('Paulette', "Our regulars fill up the place for our evening shift.<br/>I do wish they'd take it easier on the spirits, though...")
('Paulette', "Oh, that reminds me. You'll be up early<br/>tomorrow, right?")
('Van', "Yeah. Out around 6:30. I'll wake Yumes up if you<br/>need me to.")
('Paulette', "Thank you. I'm sure she'll try to wake up on her own,<br/>but you know her.")
('Paulette', 'How about I cook you breakfast tomorrow<br/>in exchange?')
('Van', "That'd be really nice. Sorry for all the trouble.")
('Paulette', "Oh, don't worry about it. Just make sure you get<br/>plenty of rest yourself, okay?")
('Paulette', "Yumé looks awfully tired, so I think I'll put her to bed<br/>early today.")
('Paulette', "I recommend you do the same, with your big<br/>morning tomorrow. Don't keep yourself up all night!")
('Paulette', "Goodness, how time flies. I can't help it, though—it's<br/>just so exciting to hear about what you've been up to.")
('Paulette', "I really owe Hans for his help. Perhaps I'll make him<br/>lunch today.")
('Paulette', 'Good work, you two. Your faces tell me you were<br/>really working hard out there.')
('Paulette', "I'll whip up some food for you, so you can come<br/>inside to wait for it.")
('Van', "(Maybe I'll go pick up some sweets from the<br/>florist first.)")
('Agnès', "(Right... If I remember correctly, it's just ahead.)")
('Agnès', 'Er, right!<br/>(Van, do we...?)')
('Van', "(Yeah. Let's go around the back, just to be safe.)")
('Paulette', 'Goodness, I never expected you would take up a<br/>part-time job with Van.')
('Paulette', 'To think Arkride Solutions would actually get an<br/>extra pair of hands... Heehee. It warms my heart<br/>to see it.')
('Paulette', "I'll treat you two to dinner tonight, so make sure to<br/>leave some room!")
('Paulette', "Good luck on your first job! Oh, I'm just so excited<br/>for you! ❤")
('Agnès', 'R-Right!<br/>(Why does she have me so flustered?)')
('Van', "(They don't call her the diva of the diner for nothin'.<br/>Her smile is the real deal.)")
('Paulette', 'You two take care, now!')
('Paulette', 'Do keep Agnès safe, okay?')
('Van', "You bet. A scratch on her's a scratch on my rep.")
('Agnès', "Right. I'm ready to go!")
('Hans', "Wait a minute... Oh, you're the guys who helped us<br/>out at the village!")
('Hans', "I didn't get to talk with you at the time, but I saw<br/>your truck pulled up out there.")
('Van', "Yeah, that was us. I think I remember seein'<br/>you, too... General store, right?")
('Van', "So what brings you...? Oh, that's right.<br/>Montmart sources veggies from Creil, yeah?")
('Paulette', 'We do. Hans here drops by every few days<br/>for delivery.')
('Paulette', 'You had quite the eventful stop out there, from what<br/>he told me. It makes me proud to be your landlady!')
('Hans', "I didn't get the chance to properly thank you before.<br/>We really owe it to you. We're finally settling back<br/>into our rhythm out there.")
('Hans', "You're welcome anytime, if you wanna stop by!")
('Agnès', 'That would be lovely!')
('Hans', "Oh, hey, it's you guys! You remember me, right?<br/>I'm from Creil Village.")
('Feri', 'Oh, Hans! Funny seeing you all the way out here.')
('Van', "You're on a delivery run, I take it?")
('Paulette', 'Mhm. He comes by every few days to deliver<br/>us produce.')
('Paulette', 'He did fill us in on what happened out there.<br/>Heehee... It warms my heart to have such<br/>upstanding tenants!')
('Hans', "Yeah, we're finally getting back to normal at home,<br/>and we've got you guys to thank.")
('Hans', 'The guild and the police are working things out...<br/>They said the whole case is really weird, though.')
('Hans', "But it's nice that they're helping us out—and thanks<br/>for your help, too! You're always welcome at<br/>the village.")
('Agnès', 'It would be our pleasure! Give them our regards when<br/>you get back.')
('Paulette', "It's nothing urgent, but I would greatly appreciate<br/>the help. Here's my shopping list...")
('Paulette', 'Oh, and if you have the chance, over at<br/>Centre Marché...')
('Feri', "Affirmative! So, Centre Marché, that's, umm...")
('Van', "Goin' shopping? Don't get lost, now.")
('Feri', "I'll be fine, trust me! I've already been here<br/>three weeks!")
('Aaron', "That's big talk, there! You'd better back it up, itty-bit.")
('Agnès', "Hang in there, Feri! I'll give it my best, too!")
('Aaron', 'Seven years single, huh? Damn shame.')
('Aaron', "Your man had a rockin' wife and a kid on the way,<br/>and he was still thirsty?")
('Aaron', 'Talk about blowing a lead, the dumbass.')
('Aaron', "Lady like you shouldn't have to settle for that.<br/>You thought about opening up again, finding yourself<br/>a real big fish?")
('Paulette', "Well, well, heehee. I appreciate your concern, but I'm<br/>quite content with where I am now.")
('Van', "Down, boy. That's her business and hers alone.")
('Van', "I'll tell you right now, if you don't—")
('Victor', "(Oh, this little bastard's got a death wish.)")
('Aaron', "What the...?! It's like somebody's got a sight on me!<br/>Aidios almighty...")
('Paulette', "(It's nice to see this place so lively. I'm quite the lucky<br/>lady to have such wonderful company. ♪)")
('Paulette', "Three days until the festival... We've got one last<br/>big push.")
('Paulette', 'Taste-testing the special menu, ordering enough<br/>ingredients, managing reservations...')
('Paulette', "There's a lot of work to be done, so time to roll<br/>up my sleeves and put my back into it!")
('FIO', 'FIO shall assist. Activating support program.')
('Feri', 'Man, having FIO around is a huge help!')
('Agnès', "Agreed. And we'll help whenever we have the<br/>chance, too. Let's make this Revolution Festival the<br/>best it can be!")
('Paulette', 'Oh, thank you all so much! Expect some tasty treats<br/>as thanks.')
('Van', "(Place is really boomin' now, ain't it?)")
('Yumé', "Wooow! I dunno how to play, but you two look like<br/>you're really good at it!")
('Yumé', "Oh! Is it your turn, Grandpa? Umm, umm... If I were<br/>the King, I'd do that!")
('Bergard', 'Well, that is hardly fair. You have a general<br/>assisting you.')
('Victor', "Heh heh... She's got a good head on her shoulders.<br/>I'm excited to play against her when she grows up.")
('Yumé', 'I dunno how you play this game, but it looks cool!')
('Yumé', 'Mom is sooooo slooow. She said she was gonna see<br/>him off, but...')
('Yumé', "Hmm... What's taking her so long?")
('Yumé', 'Oh! Grandpa told me about that!')
('Yumé', "So, umm, Mommy was telling me about...rivers she<br/>wants to buy? What does 'rivers I'd market' mean?")
('Gin', "You mean 'riverside market,' little lady.")
('Gin', "Mhm. Centre Marché came around about the same<br/>time. Nowadays, it's split up into these nine districts.")
('Yumé', "Ms. Gin tells some really cool stories! Wanna<br/>hear 'em?")
('Van', "We'd love to, but we're in the middle of work.")
('Agnès', "You'll have to share them with us later. Be a good girl<br/>and listen closely for us, okay?")
('Yumé', 'Okie dokie!')
('Yumé', "Were you talking about Maxim? He's funny, in a<br/>lame way. Heehee! ♪")
('Van', "Harsh. Don't let him hear that, okay?")
('Yumé', 'Doo, doo dee doo. Sweep, sweep it up! ♪')
('Yumé', 'I think I saw that weird guy before... Where, though?')
('Yumé', 'Uhh... Umm...')
('Yumé', 'Oh, yeah! There was a guy in the Tyrell Times!<br/>He looked like him!')
('Van', "You're somethin' else—saw right through his<br/>disguise, didn't you?")
('Van', "(No way she'd remember what he looks like—they<br/>broke up before she was born.)")
('Yumé', 'He was super weird! He kept crying all the time...<br/>Why was he so sad?')
('Yumé', 'I should try and cheer him up next time! Maybe he<br/>needs a pat on the back.')
('Van', "(Talk about rubbin' salt in the wound... Can't say he<br/>didn't have it comin', though.)")
('Yumé', 'Heeey! Come on and line up if you wanna give<br/>head pats!')
('Yumé', "Don't pat him all at once, or he'll get tired! One at a<br/>time, okay?")
('Quatre', "Well, I appreciate your concern, but he doesn't<br/>exactly get tired like a real dog would.")
('Quatre', "That said, it's important to treat him with care.<br/>You have my thanks.")
('Yumé', 'I AM the landlady, after all! Ahaha!')
('Agnès', "(Aww. She's imitating her mom.)")
('Van', "(Doesn't really have the presence for it yet, but no<br/>need to rain on her parade.)")
('Yumé', "Mhm! Don't worry! I'll take good care of XEROS<br/>for you!")
('Yumé', 'Good luck at work, everyone!')
('Yumé', "Wolves don't scare me! If I find any, I'll whoop<br/>their butts!")
('Van', "Hah! You're pretty spunky, ain'tcha? Don't let<br/>me down!")
('Yumé', "Heehee! I can do errands all by myself now,<br/>'cause I'm a big girl!")
('Yumé', "Oh, Anya, Anya! Lemme sing my walking song<br/>for you! It's called 'Yumé's Song'!")
('Anya', "Oh, yeah, the one we made together! Sure! Just don't<br/>get distracted while you're singing it, okay? We have<br/>to remember where we're going!")
('Yumé', 'Hey, come on! Stop drinking so much! You smell!')
('Yumé', "You have to walk home, right? Drink too much and<br/>you'll get all...clumsy!")
('Roman', 'I dun have anyone to come home to... Nubuddy cares<br/>about me... Hic!')
('Yumé', 'What do you mean...?')
('Yumé', "You gotta turn that frown upside down, or the happy<br/>thoughts won't come back!")
('Mark', 'Oh, Yumé! What kinda song are you gonna sing?')
('Yumé', 'Hmm... I wanna sing...')
('Yumé', '...something exciting! Like, really fast and<br/>fun, heehee!')
('Yumé', 'And it gives you so much energy that you can<br/>play forever!')
('Agnès', 'I look forward to hearing it.')
('Yumé', "Me too! I'll make sure to sing it for you guys!")
('Feri', "I can't wait to hear the finished song!")
('Yumé', "Me too! I'll make sure to sing it for you guys!")
('Aaron', "Oh? Shrimp's a singer-songwriter, now?")
('Yumé', 'Oh, hi, Aaron! I made a song for you.')
('Yumé', "At night, Aaron drinkies till his breath's all stinkies,<br/>and when Mommy finds out, she gets suuu-per mad!<br/>♪")
('Aaron', 'Hey, nix the slander!')
('Van', "Hah! You know you're drinkin' too much when even<br/>the kid calls you out. You really gotta scale that<br/>back, man.")
('Yumé', "I'm gonna write a super exciting song! One that<br/>makes everyone really happy and fun!")
('Yumé', "Once it's done, I'm gonna sing it for Mommy<br/>and Grandpa. Heehee!")
('Yumé', 'Zzz... Zzz...')
('Van', "Gonna catch a cold sleeping there, y'know?")
('Yumé', "I'm not...zzz...sleebing...")
('Yumé', "Heehee... Mommy's gonna read to me tonight...")
('Van', '(Aww. Went and tuckered herself out.)')
('Van', "(Paulette's right there, so she'll keep an eye on her.)")
('Yumé', "I'm not sleeping...")
('Yumé', "Mommy's gonna read to me...tonight...")
('Yumé', "Come out, come out! I'm gonna get'cha!")
('Van', "Kick the can, eh? You've got the can locked down,<br/>looks like.")
('Yumé', "Uh-huh! When I'm 'it,' I'm super-duper strong!")
('Yumé', "I'm gonna find Harry and Sheena, and I'm gonna<br/>catch 'em! Just watch!")

('Van', 'Wha...?! Why ONLY me?')
('Feri', "Don't knock it. It's good strength training!")
('Agnès', 'Ah, haha...')

('Yumé', "You're...touring? Hmm...")
('Yumé', "Oh, wait! So it's a DATE?! Van, you'd better es...<br/>escurt her, okay?!")
('Agnès', "Wh-Wha—? No! It's not a date, I assure you!")
('Van', "Where'd she pick up on that word? Anya, maybe...?<br/>Geez, these kids're a handful.")
('Yumé', 'Sweep, sweep it up! Get the floors nice and clean! ☆')
('Yumé', 'Take care of Agnès, okay?')
('Van', "Yeah, yeah. Don't worry about it.")
('Agnès', "(I-I'm sure she didn't mean anything by it, but...it's<br/>gotten kind of awkward now...)")
('Yumé', "So you're Agnès? Nice to meet you!")
('Yumé', "Hey, hey, can you come back again some time and<br/>play with me? You're fun to talk to!")

('Paulette', 'Welcome back! ㈱')
('Agnès', 'Thank you!')
('Agnès', 'Oh, are you going somewhere, Paulette?')
('Yumé', "There are some, umm, umm...in-greedy-ints we need,<br/>so she's going to Centre Marché in the 9th District!")
('Van', "You are? Man, I would've given you a ride if I had<br/>the time. Sorry about that...")
('Paulette', "Oh, not a problem. It's just a short bus ride away.")
('Paulette', 'Yumé, be a good girl and stay here with<br/>Grandpa, okay?')
('Yumé', "'Kay! Come back soon, Mommy!")
('Paulette', "Oh, no! An evil wolf! 'Little pig, little pig, let me<br/>come in!'")
('Paulette', "'No, not by the hair on my chinny chin chin!' said the<br/>little piggy.")
('Paulette', "'Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your straw<br/>house down! Grr!'")
('Yumé', "Aaah! Mommy's a really scary wolf!")
('Paulette', "Heeheehee. Watch out, Yumé, I'm gonna eat you!")
('Yumé', "Nooo! Don't eat me! Just go back to reading the<br/>story, please...!")
('Van', '(Man, she just does it all. Diva? More like divine.)')
('Van', '(She can read me a bedtime story anytime.)')
('Hawker', "You're telling me you put Sheena and Mark on your<br/>bike and got out of there? Man... That was real bold<br/>of you.")
('Hawker', "I'm damn proud of you, bud. I'm glad you three made<br/>it out okay.")
('Harry', "Of course we did, heh heh! I'm happy you're safe,<br/>too, Dad.")
('Harry', 'I was worried you were kinda out of shape because<br/>you work so much.')
('Hawker', "Hey, cut me some slack! Your papa's fit as a<br/>fiddle, promise!")
('Harry', "Oh, yeah! Guess who's eating a ton of festival food?<br/>This guy!")
('Harry', "I promised Sheena we'd go through the Riverside<br/>stalls together.")
('Harry', "Man, Dad's been talking to people this whole time.<br/>He's sooo slow!")
('Harry', 'Maybe I should go ahead and grab a spot...')
('Harry', "Dad's been working so much lately... I wonder if he<br/>can even keep up with me.")
('Harry', 'Heh heh. I gotta tell Mark and Sheena!')
('Harry', "They're probably gonna tag along, too, aren't they?<br/>We didn't tell them about it, but, well...")
('Harry', 'Hey, so the Revolution Festival is coming up, right?')
('Gin', 'The Revolution Festival?!')
('Gin', 'Of course it is, ya little brats!<br/>Remember the date!')
('Harry', "(Uh, what's up with her?)")
('Harry', "Every hero needs a special move, or something<br/>like that. I gotta think of one... I can't just mope<br/>around when I could be thinking up my super move!")
('Harry', "Dad has it tough. He's too tired to save Yumé and<br/>Mark if things get bad.")
('Harry', "But maybe I can use my bike to save them in a pinch!<br/>That'll be my superhero move! Yeah!")
('Harry', 'Hey, Daaad? You eat dinner?')
('Harry', 'Want me to make you an omelet?')
('Hawker', 'A wha—well, goodness, Harry! Since when did you<br/>learn to cook?!')
('Hawker', "I leave for a month and my boy's all grown up...<br/>I've missed so much.")
('Harry', 'Wow, this is so cool! Can I really play with him?!')
('Harry', "Hey, no fair, Yumé! Why didn't you tell me sooner?!")
('Van', "Kid's gettin' himself all worked up, sounds like.<br/>Just can't handle himself.")
('Quatre', "(I wasn't expecting my assistants to prove so popular<br/>with children... Not that I mind.)")
('Harry', "Oh, I almost forgot! Dad's coming back from his big<br/>trip today!")
('Harry', "I'm gonna tell him all about XEROS when he<br/>gets back!")
('Harry', "I've been living with Sheena's family for about a<br/>month now.")
('Harry', "It's so fun being able to play with her every day!<br/>And we get to do the shopping on the way home, too.")
('Harry', "Sheena's got a really good memory. She always<br/>remembers what we need to get after we're<br/>done playing.")
('Harry', 'Sergeant! I would like permission to use my trusty<br/>steed, Calibur 1, for this mission!')
('Sheena', 'You have my permission! Just be careful when riding<br/>with two people!')
('Harry', "Yes, ma'am!")
('Harry', "As long as I've got Calibur 1, there's nothing I<br/>can't do! Woohoo, haha!")
('Sheena', "Private Harry, are you listening? Be careful, this is a<br/>search and rescue mission. Don't screw up!")
('Hawker', "I can't just leave you alone for a whole month.<br/>You can't even cook for yourself!")
('Harry', "...Wait, so you mean I'm staying with Sheena<br/>and Mark? R-Really?!")
('Harry', 'I get to play with them EVERY DAY?! Yeah, I can<br/>totally do that!')
('Harry', "If we're gonna make music, I wanna make a really<br/>cool song! We can call it, uh...uhh, Harry's Song!<br/>Yeah!")
('Harry', "I wanna make it about my cool new bike! Let's try to<br/>fit that in, okay?")
('Harry', "*snore* Gah... Take...this... How d'ya like...<br/>that...? Zzz...")
('Harry', "Hey, Feri! This time I'll get my revenge.")
('Feri', "Sorry, I'm working today. I don't have the time<br/>for that.")
('Harry', "Okay. I just... I wanna beat you! You're so much<br/>better than me at everything...")
('Harry', 'When you get some free time, I wanna play with<br/>you again!')
('Harry', "I'm gonna practice super DUPER hard, so I can<br/>beat you next time! Just you wait!")
('Feri', "Sounds good! I'm looking forward to it, too.")
('Agnès', "(Sounds like she's getting along well with the kids.)")
('Van', "(Doesn't surprise me—she's got two younger siblings<br/>back home. I imagine it comes from experience.)")
('Harry', "Man, Yumé's too good at kick the can... Not even the<br/>no running rule works on her!")
('Harry', '...Wait, I have an idea! If I use Sheena as<br/>a distraction...')
('Harry', "So I caught a newt this morning, right? Now, what if<br/>I were to slip this down Sheena's back...? Heh heh.<br/>How high would she jump?")
('Agnès', 'Should I...not have heard that?')
('Feri', "He's a little troublemaker, haha.")
('Harry', 'Agh, dang it! I swear, this bike hates me.')
('Sheena', "Let's just go home for today... You really took a<br/>tumble, there.")
('Sheena', "I'll get that cleaned up, okay? Let's hurry on<br/>back, now. The sun's gonna set soon.")
('Harry', 'Ow, ow...! Man, you can be really harsh sometimes...')
('Harry', 'Man... I thought I was pretty strong, but... *sniffle*<br/>It really hurts...')
('Sheena', 'Oh, one of your buttons is falling off! Lemme put<br/>that back on. Can you gimme your pants?')
('Harry', "Wha—hey! Are you crazy?! I can't just take my pants<br/>off here!")
('Harry', 'Carrots, potatoes, artichoke... What else was there?')
('Sheena', 'Can you hold more for me, Harry? I was gonna buy<br/>some milk and a baguette for breakfast.')
('Sheena', "Hey, c'mon, Mark, let's go! What're you doing<br/>over there?")
('Harry', "Dinner's soon! We're gonna leave you behind if you<br/>don't catch up!")
('Harry', "All the grown-ups have been nervous<br/>about something... I think we're okay, though?")
('Sheena', 'We are...but I heard on the radio that Creil Village<br/>is...gone...')
('Harry', "I... I'll keep everyone here safe. I promise! I won't let<br/>all that bad stuff happen here.")
('Harry', 'That just made me think of a new super move!')
('Harry', "I call it the Flash Calibur! I take my bike, and then I<br/>jump off it, and I kick 'em in the face!")
('Sheena', '...Heehee. You read too many comic books, Harry.')
('Sheena', '(Thanks... I think that made me feel a little better.)')
('Mark', "Oh, hi, Mom! Hi, Dad! I'm feeling a lot better now!")
('Mark', "It's still kinda scary outside, but we'll wait right here!")
('Mark', 'Make sure you guys come by again, too. Okay?')
('Mark', 'Woohoo! I get to play with Harry all day!')
('Mark', 'And Sheena worked super hard to make lunch<br/>for him!')
('Sheena', 'Hey, zip it, Mark!')
('Mark', "O-Oops! I didn't know it was a surprise...")
('Mark', "Sheena's in a bad mood... I wonder why?")
('Mark', "But it's okay. I get to play all day! And Mom and<br/>Dad are here, too!")
('Mark', 'Harry looks super happy. He gets to play with Mr.<br/>Hawker all day!')
('Mark', "But then, does that mean he's not playing with us?<br/>I kinda wanted to play with him, too...")
('Mark', 'I, umm... I wanna go to the festival with Harry...')
('Mark', 'I, umm... I wanna go to the festival with Harry...')
('Mark', "Tomorrow, I'll invite him to go with me!")
('Mark', 'Oh, Ms. Gin? I have a question.')
('Mark', 'Have you always been running a candy shop?')
('Gin', "I sell tobacco, not candy! It ain't for kids, y'hear?")
('Gin', "Back then, though... Well, can't get too deep<br/>into that. I was pretty popular, is all I'll say...")
('Mark', "Oh! Mr. Hawker's back!")
('Mark', 'Harry and Sheena are really having fun!')
('Mark', "I love when everyone's smiling! It makes me happy.")
('Mark', 'I wanna play with them tomorrow, and the day after<br/>that, and then, and then...!')
('Mark', "We're taking turns giving head pats!")
('Mark', "But when Sheena's turn came, she got really excited<br/>and kinda freaked out.")
('Mark', "I've never seen her like that before, heehee!")
('Mark', 'Sheena and Harry have been going to the grocery<br/>store all by themselves lately!')
('Mark', 'They kinda remind me of Mom and Dad! Heehee...')
('Mark', "I wonder if they'll buy some candy, too...")
('Mark', "Oh, so, umm, Harry's living at my house right now!")
('Mark', "So every day we get to play! It's the best thing ever!")
('Harry', "(Mark, you're supposed to be a new<br/>recruit, remember?)")
('Mark', '(Oh, shoot! I forgot! I gotta go. See you guys later!)')
('Feri', '(Have fun!)')
('Aaron', "(Don't break a leg, kiddo.)")
('Mark', "Harumph! What is it, citizen? I don't have any<br/>business with you today.")
('Mark', "Don't get in my way, or I'll arrest you for treason!")
('Risette', '(What an upstanding young soldier he is. Heehee.)')
('Mark', 'Oh! Daddy brought an umbrella! Daddy!')
('Anya', "Huh, looks like he's talking to Sheena.")
('Anya', "I guess he wants to talk to her about something.<br/>Let's leave them alone for now!")
('Mark', 'Really? Okay, then.')
('Mark', 'I got really muddy when I was playing today.<br/>The rain made everything all yucky!')
('Mark', 'So I went to the bath with Sheena to get<br/>myself clean.')
('Mark', "But what's she talking with Dad about now?")
('Mark', 'So, I was thinking...')
('Mark', 'What kind of song should we make next? Hmm...')
('Mark', "I wish I were as good at it as Yumé. She's really good<br/>at making songs.")
('Mark', 'Maybe I should ask Father Nikolai for help.')
('Mark', 'Zzz... Harry, lemme play, too...')
('Mark', 'Oh, no! Yumé caught me...')
('Mark', 'Harry, Sheena, help! Hurry up and save me!')
('Agnès', 'I see their mission has taken a turn.')
('Feri', "They're rescuing a hostage, huh? Now that's exciting!")
('Van', "Yeah. We got our own job to do, though. Let's<br/>get rollin'.")
('Mark', 'Oh, no! Harry just fell!')
('Mark', 'Ouch, that looks like it hurt! You okay?')
('Sheena', "Well, it hurt for him, he's the one that fell. It doesn't<br/>hurt for you, 'cause you were just watching.")
('Sheena', 'Keep your voice down, okay? It freaks me out<br/>a little...')
('Harry', "Van, shh! She's gonna find us!")
('Mark', 'Yeah, shh! We gotta hide from Sheena!')
('Van', "My bad. Didn't realize you guys were playin' hide and<br/>seek again.")
('Van', "I'll get outta your hair, then. Just don't get yourselves<br/>into trouble, yeah?")
('Harry', "Heh heh! No problem! She'll never catch me!")
('Mark', 'Mhm! She always catches me instead, and then she<br/>makes me a hostage!')
('Harry', "C'mon, Mark, be positive! We're gonna win today, I<br/>know it!")
('Mark', "O-Okay! Sorry, Harry! I'll run as fast as I can!")
('Van', 'Oho! Good luck with that.')
('Agnès', 'Ah...haha...')
('Harry', "Today's the day we escape Sheena's deadly claws!")
('Harry', 'Are you guys going out to play, too?')
('Mark', 'Wait, are you playing with her?!')
('Agnès', 'Ah, no, umm...')
('Van', 'Nah, just work. You kids stay safe out there, all right?')
('Harry', 'Mark! Look!')
('Mark', "It's a...!")
('Mark', "IT'S A BIKE!")
('Harry', 'Oh, yeah! Dad bought it for me yesterday.')
('Harry', "Whaddaya think? Super cool, isn't it?")
('Mark', "Super DUPER cool! It's awesome!")
('Mark', 'Can I ride it with you? Pretty please?!')
('Harry', 'Sure! I wanna show you just how cool this thing is.')
('Harry', '...Wait, how DO you ride it again? I pushed it here<br/>from the house, so, uh...')
('Mark', "C'mon, Harry! Hurry up, let's go!")
('Harry', 'I-I know!')
('Agnès', "(Ah... I can't imagine he'll get very far without<br/>knowing how to ride it.)")
('Van', "(Cycling's startin' to catch on in the capital, but a<br/>lotta folks still dunno how to ride a bike.)")
('Harry', 'Hey, Van, can you teach me how to ride a bike?')
('Mark', 'Yeah, teach us! Teach us!')
('Van', 'Why, certainly. Cycling lessons for two come out to,<br/>lemme see here...thousand an hour. Sound good?')
('Harry', "No way! That's too much...")
('Agnès', 'Ah...haha...<br/>(You are just ruthless, you know that?)')
('Mark', "Mom and Dad said a lot of people died... I don't<br/>really get it.")
('Mark', "I'm kinda scared...")
('Yumé', 'Yeah. Me, too...')
('Yumé', "But we can't stay sad!")
('Yumé', 'Grandpa always says that laughter is the<br/>best medicine!')
('Yumé', "If you're too sad, you might get sick! You have to at<br/>least try and be happy, okay?")
('Mark', 'Really? I guess... Yeah, my chest has been kinda<br/>heavy lately...')
('Mark', 'Maybe I should go to the chapel for a check-up.')
('Yumé', 'Sure! We can pray there, too! Lemme come along<br/>with you.')
('Yumé', "Oh, but Mommy said we shouldn't go out alone.")
('Yumé', "So let's invite Sheena and Harry, too!")
('Mark', 'Oooh, good idea!')
('Hawker', "I can't thank you enough for helping Harry and<br/>the others.")
('Hawker', "I know it's not much, but please take this as<br/>my thanks.")
('System', 'Received 4 <br/>.')
('Van', "Gladly. I'll file that under official comp.")
('Hawker', "Oh, haha. Rest assured, I'll pay you properly once<br/>I can.")
('Hawker', 'Now, you be careful and come back in one piece,<br/>all right?')
('Hawker', "I really appreciate all you've done for the kids.")
('Hawker', 'Now, you be careful and come back in one piece,<br/>all right?')
('Hawker', 'Harry and the others... They went off to Riverside on<br/>their own!')
('Hawker', 'And with those damned monsters running about...<br/>Please, please be okay...!')
('Hawker', "Daddy's coming for you! Don't you worry!")
('Van', "(Should I, uhh...let him know they're fine? Or is that<br/>not the right move?)")
('Van', '(If Old Town were back to normal, I could just go<br/>with that, but...)')
('Hawker', "I was off on business for quite a long while.<br/>I've needed this break to decompress—all that<br/>constant work just isn't good for me, you know?")
('Hawker', "It's been some time since I've seen Harry—I'm sure<br/>he has much to tell me, and I, him.")
('Hawker', "It was a fine month in Oración, but I'm glad to be<br/>back home.")
('Hawker', "It feels like the kids grow up faster while I'm away...")
('Hawker', "It's good to get time to relax again—work is finally<br/>smoothing out.")
('Hawker', "I realized I couldn't work myself too hard as a single<br/>father—not when I had a kid to come home to.")
('Hawker', "But now that Harry's getting older, I don't feel quite<br/>as much pressure anymore.")
('Hawker', 'I really owe it to Robinson for helping me look<br/>after him. Real lifesaver, haha!')
('Hawker', "He's been playing all day? Haha! That's good to hear.")
('Hawker', "Old Town's always had these peppy, colorful<br/>characters, and my boy's no exception.")
('Hawker', "I'm deeply grateful to Sheena as well...")
('Hawker', "She really has her stuff together. She's almost like a<br/>second mom to Harry, at this point!")
('Robinson', "Being honest, you two splitting up really blindsided<br/>me...but I'm glad you're doing all right for<br/>yourself now.")
('Robinson', 'First Paulette, and then you, too... It always takes me<br/>by surprise.')
('Robinson', "And I think Brenda, too... Yeah, she's a widow.<br/>Her husband passed a while ago.")
('Hawker', "Quite some time, yes... He really was the light in<br/>her life. It's been hard for her...")
('Hawker', 'I always come home at around this time so I can<br/>make dinner.')
('Hawker', 'I used to be the type of guy who put work before<br/>everything else. I wanted to kick into high gear and<br/>ride the fast lane in my career...')
('Hawker', '...but then, life happened. I had to cut back my hours<br/>to raise Harry.')
('Hawker', "They responded by docking my salary. I just can't<br/>climb the ladder like I used to...")
('Hawker', "I can't say I didn't have it coming, though. I put<br/>family before work, and that's what I get.")
('Hawker', "...I think I'll make us some stew tonight.")
('Hawker', "If nothing else, I'm a better cook than young me used<br/>to be. Hahaha!")
('Hawker', "I'm heading out for work in the afternoon. It's good<br/>that I get the mornings to myself—that way, I can do<br/>all the housework before I leave.")
('Hawker', 'Oh yeah, I bought Harry a bike yesterday.')
('Hawker', 'But then, I realized: does he even know how to ride<br/>a bike?')
('Hawker', "It's hard to learn how to ride a bike before you<br/>actually have one, you know? So I think I'll need to<br/>teach him.")
('Hawker', "He's been begging for some playtime with his papa<br/>for ages now... I couldn't help it. I splurged.")
('Hawker', "But, well, I can't complain. I'll show him the ropes<br/>somewhere safe when I get the chance.")
('Hawker', 'Ahh... These mornings before work are so relaxing.')
('Hawker', 'And when it comes to pre-work coffee, no one does it<br/>better than Montmart.')
('Robinson', "You can say that again—Paulette's brews just hit all<br/>the right notes.")
('Robinson', "And don't tell Margaret I said this, but the sight of<br/>her serving me just brightens up my day, every time.")
('Hawker', "Don't tell her? Now, what's a friend of hers to do...?")
('Robinson', 'Hey, cut me some slack, man!')
('Robinson', "That Sheena and the gang I hear outside? Sounds like<br/>somebody's havin' a good time.")
('Hawker', "Oh, Harry, the menace. He'd better not be<br/>causing trouble...")
('Hawker', "I can't blame him, I've been too tired to play with him<br/>as of late. I just wish I had the energy...")
('Robinson', "Ah, don't beat yourself up over it. You're a good<br/>dad—and a far cry from the goon I tore up the town<br/>with when I was young.")
('Robinson', "To think it's been seven years already... I'd say you're<br/>doing pretty good, bud.")
('Robinson', "You've had a lot to work through over the years...and<br/>you did it all while working and raising Harry.<br/>That's nothin' to scoff at.")
('Robinson', "Just, you need to take care of yourself, too, y'know?<br/>You keep forgetting to pack your own lunches and<br/>you're gonna rack up a debt to Montmart.")
('Hawker', "Oh, I don't forget that often! Cut me some slack, I'm<br/>running a one-man operation.")
('Hawker', "...But for real, I don't think I could've done it if you<br/>guys weren't next door to help me.")
('Hawker', "You guys taught me how to deal with food,<br/>fevers...diapers. You've raised him just as much as<br/>I have!")
('Robinson', "Oh, stop. That's just what good neighbors<br/>do, y'know? Don't sweat it!")
('Robinson', "Sheena and Mark are really happy to have him, too.<br/>He's like a brother to them both.")
('Robinson', "We're one big family here, I feel like. Don't feel like<br/>you need to go it alone, okay?")
('Hawker', 'Yeah... Thanks again, Robinson.')
('Robinson', "Wait, WHAT?! They're putting you in charge of the<br/>Oración branch?")
('Robinson', "I... Just, holy shit! That's your big break, right there!")
('Hawker', "Well...it's an offer I can't accept.")
('Robinson', "...Ohh, because you'd have to pack your bags and<br/>move there with Harry?")
('Hawker', "I would...and I don't think that would be best<br/>for him.")
('Hawker', "I can't just turn his life upside down like that.<br/>My time with him is far more valuable than any<br/>job offer.")
('Robinson', "I get'cha... I just wish they could<br/>compromise, somehow.")
('Robinson', "...Y'know, maybe there is a way.")
('Hawker', 'Oh? What are you thinking?')
('Robinson', "Well, they're not saying you have to bring Harry with<br/>you, right?")
('Robinson', "Surely they're more flexible than that—it's just office<br/>work you do, isn't it?")
('Hawker', 'Man, since when did you learn so much about my<br/>job...? Do I really bellyache about it that much?')
('Hawker', 'But yeah, being an insurance company, we have our<br/>customer service hotline open seven days a week.<br/>It really wears me down...')
('Hawker', "I can slip away on my lunch breaks, at least, but Harry<br/>really misses me when I have to crunch... I'd hate to<br/>leave him alone for an entire month.")
('Robinson', "I'd be happy to have him stay with us. He comes over<br/>to our place for dinners anyway!")
('Robinson', "I'm more worried about you, honestly. Don't burn<br/>yourself out, you get me? Being in charge of a whole<br/>branch is a pretty big deal.")
('Hawker', "I only ever planned on being their point of contact to<br/>the main office, but it's been real hectic over there.<br/>They need backup.")
('Hawker', "We're in some pretty dire straits, financially. We need<br/>things to clear up soon, or we'll start having to<br/>make cuts.")
('Hawker', "How's your office holding up? You're in<br/>construction, right?")
('Robinson', "Architectural firm, yeah. We don't do the actual<br/>constructing, which is nice, but...")
('Robinson', "...top brass is saying this construction boom's bound<br/>to wear off. And where the market shrinks,<br/>layoffs follow.")
('Harry', "A whole MONTH?! But that's so long!")
('Hawker', "It is... I'm still considering the offer, though—I<br/>haven't accepted it. It's a very big promotion, so I<br/>want to think it through.")
('Hawker', "I know I work a lot, so, umm... I only want to take<br/>the job if you're okay with it. I promise I'll be back in<br/>a month.")
('Harry', "It's okay, Dad!")
('Harry', "I'm not a kid anymore, so a month is no biggie.")
('Harry', "It's okay that you're working hard. It helps me, too!")
('Hawker', "Haha... That's my boy. You're a good kid.")
('Hawker', "You'll be staying with Robinson's family while I'm<br/>gone. Be nice to Sheena and Mark, okay?")
('Harry', '...Huh? What do you mean?')
('Harry', 'DAD!')
('Hawker', "I'm home! Oh, it's so good to see you again!<br/>How've you been, bud?")
('Harry', "Yeah, I've been okay. Ooh, but check out<br/>XEROS, though! They're this AI and they can speak,<br/>and they're super amazing!")
('Hawker', "I-I see! Haha. I've got a lot to catch up on, from the<br/>sound of it.")
('Hawker', "I want to hear all about it, Harry! Let's hit the<br/>baths, okay?")
('Harry', 'You got it!')
('Harry', 'Wait, really?! You got time off for the<br/>Revolution Festival?!')
('Hawker', 'Yes, I did! Work is still plenty busy, but I pulled some<br/>strings to get the festival off.')
('Hawker', 'So, what do you say, Harry? Wanna hit the town<br/>with Dad?')
('Harry', 'Yeah! For sure! I wanna hit the food stalls!')
('Robinson', "I can't thank you enough for everything... You guys<br/>are lifesavers, man!")
('Robinson', "Doesn't look like this'll let up soon, but as long as my<br/>family's okay, I can manage!")
('Robinson', 'I know Paulette and Yumé are okay, too...<br/>They HAVE to be. You guys be careful out there,<br/>too, all right?!')
('Robinson', 'Gah... Busted myself up a bit back there.')
('Robinson', "But I got Margaret outta there, which is the<br/>important part. It's just, the kids...")
('Robinson', "...No, don't think about that. Harry's with 'em...<br/>they've gotta be okay.")
('Robinson', "Hawker's been busy lately. Can't even get away<br/>on his lunch anymore.")
('Robinson', "They're saying all that mafia business has been put to<br/>bed, but the insurance company he works at is still<br/>buried in claims...")
('Robinson', 'I can only hope stuff settles down by the time the<br/>festival rolls around. If not, kids are gonna lose it.')
('Robinson', "I was thinking I'd take it easy with the wife today.")
('Robinson', "Hope Hawker's holding up okay at work...")
('Robinson', "He SHOULD be home soon, but the man's a<br/>workaholic through and through. Who knows what<br/>he's dealing with over there.")
('Robinson', "He's been takin' care of himself and his kid better<br/>since the divorce, though. It was like a wake-up call<br/>for him.")
('Robinson', "He's right next door, so Harry and Sheena have<br/>grown up really close.")
('Robinson', 'He comes over pretty much every day to play<br/>with her. We have dinner together a lot, too.')
('Robinson', 'So him coming to live with us for the month is kinda<br/>just business as usual.')
('Robinson', "(Feel like he's had something on his mind lately...)")
('Robinson', "(He's a tough nut to crack sometimes, but I'll get it<br/>out of him one way or another.)")
('Natalia', 'Hmm... What in the world is happening now?')
('Natalia', "The sky's taken on a ghastly color, and these eldritch<br/>horrors are wandering the streets...")
('Natalia', "Alas, I don't think anyone will believe me if I<br/>tell them... I've cried wolf too many a time.")
('Natalia', 'This feels like some kind of nightmare...')
('Natalia', "...but I fear no one will believe what I say.<br/>That's really a shame...")
('Natalia', 'I plan on taking the festival nice and slow. I like to<br/>savor it at my own pace, heehee.')
('Natalia', 'Actually, I had quite the bizarre dream this morning.')
('Natalia', 'I recall some grand mystery had unfolded in town...')
('Natalia', "...but what lay beyond? That, I can't remember!<br/>Perhaps I was just too lost in the moment, heehee.")
('Natalia', 'Now, I plan on taking the festival nice and slow.<br/>I like to savor it at my own pace.')
('Natalia', "I'll have each and every stall wrapped around my<br/>finger when all's said and done. ♪")
('Natalia', 'Oh, you little tease, Étoile. You keep playing hard to<br/>get, and that only makes me want to tail you more!')
('Natalia', "You're better at leading people on than I could ever<br/>hope to be.")
('Natalia', 'Teach me your ways, Master Étoile! I beg you!')
('Natalia', "Oh, it's just terrible! Terrible news! The Revolution<br/>Festival has been delayed...")
('Van', 'You serious?')
('Natalia', '...because a ghost from 130 years past has risen from<br/>the grave and rent the Vantail District asunder!')
('Van', 'No way!')
('Natalia', "It's taken the president hostage! The government has<br/>sent Judith to negotiate!")
('Van', '...What.')
('Judith', "(Uhh... First I've heard of it.)")
('Agnès', '(This is, well...yeah.)')
('Quatre', '(Not these bogus stories again...)')
('Feri', '(Man, these stories are getting kinda old.)')
('Aaron', "(Ever thought about writing a book, grandma?<br/>You're good at fiction.)")
('Natalia', 'Oh, did my story not land? I thought I would get<br/>more of a rise out of you than that.')
('Van', "Yeah, you learn to pick up on it. I know that stuff is<br/>fun for you, but don't go overboard, okay?")
('Natalia', "*sigh* I'll just have to think of something more<br/>impactful next time. Something more<br/>up-front shocking!")
('Natalia', "I'd better polish my skills before the festival, lest I<br/>sully the Big Mum's good name!")
('Van', "(Good for you, granny. I'll steer well clear of that.)")
('Natalia', 'O Aidios, You who extend Your divine charity to us<br/>humans below...')
('Natalia', 'Please, forgive us and our foolishness, for we have<br/>sown conflict and hatred among ourselves...')
('Natalia', 'I pray that the good people of Creil may join You at<br/>Your holy side...')
('Agnès', "(She's much more solemn than usual today...)")
('Van', "(...Well, that's different. Usually her head's up in<br/>the clouds.)")
('Van', "(Remember hearin' from somebody that she lost her<br/>family in a terrorist attack...)")
('Van', "(Maybe that's part of the reason why she's otherwise<br/>so jovial...)")
('Natalia', "Oh, dearie me. I nod off to sleep just for a little bit<br/>and the whole day slips away. I'd best head on<br/>home now.")
('Natalia', 'Nights like these are when I feel the loneliest...but<br/>then, winter is on the horizon, too.')
('Natalia', 'Perhaps I should warm myself back up with some hot<br/>borscht from Montmart, heehee.')
('Natalia', "It's nights like these where I can't help<br/>thinking back... On a lot of things, really...")
('Natalia', "But perhaps it's best I take my mind off those things.<br/>I'll take a quick nap and then head to Montmart—<br/>their borscht is lovely this time of year.")
('Natalia', "Goodness, who could have imagined he'd find<br/>himself with Judith?")
('Natalia', "As a fan of both, I'm rather conflicted.")
('Natalia', 'Judith has this charismatic aura about her...and then<br/>Maxim is just a total charmer.')
('Natalia', "But together? Hrm... I just don't see it, myself.")
('Agnès', '(It seems the rumors are making the rounds already...)')
('Van', '(Why DO fools fall in love?)')
('Agnès', '(Aww, be nice, Van.)')
('Quatre', "(The rumor's causing quite a stir...not that it matters<br/>much, in the grand scheme of things.)")
('Natalia', 'I went to catch a movie for the first time in a while,<br/>and my goodness, it shook me to my core!')
('Natalia', "Heehee... My heart is still racing. I've worked up an<br/>appetite, even! Steak sounds quite nice to me...")
('Natalia', "I heard last week's film festival in Tharbad turned<br/>into quite the fiesta.")
('Natalia', 'Spontaneous dancing in the streets... A massive<br/>improv that saw an entire hotel occupied...')
('Natalia', 'It does bring me back. You know, I was an actress, in<br/>a previous life.')
('Natalia', 'Perhaps I should have gone there and lived it up<br/>anyway, my back be damned.')
('Natalia', 'Oh, hello, dear. Good to see you here.')
('Natalia', 'I found myself a bit discomposed tonight, so I<br/>decided to pay my respects.')
('Natalia', "I just hope we can find peace again, in spite of<br/>all that's wrong with the world.")
('Natalia', 'O Aidios, guide our wayward souls...')
('Natalia', 'I read in this magazine that criminal activity is on the<br/>rise—and the mafia is to blame.')
('Natalia', 'I nearly brought a certain criminal empire toppling<br/>down, back in my SID days...')
('Natalia', 'If I just had the strength to finish the job, perhaps I<br/>could have prevented this resurgence in crime. It does<br/>weigh heavy on me...')
('Van', "(Does it? I couldn't tell, sorry. Performance wasn't<br/>very convincing.)")
('Natalia', "Oh, dear... I forgot to buy my medication.<br/>Father Time is taking me to task, I'm afraid.")
('Natalia', "I've found it difficult falling asleep, too... Perhaps I<br/>should start taking some sleeping pills. I could stand<br/>to take some vitamins as well...")
('Natalia', "...is what a quitter would say! I'd much rather stick to<br/>protein—I've gotten into weight lifting recently, and<br/>old age can't stop me!")
('Van', '...Well, no, but your back can.')
('Natalia', "Oh, I'll be fine! But thanks anyway!")
('Natalia', "There's this gray cat who roams Old Town. Have you<br/>seen it? Its name is Étoile.")
('Natalia', "It's a very skittish cat, you see...and I believe I<br/>know why. The cat hides a special secret.")
('Natalia', 'I saw it, under the light of the full moon...<br/>It transformed into a human and leapt out of sight!')
('Natalia', "It's Grimcat, I'm sure of it! Mweheehee... That prize<br/>money will soon be mine!")
('Agnès', "(I'm having a hard time believing any of this...)")
('Van', "(Yeah, 'cause it's total BS. Just ignore her.)")
('Feri', "(No way... Could that be Grimcat's true identity?!)")
('Van', '(No, no. A hundred percent no. Just ignore her.)')
('Natalia', "At any rate, one thing's for certain: that cat is special.")
('Natalia', 'If you happen to run across it, treat it well, okay?<br/>It might repay the favor. ♪')
('Natalia', 'Well, hello there, dear.')
('Natalia', 'The unease on your face... The dark shadow creeping<br/>along your back... I see what ails you, young lady.')
('Natalia', 'Could it be you...forgot to buy ingredients for supper?<br/>Mweheehee! I can sympathize.')
('Agnès', '(*sigh* She was really starting to unnerve me there...)')
('Van', "(Yeah, that's her usual song and dance. Don't let her<br/>bother you.)")
('Van', 'Oh, hey...')
('Natalia', 'Ah! Good day to you, dear.')
('Natalia', 'And the young lady with you... My, how adorable<br/>she is.')
('Agnès', 'A-Ah, thank you.')
('Agnès', "I'm starting my part-time job at Arkride<br/>Solutions today.")
('Natalia', "Is that so? You're quite the go-getter for your age!")
('Natalia', 'I used to run a little oddjob business, myself.<br/>Only recently did I retire.')
('Natalia', 'In my heyday, they called me the Legend of the<br/>Eighth District! I had no shortage of work, heehee!')
('Agnès', 'Oh, wow. Really?')
('Van', "Nah. Stretchin' the truth is her real pastime. You get<br/>used to her.")
('Van', "Make sure to take it easy, all right? Don't wanna<br/>throw out your back again.")
('Natalia', "Oh, I'll be fine. But thank you for your concern,<br/>young man. Heehee.")
('Agnès', '(So, she was lying back there...?)')
('Van', '(*sigh* This is not your ordinary neighborhood.)')
('System', "Oh, I'll be fine. But thank you for your concern,<br/>young man. Heehee.")
('System', "I'd be pleased as punch if we could chat again<br/>some time. ♪")
('Agnès', 'Ah, well, haha... It would be my pleasure.')
('Natalia', 'Ahh, breakfast was simply wonderful this morning.<br/>Montmart never disappoints...')
('Natalia', '...but dessert is my real craving!')
('Natalia', 'Will their treats be enough to satisfy my sweet tooth?')
('Gin', 'Looks like the monsters got cleared out.')
('Gin', "I did the rounds, and it looks like everybody's okay.<br/>Wouldn't hurt for you to give the neighborhood a<br/>check, too.")
('Van', "Good to hear—I think I'll go ahead and<br/>double check. Gotta get my equipment in order, too.")
('Van', "Don't go wanderin' around too much, okay? Ain't all<br/>clear just yet.")
('Gin', "Yeah, yeah. The same goes for you, young'uns—use<br/>your heads out there!")
('Feri', 'Mhm! Roger that!')
('Gin', "Ain't no tellin' what those mafia bastards are up to...")
('Gin', "...but if they think they can mess with the festival,<br/>they're in for a whoopin'.")
('Gin', "There's gotta be a fix for all this! Keep yer wits about<br/>you, young'un, you got it?")
('Van', "That's the plan! You stay safe, okay?")
('Feri', "We'll fix this mess, we promise!")
('Gin', "You're late. Where the hell've you been?")
('Gin', "Just leave the kids to me and get goin', got it?! I won't<br/>let 'em scratch a hair on their heads!")
('Shizuna', "(Oho... Quite the aura she's got.) Who's this lady?")
('Kincaid', 'Oh? Who would this be?')

('Van', "'Preciate it, Gin. Just don't get in over your head!")
('Gin', "Hmph, of course! Who do you take me for?<br/>Worry about yourself first, young'un!")
('Gin', "Can't just leave everything to the youngsters—not<br/>when I'm still up and kickin'!")
('Gin', "Just leave the kids to me and get goin', got it?! I won't<br/>let 'em scratch a hair on their heads!")
('Gin', "I'm sure you already know the Revolution<br/>Festival is the turnin' point of the year.")
('Gin', "You gotta welcome the new year right! Now's the<br/>time to celebrate and shake off all the baggage from<br/>the year before.")
('Agnès', "We'll make sure of it! Thank you!<br/>(Goodness, she's excited about it.)")
('Feri', "Heehee! I'm really excited for the festival, too!<br/>Thanks, ma'am!")
('Aaron', "Well, you've changed your tune, haven't you?<br/>You sound nice for once.")
('Risette', "This year's will be my first Revolution Festival as well.<br/>I do look forward to it.")
('Quatre', 'We had a fair in Basel, but nothing on this scale.<br/>It does pique my interest.')
('Judith', 'Yeah... I remember my grammy felt the same way<br/>about the festival.')
('Bergard', "I don't see the harm in letting loose for the<br/>holidays—that is what they are for, after all.")
('Van', "She gets like this around the holiday season. Maybe it<br/>means somethin' different to her generation, I dunno.")
('Gin', "This year, I've got a new flavor: Rainbow Candy.")
('Van', 'RAINBOW Candy?! Gimme a dozen, stat.')
('Gin', 'Heh. Sweet tooth as always.')
('Gin', "For the festival, it's tradition to go around and greet<br/>your neighbors, so make sure ya do the rounds today.")
('Gin', "And give the kids a little somethin' for the trouble.<br/>Candy works—or roasted chestnuts, if you got 'em.")
('Gin', 'Now, this part looks great, dunnit?')
('Gin', "The decoration people're really draggin' their feet.<br/>If they take any longer, I'm lightin' a fire under<br/>somebody's ass!")
(15038, "I-It'll be fine, I'm sure! We still have three more days!")
('Van', "You really don't have to be so much of a slave driver<br/>about it.")
('Gin', "Hmph. Can't help it. It's either them or the<br/>neighborhood association, and those guys are<br/>even worse.")
('Gin', 'Van, you help later! You young folks gotta do<br/>your part.')
('Van', "I'm not takin' more work for free, lady!")
('Gin', "Well, I need help, and it's either you or the<br/>neighborhood association. Can't trust THEM for<br/>nothin', so you it is!")
('Gin', "I know you ain't got nothin' else to do, Van.<br/>Can't talk your way outta this one.")
('Van', "I mean, I didn't even say no—just—can you get off<br/>my ass first?")
('Van', "Oh, before I forget: Curtis' family got things<br/>worked out. That's all good now.")
('Gin', 'Hmph. Good for them.')
('Gin', "Ain't never my problem, anyway. They're the ones<br/>who got all pissed about it.")
('Gin', "They'd better get their heads screwed on straight<br/>before they come yowlin' at me again.")
('Gin', "Honestly, what's the point gettin' their panties in a<br/>twist over 'foul language' and 'bad influences'?")
('Gin', "Every kid gets a rebellious phase! And she ain't got<br/>nobody to blame but herself for how her kid<br/>grows up.")
('Gin', 'So back when they had to re-zone everything, they<br/>gave each area a number.')
('Gin', "At the time, the main way of gettin' around was by<br/>horse and carriage, so the numbers made everything<br/>easier to understand.")
('Gin', "And that's why Vantail, with all the government<br/>offices, was given the number 'one.'")
('Harry', 'Oooh, so the numbers were added later!')
('Sheena', 'That makes sense!')
('Van', '(Huh. Pretty good with kids for a spinster.)')
('Gin', "(What's that supposed to mean, sonny?)")
('Gin', "(Go on, scram! Don'tcha got better things to do?)")
('Gin', "(Yeesh... How'd I end up babysitting a bun'cha kids?)")
('Gin', "(Well, whatever. I'll just ramble on for a bit and send<br/>'em home.)")
('Gin', "Bah. Radio and the rags are all sayin' the same things.")
('Gin', "Just nothin' else going on. Them politicians had<br/>better not be sittin' on their asses and<br/>twiddlin' their thumbs.")
('Gin', "Guess they did do the state of emergency, at least.<br/>You young'uns be careful out there, got it?")
('Agnès', 'We will, thank you.')
('Gin', "And you, new girl. You stand out in those clothes!<br/>Don't go showin' off too much skin!")
('Judith', 'Err, me?! Umm, right!')
('Judith', '(Scared the pants off me for a second there—I<br/>thought she figured me out!)')
('Van', "(Don't go spacin' out on me, miss A-lister.)")
('Gin', "Government's draggin' their feet and their knuckles,<br/>as usual. Maybe all the peace made 'em forget how to<br/>run things.")
('Gin', 'And kids these days, I swear... Bah, whatever.<br/>You folks be careful out there, got it?')
('Gin', "The little runt from the church's been followin'<br/>me everywhere. Didn't even have the chance to buy<br/>groceries 'cause she was tailin' me.")
('Gin', "And I get the feelin' she'll be back tomorrow.<br/>What am I gonna do with her...?")
('Gin', "...Least Brenda's gotten herself sorted out.")
('Gin', "Hmph. I've got that other boy to babysit, too, in<br/>all likelihood.")
('Gin', "Why don'tcha do somethin' about it, Van?")
('Van', "Aww, have a heart, grandma! Just tell them some<br/>stories from back in the day or somethin'.")
('Gin', "Tch. You like watchin' me suffer, don'tcha? You keep<br/>laughin' and I ain't sellin' you candy no more!")
('Agnès', "(I can't help but feel like they secretly don't mind<br/>each other... Heehee. Vitriol is a funny thing.)")
('Gin', "That Victor's a whiny ol' coot. Ain't even broke sixty<br/>and he's bellyachin' about his back, the li'l ninny.")
('Gin', "And youngsters these days are all so lazy. It's all cars<br/>and trains and 'public transportation' for them!")
('Gin', "Back in my day, we walked and we liked it! Was good<br/>exercise and you didn't need no road or subway line to<br/>get where you wanted.")
('Van', 'Oh, sure, lemme just walk to Vantail from here.<br/>Not impractical at all when a car can get me there<br/>in minutes.')
('Gin', "You kids and your cars... Bah! Bun'cha softie drivel<br/>turnin' yer legs to mush.")
('Gin', "You keep drivin' everywhere and the kids'll be able to<br/>outrun you.")
('Gin', '...You, in the maid getup.')
('Van', "Look, grandma, it's not what you think.")
('Gin', "I ain't said nothin' yet! Shut your trap!")
('Gin', "I just see her cleanin' out here in the mornin', so I<br/>wanted to chat with her a bit.")
('Risette', "Oh, that's simply an old habit of mine. Please, pay me<br/>no mind.")
('Risette', 'I hold your own routine in much higher regard,<br/>Ms. Gin. Your professionalism and diligence is<br/>truly inspiring.')
('Gin', "Eh, I've just been doing this for some eighty years.<br/>Ain't nothin'.")
('Gin', 'You sound like you got a good head on yer<br/>shoulders, though. Real beauty, too—brings me back<br/>to my youth.')
('Aaron', "Your...youth? Such a thing existed? Are we sure she<br/>isn't yanking our chains?")
('Van', '...Anybody else feel a chill just now?')
('Gin', "QUIET, all of you! Freakin' kids...")
('Risette', 'Heehee...')
('Agnès', 'Another...peaceful day in Old Town?')
('Gin', "I ain't aged all that gracefully, but I used to be a<br/>real looker. They called me the Old Town diva.")
('Gin', "...I saw that. I ain't pullin' your leg like that Natalia,<br/>just so you know!")
('Feri', "So, if Paulette's the diva now...")
('Feri', '...then that makes you the original one, right?')
('Gin', '...Heh. Your girls are all sweethearts. Shame about<br/>the rest of you.')
('Van', 'Ouch, haha.')
('Gin', 'Now then...what do I make for dinner tonight?<br/>Could always do curry...')
('Gin', "...What? You ain't getting none of it. I like my<br/>curry spicy.")
('Van', "That's okay, I never asked.")
('Gin', "Heard the film festival over in Messeldam got called<br/>off for terror threats...and then the killings over<br/>in Langport. It's just despicable, all of it.")
('Gin', "How long's it gonna take for these stupid dogs to<br/>stop barkin'?")
('Gin', "You headin' out? The weather's supposed to get bad<br/>today, so bundle up.")
('Agnès', 'Thank you! See you later, Ms. Gin!')
('Feri', "Roger that, ma'am!")
('Aaron', "Heh. When a shriveled old spinster's telling you the<br/>weather's bad, that's how you KNOW it's bad.")
('Gin', 'Hey! I may be old, but I can still kick yer ass, brat!<br/>Now beat it!')
('Van', "Pick your fights, man. Let's just go.")
('Gin', "Victor's really come into his own across the<br/>street, here.")
('Gin', "Wish he wouldn't run that big mouth of his so much,<br/>but I like how he's kept true to himself. It all tastes<br/>the same as it did decades ago.")
('Gin', "Used to be a li'l brat like you, actually. But he's grown<br/>up, now that he's got a good family.")
('Gin', "Cops ain't found nothin' new on the mafia?<br/>The hell're we givin' 'em our tax mira for?")
('Gin', "...Y'know.")
('Gin', "For a lone wolf 20-something, you've got an awfully<br/>young assistant, there.")
('Gin', "And now yer draggin' a kid around, too? You'd better<br/>explain yourself, or I'm ringin' your ass up.")
('Van', "Okay, I, uhh...heh. I can tell you that's NOT what<br/>it is. You're misunderstanding, Gin.")
('Feri', '...Huh?')
('Agnès', "Let's, umm... Let's move on from this topic, shall we?")
('Gin', "I've got my eye on you... You do anything funny,<br/>they're throwin' your ass in the clink.")
('Van', "I'm gonna have to clear this up with you later.")
('Gin', "Hmph. Meet me at the bowling alley and then<br/>we'll talk.")
('Agnès', '(Another peaceful day in Old Town...)')
('Gin', "Huh? Who're you...?")
('Gin', "Oh, just you. Thought I saw someone shady<br/>slinkin' around. You done with work for the day?")
('Gin', "I'm about to close up shop, too. I gotta do my<br/>shopping for the day.")
('Gin', "When'd it get so late? The sun sets so early now...")
('Gin', "I'd best close up soon, too. Gotta get my shoppin'<br/>done before it gets too dark.")
('Gin', "Get'cher Tyrell Times, a hundred mira.")
('Gin', "Hurry yer ass up. I ain't got all day.")
('Van', '*sigh* Always so kind.')
('Agnès', 'One copy of the paper...and some candy, I take it?')
('Agnès', "Oh, would you happen to have any new<br/>flavors, ma'am?")
('Gin', '...Matter of fact, I do. Melon soda flavor.')
('Van', "The he—you readin' my mind?!")
('Agnès', "E-Err, hardly, haha! It's just a habit I picked up on.<br/>Should I...not have?")
('Van', "Uhh... Well, no, that ain't the problem.")
('Gin', "Hey, quit yer yowlin' and buy somethin', already!")
('Agnès', 'Sorry, sorry!')
('Van', "Ain't gotta tell me twice.")
('Gin', '...You better not make that lady cry, sonny.')
('Van', "Look, we're not like that, okay?")
('Agnès', '(I think she has the wrong idea...)')
('Gin', "Well, whatever. I don't have all day, so get to it.")
('Gin', "Hell are you two yowlin' about? I ain't got all day,<br/>buy somethin'!")
('Van', "I'll have the usual, please. If you got any new flavors,<br/>I'll take some of those.")
('Gin', 'Listen here.')
('Gin', "I run a tobacco joint! You hear me? To-BACCO! All<br/>you buy is yer damn candies and paper! Buy<br/>somethin' else, already!")
('Van', "Not my fault I don't smoke, ma'am. Now, what else<br/>do I need...?")
('Gin', "You listen to me when I'm talkin' to you!<br/>Freakin' kids these days...!")
('Agnès', 'Well...hmm.<br/>(Are they always like this?)')
('Gin', "You workin' with him? ...Whatever. Just make sure<br/>you do the job right.")
('Gin', "No work, no eat! That's how it goes.")
('Van', "I know, I know. No time to slack off when<br/>you're self-employed.")
('Agnès', "Thank you. I'll make sure to do my best work!")
('Rebecca', "I-It's like time just stopped... I didn't wanna go<br/>outside to look, but...")
('Rebecca', "...this is blowing my mind. I think I'm...I'm too<br/>curious to be scared of the outside! Just what IS<br/>this phenomenon?")
('Rebecca', "N-No, I can't get distracted! I have to try and help!")
('Rebecca', "Huh? I can't use the orbal net, but the network says<br/>I'm still connected...")
('Rebecca', "Networks aren't really my field, but I'll take a look<br/>and see if I can figure something out.")
('Van', "Got'cha, thanks. Best of luck.")
('Feri', 'Be careful out there!')
('Rebecca', "I can't use the orbal net, but the network itself says I<br/>still have a connection...")
('Rebecca', 'There was this weird transmission I got, right before<br/>everything went all screwy—like someone overrode<br/>the network or something...')
('Rebecca', "This isn't my area of expertise, but I'll take a look and<br/>see what I can do. If there's anything else I can help<br/>with, let me know!")
('Rebecca', "Whoa, this... This clock here goes all the way back to<br/>the middle ages! It's got a lot of parts missing, but...")
('Rebecca', '...Heh heh. I think I can fix you up. You sit tight, my<br/>antique little friend! ♪')
('Van', "(Go figure she'd find somethin' completely unrelated<br/>to the festival. Not knockin' it, though.)")
('Agnès', '(She does march to the beat of her own drum.)')
('Feri', "(Wow, she's really having fun!)")
('Aaron', '(Why make friends with real people when you can<br/>cozy up to a clock?)')
('Risette', "(Fulfillment takes many forms... Heehee. I'm happy<br/>for her.)")
('Quatre', "(I remember that same giddiness from when I showed<br/>her XEROS... Well, there's nothing wrong with<br/>being passionate, I suppose.)")
('Judith', "(Quite the interesting lass... She'd make a good<br/>character study, I think!)")
('Bergard', '(She appears to be in a world of her own. It would be<br/>best not interrupt her.)')
('Rebecca', 'Now this is the stuff! Antiques! Rare parts!<br/>Supremity! JUSTICE! I want ALL the techies!')
('Van', 'She, uhh... Think she mighta forgotten how to speak.')
('Rebecca', 'Kaina dropped by recently, and we got to catch up for<br/>a little while.')
('Rebecca', "Now that things have finally settled down, she's<br/>continuing her studies over at Sylvie's place.")
('Rebecca', "I'm glad for her... She really is strong willed.")
('Rebecca', "I'd love to go and visit her, but umm...umm...")
('Rebecca', "I-I can't. Not outside... *sigh* I'm such a mess.")
('Rebecca', "Kaina's such a strong girl...")
('Rebecca', 'She handles the outside just fine... *sigh* But then<br/>look at me.')
('Rebecca', 'Well, u-um... According to my calculations, it was<br/>SUPPOSED to be safe outside, but...')
('Rebecca', '...but I never expected something like this. Just,<br/>why...?')
('Rebecca', "*sniffle* What do I say to her...after that? I just...<br/>I don't know what to do...")
('Rebecca', 'I think about the Basel Institute a lot... How cool it<br/>would be to study there.')
('Rebecca', "I wish I could just pack my bags and go right now...<br/>but then I'd have to SEE people and TALK to<br/>them and... And...")
('Rebecca', "Gaaah, it's not happening! Just thinking about it<br/>makes me wanna curl up and hide!")
('Rebecca', "These materials... The orbal system... What's all this<br/>for...?")
('Rebecca', 'Shard tech is one thing, but LOOK at this!<br/>An honest-to-goodness mech! In front of my<br/>very eyes!')
('Rebecca', 'This is so exciti—gah?! E-Ew, why is my<br/>nose bleeding?!')
('Van', "Whoa! Easy there. Don't get too worked up, now.")
('Quatre', "Well...would you be interested in taking a look at<br/>FIO and XEROS, perhaps? I wouldn't mind.")
('Rebecca', 'R-Really?!')
('Quatre', "Sure. I imagine I'll be dropping by this store<br/>often anyway.")
('Rebecca', "(He works with mechs AND he's attractive?!<br/>Aidios, give me the strength...!)")
('Feri', 'Uhh... Are you okay? You look really woozy. Do you<br/>need some water?')
('Aaron', 'What no vitamin D does to a girl.')
('Risette', 'Ah... I admire your enthusiasm, but I implore you to<br/>mind your health.')
('Rebecca', "Oh, this is it. Everything's going white...")
('Rebecca', '...No! Not yet! Not until I get to explore every nook<br/>and cranny of those beautiful machines!')
('Van', "That's the spirit, kiddo!")
('Rebecca', 'Whenever something gets me curious, I can look it<br/>up on the orbal net.')
('Rebecca', "It's so ridiculously useful! I've got tons and tons of<br/>papers and articles all at my fingertips.")
('Rebecca', "But the net doesn't cover everything... Some topics<br/>come up that I just can't find any dirt on.")
('Rebecca', "*sigh* There's one article I wish I could learn<br/>more about. If only I could ask the author.")
('Rebecca', 'WHOA! R-R-R-R-Risette?!')
('Feri', '(Wow. She really stuttered there.)')
('Aaron', "(Hey, DJ, your record's broken.)")
('Agnès', '(Is she...all right?)')
('Risette', 'I much enjoyed our dialogue on applied shard theory.<br/>Thank you very much.')
('Rebecca', 'N-N-Not at all! I-I should be thanking you for<br/>putting up with all of my questions.')
('Rebecca', "Could I, umm... Could I ask you about it some more,<br/>some time? There's still some stuff I can't wrap my<br/>head around.")
('Risette', "It would be my pleasure. I'll answer whatever<br/>questions I can.")
('Rebecca', "(No. Freaking. WAAAAAY, that's<br/>AWESOME!)")
('Van', "Ain't that nice? It's, uhh...okay to actually voice your<br/>excitement, though. Don't have to bottle it up<br/>like that.")
('Rebecca', "We do have a Xipha tuning device here, but I don't<br/>really know much about applied shard theory.")
('Rebecca', "I want to try and make a shard device all on my own.<br/>I'm gonna give myself until, umm...until next week.")
('Agnès', "Goodness, that's...quick.")
('Risette', 'My. If you can deliver a proof-of-concept that<br/>quickly, Marduk might have an engineering position<br/>in your future.')
('Rebecca', "Kaina's been getting a lot better... She says she might<br/>go out to study in Basel.")
('Rebecca', 'It must be so nice for her to travel like that...')
('Rebecca', "I wish I could be more like her. I just...don't<br/>get people. They scare me.")
('Rebecca', "If I could just take a step outside... I'd learn about so<br/>many new things, meet so many new people...")
('Rebecca', 'P-People... Gah, no! Happy thoughts!<br/>Happy thoughts!')
('Rebecca', "I'm glad Kaina's doing all right.")
('Rebecca', "I love Kaina. She's just adorable, and she makes good<br/>stuff, to boot.")
('Rebecca', "Ooh, you've got lots of interesting stuff in here.<br/>What more will I find once I take you apart?<br/>Heh heh heh...")
('Rebecca', "We had too many customers today... I'm out of<br/>social points. But they all gave me some really<br/>fun jobs.")
('Rebecca', 'Somebody brought in this wristwatch that got run<br/>over by a car. I pretty much had to rebuild it<br/>from scratch.')
('Rebecca', 'I love machines with all the really precise bits...<br/>Heh heh.')
('Van', "Smilin' up a storm, there... You're kinda cute when<br/>you're tinkerin' with stuff.")
('Rebecca', "Wha—don't stare at me like that!")
('Rebecca', "I can't help it... You know how I get when I start<br/>tinkering with stuff.")
('Rebecca', "I said stop staring, you...you jerk! Gah, why can't I<br/>just be invisible?!")
('Rebecca', "(I can't think straight when there are people around!<br/>J-Just stop looking at meee!)")
('Rebecca', "(I really should clean up my room and move my<br/>workstation in there...but I can't even walk on<br/>the floor. There's too much junk in there.)")
('Rebecca', "(I can't even sleep in my own bed... *sniffle* I'm such<br/>a wreck...)")
('Feri', "(She's actually really pretty... There's just something<br/>weird about her.)")
('Van', "(Poor brother's got his hands full with her.)")
('Agnès', "(Now, now... Her smarts just manifest in ways we<br/>don't quite understand. I'm...sure that's it.)")
('Rebecca', 'EYAAAGH?!')
('Rebecca', "...Oh, Van! Don't scare me like that! I thought my<br/>heart was gonna jump right out of my chest...")
('Van', "Yo. Pullin' another all-nighter?")
('Van', "If you're that jumpy, you're probably better off just<br/>goin' to bed.")
('Rebecca', "I-I just thought...you might've been a customer...")
('Van', "And THAT'S how you greet a customer?")
('Rebecca', "Well...yes. Customers are scary. People are scary.<br/>Outside of a few of the regulars here, I just can't<br/>handle them.")
('Rebecca', "Wh-Wh-Who's that? That girl, over there...")
('Agnès', "Er, don't mind me! I'm like Van's assistant.")
('Rebecca', 'O-Okay.')
('Rebecca', "(Wait, she's not scaring me? That's...weird.)")
('Agnès', 'So, erm...')
('Rebecca', 'O-Oh, sorry. Just thinking.')
('Rebecca', "I don't envy you. Being Van's assistant<br/>sounds tough...")
('Rebecca', 'Having to go out in the sun and...and TALK<br/>to people... Do you have to WORK with them, too?')
('Rebecca', "I could never do that... D-Don't push yourself too<br/>hard out there, okay? It's hard work!")
('Agnès', "I...appreciate the concern. I'll keep myself in check.")
('Agnès', "(I feel as though she's a bit TOO worried about me.)")
('Van', "(Projection. She speaks machine—real genius<br/>like that. But she can't handle people to save her life.)")
('Van', 'At any rate, can I count on you to keep her Xipha<br/>spick and span?')
('Rebecca', 'Roger that.')
('Rebecca', 'We have this Xipha-exclusive tuning device from the<br/>Verne Company.')
('Rebecca', "You can have this... It's, umm, a token of<br/>our partnership.")
('System', 'Received <br/>.')
('Agnès', 'Oh! Are you sure?')
('Rebecca', "Uh-huh. I just happened to make a few, and we don't<br/>have them here yet anyway.")
('Rebecca', "There's not much you can do with them, but they<br/>should still help you out.")
('Rebecca', "Oh, but before you can use them, you'll probably need<br/>to unlock some slots.")
('Agnès', 'Slots?')
('Rebecca', "You need an open slot to install an orbment in.<br/>The more slots you've unlocked, the more orbments<br/>you can use.")
('Rebecca', 'Wanna give it a shot?')
('Van', 'Sure, sounds good.')
('Rebecca', 'Oh, right, you need sepith to open slots.')
('Rebecca', 'Here, lemme give you back some of the sepith<br/>I borrowed.')
('System', 'Received 30 each of various types of sepith.')
('Van', "Oh, you sure? You don't have to if you needed that.")
('Van', "But if you're okay with it, that works out nicely.<br/>Let's get crackin'.")
('System', 'Select [Open Slot], then find an unopened slot and<br/>unlock it.')
('Van', 'Really appreciate it, Rebecca.')
('Rebecca', "Oh, it's no big deal... You're always helping me<br/>out, anyway. I needed to return the favor.")
('Rebecca', 'If you ever need work done on your Xipha, or you just<br/>need some new quartz, feel free to drop by.')
('Rebecca', "It's nice having someone I can talk to... I can handle<br/>you and Van just fine.")
('Rebecca', "But not the outside world. There are too many<br/>p-people out there... Here is where it's safe.")
('Van', "Eh, don't beat yourself up over it. Everybody's<br/>built different. Long as it makes you happy, I don't<br/>see a problem with it.")
('Rebecca', "To think it's been a decade since I started<br/>taking projects... I still get giddy when I find<br/>something new to shine up nice and pretty...")
('Agnès', "(...Wait, it's been ten YEARS since she went outside?<br/>Uh... Okay, that kind of is a problem, actually.)")
('Chris', "Oh, thank Aidios you're all okay!")
('Chris', "We've been stockpiling up whatever we can find, just<br/>in case we need it around the neighborhood.")
('Chris', "We haven't been able to get back in contact<br/>with Dad...")
('Chris', "...but I know he's safe. He has to be! He's too tough<br/>for this to take him out.")
('Chris', "We'll make sure Old Town is safe and secure.<br/>Just leave it to us!")
('Van', "Sounds good. Just don't bite off more than you<br/>can chew! We're here if you need us.")
('Feri', "We'll keep an eye out for your father, don't worry!")
('Chris', "I still haven't been able to get in touch with Dad,<br/>but...I know he's somewhere out there! He's gotta<br/>be okay!")
('Chris', 'Stay safe, guys!')
('Chris', 'Geesh, Dad finally comes home, and he just dumps<br/>off parts and bounces right back out!')
('Chris', 'I swear, he treats his own house like a storage shed.<br/>News flash: we live here, too!')
('Chris', "I wanna track him down and get him to clean up after<br/>himself, but I'm up to my neck in festival work...")
('Chris', "E-Er, sorry! Don't mind me, I'm just...venting my<br/>frustrations a little.")
('Chris', 'This time, he went from the free cities all the way to<br/>the Molujia Archipelago, just to get his hands on<br/>some vintages.')
('Chris', "He's really committed, I'll give him that.")
('Chris', "I guess I can't complain—now we get to eat dinner<br/>together for the first time in ages.")
('Chris', "All right, what've we got here... Burned-out lights in<br/>the 10th District high street...")
('Chris', "District 2 has a building with faulty HVAC...<br/>Go figure I'd have to trudge all the way out there.<br/>I'll tackle that after lunch.")
('Chris', 'This time of year is always a mess. All the holidays<br/>and celebrations bring in ALL the jobs...')
('Chris', "It'd sure be nice if Rebecca could help with festival<br/>prep out in the field, but...")
('Chris', "...well, that's a no go, for obvious reasons.")
('Chris', 'She can at least talk to people once she feels<br/>comfortable around them...')
('Chris', "...but when she meets someone for the first time, it's<br/>like she's seeing a ghost.")
('Chris', 'Why did this have to happen...? Those were people<br/>we knew, people we worked with at the workshop<br/>over there...')
('Chris', "Just... Thank Aidios Kaina made it. She was here in<br/>Edith at the time...but I can't imagine how she feels.")
('Chris', "And there's still no word from Dad...")
('Chris', "I don't think he was in Creil, so I'm hoping he's<br/>okay, but... I just feel terrible.")
('Chris', 'So Rebecca took this online entrance exam thing for<br/>Basel University...')
('Chris', "...and she got a perfect score. Which is a waste,<br/>because she's never GOING to Basel University.")
('Chris', "That would require setting foot outside her<br/>house, and she hasn't done that in ten years.")
('Chris', "Haha... She's really turned over a new leaf.")
('Chris', 'The other day, she was looking out her window with<br/>some binoculars and just taking in the sights.')
('Chris', "I can't thank you enough, Quatre. You've really<br/>helped her out.")
('Quatre', "Er, no need to thank me. I'm just happy to see her so<br/>interested in my work.")
('Chris', 'As you should be!')
('Chris', 'I hope this helps bring her out of her shell, if only a<br/>little bit.')
('Chris', 'I hope this helps bring her out of her shell, if only a<br/>little bit.')
('Chris', 'Feel free to drop by anytime!')
('Chris', "Rebecca's been talking about trying to get over<br/>her anxiety... Maybe this is the year she finally gets<br/>some fresh air.")
('Chris', "To think it's been ten years since she went outside...<br/>I can barely remember it. I really worry for<br/>her, sometimes.")
('Chris', "It's just, that anxiety makes it hard for her to interact<br/>with people. That's the big thing...")
('Chris', "I just don't know what to do. I don't wanna coddle<br/>her too much, but all the same, she really can't carry<br/>on like this...")
('Chris', "*sigh* But maybe I'm just getting too worked up<br/>about it myself.")
('Chris', "Oh, right! Almost forgot, that new Kitty Engine<br/>update drops today. I'd better get that installed.")
('Chris', 'It has this secret mode you can toggle, and it lets you<br/>do some really nifty stuff.')
('Chris', 'Oh, Van, Risette? Thanks for the other day.')
('Chris', "I'm not too familiar with Xiphas and those kinds of<br/>machines, so thanks a bunch for tuning it for me!")
('Risette', 'My pleasure. I do appreciate opportunities to discuss<br/>these devices in-depth.')
('Risette', "Shard engineering especially is very esoteric in nature,<br/>so it can be difficult to digest. I'd be happy to help<br/>you, should you find things unclear.")
('Risette', "And whatever I can't answer is a main office<br/>call away.")
('Chris', "Thanks...! Man, I knew Marduk was high tech, but<br/>that's just something else.")
('Chris', "Guess you can't judge a book by its cover, huh?")
('Chris', "I can't wait to learn more! And I appreciate you<br/>getting along with my sister. Stop by every now and<br/>then, yeah?")
('Risette', 'Of course. It would be my pleasure.')
('Chris', "Man, Marduk is just something else. They're way<br/>ahead of the curve with their new shard tech...")
('Chris', "Now that I think about it, your primary core is a<br/>Marduk make, isn't it?")
('Chris', "I probably don't have access to the documentation for<br/>that, but I can take a look at it and see what I can do.")
('Chris', 'By all means, swing by if you get the chance!')
('Chris', 'Feel free to check out our inventory. We buy<br/>spare parts and other junk, so we might have<br/>something you like.')
('Chris', "People sell their old, defective stuff for cheap all the<br/>time—but they're not defective for long after Rebecca<br/>and I get our hands on 'em.")
('Chris', 'It just makes the checkbook a pain. Sometimes we<br/>just harvest parts without fixing the whole thing, and<br/>then we have nothing to show for the purchase.')
('Chris', "I have to do a lot of the heavy lifting, especially<br/>dealing with customers. Rebecca's really difficult<br/>to manage.")
('Chris', "Rebecca's a mechanical whiz, bless her heart, but she<br/>just doesn't know how to work with actual people.<br/>It's like she speaks a different language.")
('Chris', 'So I get stuck with the front-facing repair work...that<br/>is to say, most of our jobs. *sigh*')
('Chris', "Dad's been good friends with Goddard over in Creil<br/>Village for a while now.")
('Chris', "That's how we got to know Kaina. She's a good girl.")
('Chris', "I hear her training's going well, to boot. It makes me<br/>wanna get good myself!")
('Chris', 'Oh, actually, we got a letter from Dad the other day.')
('Chris', "He says that he's about ready to come home, but<br/>I dunno... I'll believe him when I see him.")
('Van', "He opened up the shop himself, didn't he? I don't<br/>think I've ever actually met the guy.")
('Chris', "Yeah. He's always out on some trip somewhere, so it's<br/>not often you see him around.")
('Chris', "And then my sister... *sigh* The two of them just<br/>do whatever they want and there's no talking them<br/>out of it.")
('Chris', "The old man should be fine out there, it's just...really<br/>frustrating when he stops sending letters.")
('Chris', "*sigh* Where's he gallivanted off to now? I wish he'd<br/>keep in touch instead of just dropping off the radar all<br/>the time.")
('Chris', "That's the guy who dropped by the other week.<br/>Always nice to see a satisfied customer!")
('Chris', "I reckon we're about the only place in the capital that<br/>can fix this much damage.")
('Chris', 'I wish Rebecca could handle those customers directly,<br/>but, well...yeah. I gotta be the middleman.')
('Chris', 'Yo, Van! What brings you by today?')
('Van', "'Sup. I got me a part-timer, so I'm here to bring her<br/>up to speed on resources.")
('Van', 'This place is super useful, Agnès. You come here if<br/>you need any technical work done.')
('Agnès', 'Ah, so this is the shop you mentioned before. I see.')
('Agnès', 'Does the workshop service orbments, too?')
('Chris', 'Yup! Me and my sister, Rebecca, are<br/>orbment technicians.')
('Chris', "She's way better at it than I am, though, so you can<br/>leave that work to her.")
('Chris', "I'm more the shop's manager than anything, really.")
('Van', "This place is your bargain bin outlet for<br/>mechanical stuff. They'll repair 'em, too.")
('Chris', 'And not just machines. We buy and sell just about<br/>anything we can get our hands on.')
('Chris', "Feel free to take a look around, if you're interested!")
('Agnès', 'Certainly!')
('Chris', "Admittedly my sister's kinda...out there, so I handle<br/>customers, payment, that stuff.")
('Chris', "But you'll probably be fine with her. She's used to<br/>you, Van, so she'll take your work on, no prob.")
('Van', 'Good to know.')
('Chris', 'Wait, you know Yimai, too? Hah, I had no idea!')
('Chris', "Yimai's a little pushy at times, not gonna lie...")
('Chris', "...but they're always coming in and buying the stuff<br/>nobody else would, so I can't complain.")
('Chris', 'Oh, by the way, I heard you were talking business or<br/>something earlier. What was that all about?')
('Van', 'Yeah, we were talking about the old man. He was an<br/>odd fellow, but my assistant here pieced his puzzle<br/>together for me.')
('Agnès', "Oh, don't sell yourself short, heehee.")
('Chris', "Wow. That's Arkride Solutions for you, huh?")
('Chris', 'I gotta keep studying and getting better—sometimes<br/>Rebecca gets overloaded with stuff. I gotta pick up<br/>the slack!')
('Chris', 'I can tackle your simple jobs, so drop on in whenever<br/>you need work.')
('Chris', "You've probably seen how, umm...unique my sister is.<br/>It's kinda hard to miss it.")
('Chris', "But she's impossibly talented with machines. She'll do<br/>good work for you, you just gotta look past her quirks.")
('Chris', '...Wait, what?! You wanna go to Basel? Seriously?!')
('Rebecca', "I do! I wanna go to the Basel Institute! I wanna do<br/>the kind of work that Quatre's doing!")
('Rebecca', 'I can learn more about engineering, and, and take<br/>classes with professors, and make new things, and...!')
('Rebecca', "I can sell the stuff I make, then the...the Verne<br/>Company will hire me. Then I'll have to<br/>do...INTERVIEWS.")
('Rebecca', "On second thought, scratch that. I'm too far gone.<br/>I can't talk with normies like that, I'll just... I'll DIE.")
('Chris', 'Baby steps, here, baby steps. Just focus on the smaller<br/>things for now.')
('Rebecca', "I finally got in touch with Kaina. She said she doesn't<br/>know anything about the explosion, though...")
('Rebecca', 'Oh, you two...')
('Quatre', "Correct me if I'm wrong, but you were gathering<br/>intel, if memory serves?")
('Chris', 'Yeah. We got in touch with Kaina, she was here in<br/>the capital at the time...')
('Chris', "...but she said she didn't have any leads. We're<br/>just...stumped.")
('Quatre', 'I see... Thank heavens there were at least<br/>some survivors.')
('Quatre', "If I remember correctly, she's an acquaintance<br/>of yours?")
('Chris', 'Yeah. Goddard, over in Creil Village... He helped us<br/>out a bunch over the years.')
('Chris', 'But...')
('Rebecca', "*sniffle* I just don't get it... Why...?")
('Agnès', '(Rebecca... Chris...)')
('Quatre', "(We must... We WILL stop them. I won't rest until<br/>that weapon is dead and buried!)")
('Rebecca', 'Wh-What happened? Did time really just stop?!')
('Chris', 'What the hell is THAT?!')
('Van', 'Okay, good! There you are!')
('Chris', "Van! Thank Aidios you're here. Is everybody okay?")
('Rebecca', "I-I'd been hiding, but I just got so curious about<br/>this phenomenon...")
('Rebecca', "A-And now I'm... I'm outside! I-I-I can't move!")
('Van', "Now really ain't the time for walkin' and gawkin'.")
('Van', "Gettin' real dicey out here. Shack up and ride it out<br/>for now!")
('Chris', 'O-Okay!')
('Rebecca', 'Be careful, everyone!')
('Rebecca', 'Oh, right! Take this with you! I just remembered I<br/>had this on me.')
('System', 'Obtained ◆〇〇〇〇〇.')
('Van', 'Much thanks!')
('Shizuna', 'Well, shall we?')
('Kincaid', "Don't be hasty, here.")
('Cao', 'Do exercise caution.')
('Filenkov', "Oh? Now, didn't I see you on my last trip...?")
('Van', "Oh, hey. Didn't think you were from<br/>the neighborhood.")
('Filenkov', "Indeed I am. I've actually heard about you in the<br/>letters my kids send me.")
('Filenkov', "You're a spriggan, yes? I hope they're not too big a<br/>thorn in your side, haha.")
('Filenkov', 'To live and breathe metal—that is the way of<br/>the repairman.')
('Filenkov', 'I turn my back for one second, and my kids are<br/>full-fledged tradesmen! Or...well, I guess I turned my<br/>back for a year, actually. Wahaha!')
('Van', "(Huh? Didn't I bump into this guy in Longlai?<br/>Oración, too, actually...)")
('Van', "(Hmm? Didn't I run into this ol' fart in Oración?)")
('Filenkov', "I'm hooome! How've you kids been doing?")
('Rebecca', 'D-D-Dad?!')
('Rebecca', '...Wait, did you always look like that?')
('Filenkov', "I...I'm hurt! How could you forget your dear<br/>father's face? I-It hasn't been that long, has it?")
('Chris', 'Well, you WERE gone for a whole year, Dad.')
('Chris', "You sent that letter saying you'd be home soon...three<br/>months ago. Where the heck were you?")
('Chris', 'Would it really have killed you to keep in touch<br/>more often? I mean, seriously, three months of<br/>nothing, as if you just died or... *grumble*')
('Filenkov', "(My boy's wise beyond his years. He sounds like a<br/>parent already...)")
('Rebecca', "Maybe if you got us some souvenirs, that'd sweeten<br/>the deal. Or let us keep some of your loot, maybe.")
('Filenkov', "My word... You kids are harsh. But I suppose I do<br/>owe it to you for being away so long. C'est la vie!")
('Filenkov', "Now, gather round for Papa Filenkov's Show<br/>and Tell! I've got quite the assortment for you today,<br/>curated from my year-long trip!")
('Rebecca', 'WHOOOOOA!')
('Van', "(Apples didn't fall far from that tree, huh?)")
('Sheena', "Mom, Dad! I thought I'd never see you again!")
('Sheena', 'Thank you...! Thank you so much!')
('Sheena', 'This is like one big nightmare...but I know you can<br/>fix it! Be careful out there, okay?!')
('Sheena', "Oh, Harry... You're just now telling me you wanna<br/>get lunch at the stalls?!")
('Sheena', "Why didn't you tell me that sooner? You big...<br/>dummy head!")
('Harry', 'Sorry! But I swear I can eat enough for two!')
('Sheena', "(I know that... That's why I made extra for you...)")
('Sheena', '(It was supposed to be a gift for the<br/>Revolution Festival... I worked so hard on it!)')
('Sheena', "Well, heehee. Have as much food as you want, then.<br/>Eat until you can't walk. I insist!")
('Harry', "Wh-What's gotten into you?!")
('Mark', "She's really scary when she smiles like that...")
('Sheena', "*sigh* Harry had to go and ruin everything.<br/>Why can't he just... *grumble*")
('Sheena', "But I guess the food won't go to waste, at least, if<br/>everyone will be there to eat it.")
('Sheena', "It's just, can you blame me? I worked so hard to make<br/>it for him...!")
('Sheena', "History is just... I dunno, I don't like it.")
('Sheena', 'But then, my mom and dad named me after Sheena<br/>Dirke, of all people!')
('Sheena', 'How am I supposed to fill her shoes? I just wanna be<br/>an ordinary girl...')
('Sheena', 'Why did Mom and Dad have to name me after her?')
('Gin', "You'll stick with that name and you'll LIKE it, you<br/>ungrateful little...!")
('Sheena', 'Eep! S-Sorry!')
('Sheena', '(*sigh* I wish I had a name like a book character, not<br/>some old history thing.)')
('Sheena', "(But Gin makes history really interesting. Her stories<br/>don't feel like a class at all.)")
('Sheena', "(I'll try and pay attention today.)")
('Sheena', "Harry's a real big dummy...but sometimes that's a<br/>good thing. Heehee!")
('Sheena', 'Hmm... Is it just me, or have I seen you before?')
('Sheena', "You look really familiar, but... Nah, I think I'm just<br/>remembering wrong.")
('Judith', "I...can't say I've met you before, haha!<br/>(Man, this girl's sharp!)")
('Sheena', "(That's... That's a new face. I've never seen anything<br/>like that before.) Yeah, I think I'm just mixing you up<br/>with someone else.")
('Van', '(You kinda phoned it in there, felt like.)')
('Agnès', '(Ah, haha...)')
('Sheena', "I feel like Harry's made me...calmer? Older? He's so<br/>hyper, I sorta balance him out.")
('Sheena', "He just goes on and on about everything...but<br/>that's okay! I'll talk with him some more today.")
('Sheena', "Mr. Hawker! It's been forever since I saw you!")
('Hawker', 'Heya, Sheena! Sorry I had to saddle you folks with<br/>Harry for that whole month.')
('Sheena', "It's okay! We got along fine.")
('Sheena', "It got kinda tough sometimes...but I'm a big girl now,<br/>so I could handle it!")
('Hawker', "(I leave for a month, and Sheena's a completely<br/>different girl.)")
('Hawker', '(Kids these days... Haha. They grow up so fast.)')
('Hawker', "Oh, right! Guess who's got some souvenirs for you?")
('Hawker', "Let's head on back, okay? I'll walk you home.")
('Sheena', "Okay! I'm sure my mom and dad wanna say hi, too.")
('Sheena', "O-Oh, my goodness! It's... It's...!")
('Yumé', 'Cool, right?!')
('Sheena', "It's so CUUUTE!")
('Mark', 'Wait, cute? What?')
('Sheena', "I've always wanted to become a witch! And what's a<br/>witch without a familiar?")
('Sheena', "Oh, this pupper's just perfect—strong, clever, and<br/>loyal, too!")
('Mark', "...I think she's broken.")
('Harry', "Hey, c'mon, lemme have a turn! I wanna pet the<br/>dog, too!")
('Sheena', "Heehee... Oh, I can't stand the cuteness. It'd be nice<br/>to have a fluffier one, but this'll do just fine!")
('Harry', 'Harry to Sheena! Are you listening?!')
('Sheena', 'Harry and I have been getting the groceries<br/>together recently.')
('Sheena', "He's really strong, so he carries most of the bags.<br/>*sigh* I'm kinda jealous.")
('Sheena', "But I make up for it in smarts. He always forgets<br/>what to buy at the store, so I've got that on him!")
('Sheena', 'Listen up, newbies! I have a mission for you!')
('Sheena', 'We have a, uh...a deserter in our midst! Your orders<br/>are to find them and bring them to me!')
('Sheena', "Their punishment: we'll TICKLE them to death!<br/>Mwahahahaaa!")
('Sheena', "Your target's name is Étoile! Don't let them get away!")
('Harry', " Yes, ma'am!")
('Van', "Wow, you guys're really gettin' into the roles, huh?<br/>Like little movie stars.")
('Sheena', "(Shh! The best part's coming up!)")
('Agnès', "(You're quite the actress, Sheena! Heehee.)")
('Sheena', "(Honestly, I'm kinda tired of running around...<br/>We've been playing sooooo much lately.)")
('Sheena', "(And the next book in my favorite series just<br/>came out! Now I can sneak away and read it while<br/>they're out playing.)")
('Risette', "(I see... So this 'mission' is little more than a front.)")
('Van', '(Huh, you make it make sense when you say it<br/>like that.)')
('Sheena', "Dad! You can be so useless sometimes. I'll talk<br/>to Mom, she'll know what to do!")
('Sheena', "I know Harry can't just be by himself, and I hang out<br/>with him a lot already, but still...")
('Sheena', "I-It just doesn't feel right!")
('Sheena', "'A word I learned recently,' huh...? I wonder what<br/>to pick!")
('Sheena', "I pick up a lot of new words from books, so<br/>that's easy. But maybe I should go with<br/>something different? Maybe more romantic? Hmm...")
('Harry', "Your song's kinda hard to sing... It makes my teeth<br/>all weird.")
('Sheena', 'Can you be quiet, Harry?')
('Sheena', "Harry hasn't had a mom since he was really little...")
('Sheena', "And Mr. Hawker always has work, so it's hard for<br/>them both...")
('Sheena', "I guess compared to that, I have it easy...so I<br/>shouldn't complain about having to look after him.")
('Sheena', "Heehee, they both look so happy when<br/>they're asleep...")
('Sheena', '*sigh* What makes boys so carefree?')
('Sheena', "Oh, hi, Feri! Wait, if you're here, does that mean...?")
('Feri', "Yup! I'm officially working part time!")
('Feri', "First objective: scouting Edith's terrain<br/>and chokepoints. Sniper spots are big in these close<br/>quarters—gotta check for those, too!")
('Sheena', 'Umm, maybe you could relax a little bit...')
('Sheena', "(She's so cool, though! A real life warrior!)")
('Feri', 'Are you guys playing hide and seek? Cool, heehee!<br/>Just be careful, okay?')
('Sheena', 'Uh-huh, we will! You guys take care, too!')
('Sheena', "*sigh* Yumé's just too strong... I have to pull out my<br/>ace in the hole!")
('Sheena', "Harry, let's team u... Wait, where'd he go?<br/>He's gone!")
('Sheena', "He's up to something, I can just tell... I have a bad<br/>feeling about this.")
('Sheena', "Hi, Van! Who's the girl with you?")
('Van', "Yo. She's my new part-timer.")
('Agnès', 'My name is Agnès Claudel. Pleased to meet you!')
('Sheena', 'Huh?! Agnès?!')
('Agnès', "U-Umm, yes? That's my name.")
('Sheena', "This! Right here! I was just re-reading<br/>'Sunshine Agnès'!")
('Sheena', 'You have the same name as her!')
('Van', 'Oh, yeah. That book really blew up a few years back.')
('Agnès', 'Ahh, that takes me back. I quite enjoyed that novel<br/>myself, growing up.')
('Agnès', "She's a girl with an icy exterior, but she's strong and<br/>dashing all the same...")
('Agnès', '...and I still remember the ending well. It really stays<br/>with you.')
('Sheena', 'Right?! And her whole backstory is just sooo cool!')
('Sheena', "I just love how, umm...ambiguous! That's the word!<br/>I love how ambiguous her story is.")
('Sheena', "They don't really talk about the ending much, like...<br/>What happens on the bus at the end? It's<br/>so mysterious!")
('Van', '(Hah. Went and flipped her switch, Agnès.)')
('Agnès', "(Reading is a wonderful hobby to have at her age.<br/>I think we'll get along just fine!)")
('Sheena', 'I was just finishing Sunshine Agnès, and then I meet<br/>someone with the same name? What are the odds?!')
('Sheena', 'I wish I could chat more, but I can feel a tantrum<br/>coming on. Harry gets cranky right about now.')
('Sheena', '*sigh* Harry lives next door to me.')
('Sheena', "He's a big dummy, but he's not BAD... Just, he's had<br/>it kinda rough. I help Mr. Hawker look after him.")
('Sheena', "Harry's a real bonehead, but I know it's been rough<br/>for him. And we ARE next-door neighbors, after all.")
('Sheena', 'He really gets along with Mark, so I see him a<br/>lot anyway.')
('Sheena', "...But if he tries anything funny with me, I'm gonna<br/>wreck him.")
('Sheena', 'Oh! Hi, Van!')
('Van', "Yo... Err, wait. What are you doin' here?")
('Sheena', 'Oh, heehee, nothing at all! Just looking for Harry.')
('Sheena', 'I went to go read my favorite novel, but there was a<br/>little comic book there instead! I just wanna talk to<br/>him about it, I promise! ♪')
('Van', "Hoo, boy. Don't terrorize him TOO much, 'kay?")
('Sheena', 'Yeah, yeah! Heehee!')
('Agnès', '(Van seems quite popular with the children here...<br/>Interesting.)')
('Sheena', 'Harry? Come on out!')
('Sheena', "C'mon, pleeease? You don't want me to start tearing<br/>up your comic book, do you? ♪")
('Hawker', 'So, Harry was up to his old pranking games<br/>again, huh?')
('Hawker', "Then after pulling one over you, he flew the coop<br/>on his bike? Hahaha! That kid's got no shame!")
('Sheena', "I know, right?! I wasn't about to take that lying<br/>down, so I threw a bucket at him. And it landed<br/>clean on his head!")
('Sheena', "But get this: He STILL got away—even though he<br/>couldn't see where he was going! Like, how?!")
('Hawker', "Hahaha! I'm not even sure who the victim is anymore!")
('Hawker', "In all seriousness, though, thanks for keeping him<br/>company. You're the whole reason Harry doesn't<br/>feel lonely.")
('Sheena', "Oh, umm... Don't mention it, sir! You can always<br/>count on me to keep an eye on him and Mark!")
('Robinson', "Sorry I'm late. I was talkin' to Hawker about<br/>some stuff.")
('Robinson', "So, he's actually goin' on a business trip soon.<br/>He's gonna be in Oración for a month.")
('Sheena', 'Really? A whole month?')
('Robinson', "Yup. So, Harry will be living with us while his<br/>dad's away. You don't mind that, do you?")
('Sheena', 'Wha...? HUUUH?!')
('Sheena', "B-B-But we only have one kid's room! What're we<br/>gonna do?!")
('Robinson', "Oh, don't be so shy about it. You two are always<br/>having sleepovers anyway!")
('Robinson', 'We might as well be family at this point. Now that I<br/>think about it, do you two still take baths together?')
('Sheena', "That's not the same! And we stopped doing that<br/>years ago!")
(11119, "My word, this is incredible! It's good as new!")
(11119, "This watch was a memento from my father...<br/>I couldn't bear to part with it.")
(11119, 'Is the young lady over there to thank? Might I offer a<br/>word of gratitude to her?')
('Chris', "She's got her head buried in another project right<br/>now, but I'll pass that on to her.")
(11119, 'I see, she must be quite busy. At any rate, you two<br/>have my gratitude!')
(11119, "I must say, I'm shocked that they accepted my<br/>request so quickly.")
(11119, 'I had feared that this watch was a lost cause after it<br/>got ran over by that car...')
(11119, "I know it'll take time, but I'll wait as long as I need to.<br/>Anything to see that watch fixed!")
(11119, 'I heard there was this shop in Old Town that<br/>could repair just about anything.')
(11119, 'I wonder if they can fix my watch. It got run over by a<br/>car the other day...')
(11119, "Well, I suppose it wouldn't hurt to ask.")
(11119, "I came here on a friend's recommendation—they told<br/>me there was a shop here that could fix just<br/>about anything.")
(11119, "Now that I'm here, though, I dare say this place has<br/>me charmed! Most old streets aren't preserved quite<br/>this well. Maybe I'll look around for a bit.")
('Brenda', "We've got food here, so if need be, we can make the<br/>rounds and keep the neighborhood stocked up.")
('Brenda', 'You folks best be careful, okay? Come back in<br/>one piece!')
('Brenda', "Aye, welcome! The festival's made us all busy<br/>bees here.")
('Brenda', "You doing the rounds, too? I imagine you're buzzing<br/>around town for work.")
('Brenda', 'Make sure you find time to take a breather! Hang<br/>in there!')
('Brenda', 'Montmart was completely booked tonight, I heard.')
('Brenda', "I'm glad you guys get to relax, now that the mafia's<br/>died down a bit.")
('Brenda', "I get the feeling this year's festival is gonna be a real<br/>barn burner, so you gotta rest up and recharge your<br/>batteries while you can!")
('Brenda', 'Now then, that should get me through the festival.')
('Brenda', '...What IS Eddy up to, actually?')
('Brenda', "He's been going out a lot recently. He said he had<br/>some kind of idea, but he wouldn't tell me what.")
('Brenda', "Eddy came back home the other day, but he told me<br/>he's 'just crashing here.' Turned his nose up to<br/>helping out around the house.")
('Brenda', "What's the boy thinking? He's just roaming the<br/>streets without a thought in that head of his.")
('Brenda', "*sigh* Well, I've tried all I can. I guess I have to just<br/>let him be.")
('Brenda', "Anyhow, if there's anything you need, I can ring you<br/>up here!")
('Brenda', "With the festival coming up, it's a good idea to buy<br/>your gifts and other stuff early. You never know when<br/>the rush will hit.")
('Brenda', 'So the mafia were behind all that, were they?<br/>Aidios alive, what is this world coming to...?')
('Brenda', "Don't let your guard down. I know you deal with a lot<br/>of those types.")
('Brenda', 'And I worry for the girls in your group, out on<br/>those streets. You folks be careful, all right?')
('Van', "We'll be fine, don't worry.")
('Agnès', '(Hmm? Van?)')
('Brenda', "I'm so sorry... I wish I could get him to stop causing<br/>so much trouble.")
('Brenda', "He's not as destructive as he used to be, at the<br/>very least...")
('Brenda', "Now if only he'd listen to what his old lady says, I<br/>could rest easy at night.")
('Brenda', "I heard Eddy left that gang he was roaming around<br/>with. That's a good start...")
('Brenda', "...but he's still dinking around Aidios knows where.<br/>Just what is that boy up to?")
('Brenda', "The next time I see him, I'm gonna screw that head<br/>of his back on straight!")
('Agnès', "(That doesn't really motivate him to come home,<br/>does it?)")
('Van', '(Not much we can do but be an ear for<br/>their troubles.)')
('Brenda', "*sigh* What's Eddy gone and got himself into now?<br/>I heard he was in some kind of incident!")
('Brenda', "How much does he want to make his poor<br/>mom worry? I just wish he'd come back home and<br/>talk to me, for once in his life...")
('Brenda', "...though I know he wouldn't listen to a damn thing I<br/>have to say.")
('Brenda', 'I hate to ask, but if he gets himself into<br/>trouble again...')
('Brenda', "...can you set him straight for me? I just can't get<br/>through to him anymore.")
('Brenda', '*sigh* Where did I go wrong...?')
('Brenda', "Oh, sorry, it's nothing. Just thinking about that child<br/>of mine...")
('Brenda', "If I hear he's causing trouble, I'm finding him and<br/>dragging him back home myself.")
('Agnès', "(Brenda's son seems to be quite the handful...)")
('Van', "(Yeah, he's had issues for a while now. Not our place<br/>to butt in, though.)")
('Risette', '(I understand her concerns... I can only hope they<br/>resolve their troubles.)')
('Brenda', 'My husband died when the boy was still young, so I<br/>had to raise him all on my own.')
('Brenda', "I know it was tough for him, but I just don't<br/>understand what led him to all this...")
('Brenda', "Bah, I'm thinking too much! I've got work to do,<br/>damn it! Just gotta get it off my mind... You need<br/>anything, let me know!")
('Brenda', "It's about time for my fall stock to come in, so I'm<br/>getting my hotpot specials ready in advance.")
('Brenda', "Oh, Van! Doing your rounds even in the rain?<br/>That's a good backbone you've got.")
('Brenda', "I'm happy to have you looking out for us all, but take<br/>care of yourself, too, yeah?")
('Van', "Don't worry, I will. Thanks.")
('Van', "(Got a couple orders I wanna get squared away, but<br/>they can wait. I've got time.)")
('Brenda', "I'm sorry you had to see that, folks...")
('Brenda', "Eddy's just too much of a handful for me these days.<br/>He's all in on this rebellious phase.")
('Brenda', "That boy needs to pull himself together. He hangs<br/>with the wrong crowd and he's gonna learn a<br/>hard lesson.")
('Brenda', "I'm sorry about my son...")
('Brenda', "I'll make sure to give him an earful later.<br/>Just...please, try to ignore him for now.")
('Brenda', "If anything strikes your fancy, I'll ring you up in<br/>a jiffy.")
('Brenda', 'Right, time to close up shop. I gotta take inventory<br/>and then put everything away.')
('Brenda', "*sigh* Just what does that boy get up to? Night after<br/>night, he's out doing Aidios knows what...")
('Brenda', "Oh! Hah, uhh, don't mind me. If you find something<br/>you like, lemme know!")
('Van', 'Cool, thanks.')
('Van', "(If I recall, her kid's eighteen-ish... Probably best for<br/>me to keep my nose outta that.)")
('Feri', "Hello, ma'am!")
('Brenda', 'Well, hello, Feri! You look chipper today.')
('Brenda', "Oh, right, I was meaning to tell you. So I went and<br/>ordered some of that Central Eastern spice you told<br/>me about the other day—that za'atar stuff.")
('Brenda', "I gave some to Victor, too. It'll be neat to see what he<br/>does with it!")
('Feri', "Whoa, really? Thank you so much! I kinda miss home<br/>cooking, so I'm really looking forward to that.")
('Brenda', "I totally get that. At your age, especially, it's easy to<br/>miss home.")
('Brenda', "If you're ever feeling lonely, drop on by. I'd be more<br/>than happy to chat with you!")
('Feri', 'Roger, heehee!')
('Van', "(Man. I thought you two might take a while to fit in,<br/>but you're like chameleons.)")
('Agnès', '(Well, can you blame us? The townsfolk are just so<br/>amiable here.)')
('Brenda', 'You sure are a tough cookie, going out and<br/>working on a holiday, Agnès!')
('Brenda', "Just be careful, okay? Make sure they don't get too<br/>tuckered out, Van!")
('Van', "Don't sweat it.")
('Agnès', 'Of course. Take care, Brenda!')
('Brenda', "Well, if it isn't Van! I really do owe you for your help.")
('Brenda', "Thanks to you, I haven't been gouged a single mira!<br/>It's such a relief, seriously.")
('Van', "Good to hear. Nothin' gets by the ol' Van.")
('Van', "You run into anything else, lemme know. I'll give you<br/>the neighborhood discount.")
('Brenda', 'Haha! You really know how to keep your<br/>customers loyal!')
('Brenda', "Oh, before I forget! I told myself I'd hand this to you<br/>the next time you dropped by. Here, take it!")
('System', 'Received two <br/>s.')
('Van', "Hey, thanks for the tip! These definitely won't go<br/>to waste.")
('Brenda', "Good! Oh, and would this lady here be your<br/>new part-timer? I've heard a good deal about<br/>her already.")
('Brenda', "Isn't she just adorable? Now, I'm not sure how your<br/>paths crossed, young lady, but I wish you the best of<br/>luck under his wing!")
('Agnès', "Er, thank you! I'll do my best!")
('Brenda', "I'm your one-stop shop for groceries and<br/>general goods. You want it, I've got it!")
('Brenda', "I imagine I'll be seeing you pretty often, now that<br/>you're working at his office.")
('Brenda', "You're always welcome here! Drop on by whenever<br/>you need anything.")
('Eddy', 'Just, umm...l-leave the old lady to me! And the rest of<br/>the neighborhood, too.')
('Eddy', "I'm actually in pretty good shape, so...d-don't write<br/>me off! I'll keep the neighborhood safe, okay?!")
('Van', "Hah! You're young and fit, I trust ya!")
('Eddy', "Wassup, wassup! Come get'cher—GAH! You?!")
('Van', "Yo, my sweet tooth's tingling. You got yourself a<br/>stand now?")
('Eddy', "It's—you—no! It's just like a...street...vendor,<br/>sorta thing!")
('Van', "Don't have to be shy about it. Little while ago, you<br/>were some punk crawlin' the streets.")
('Van', "And now look at you: you've got an honest job!<br/>No shame in that.")
('Eddy', "D-Don't mock me, you piece of shit!")
('Eddy', "And it's NOT a stand! It's just like a vendor thing!")
('Eddy', "Don't lump me in with the rest! I'm savin' up money<br/>so I can finally move out of that old hag's house!<br/>Give her some...peace and quiet, I guess.")
('Agnès', "Heehee... That's admirable of you.")
('Feri', "Really? That's kinda nice of you!")
('Aaron', "Aww, ain't that cute. He's got a bit of good left in<br/>him, after all.")
('Risette', "Is that so? You've set an admirable goal for yourself.")
('Quatre', "Huh. That's...quite mature of you, actually.")
('Judith', "Well, that's a great idea! You're doing your<br/>mom proud.")
('Bergard', "I see. You've set yourself a goal and committed to it...<br/>Impressive.")
('Eddy', "Wha...? It's not like that! Shut up!")
('Van', 'Yeah, yeah. Hey, can I get two bags, please?')
('Eddy', 'H-Hey! You even listening?!')
('Eddy', "D-Don't you DARE tell my old lady! Got it?!")
('Eddy', "Oh, and they're hot, too. Don't come cryin' to me if<br/>you burn yourself!")
('Eddy', "D-Don't get all high and mighty just because!")
('Eddy', "I get it, okay? You helped me out a couple times, and<br/>I do live in this neighborhood with you... My stand<br/>and the old lady's shop are here, too...")
('Eddy', "So we're neighbors, but we're NOT friends, got it?!")
('Van', "(Heh. So it IS a stand.) Yeah, I know. Don't worry.")
('Eddy', 'Tch...')
('Eddy', '(This is the part where you kiss up, you...you jackass!)')
('Van', '(Kids his age, man.)')
('Eddy', 'Tch. Figures this is the hot spot...')
('Eddy', "All the traffic just had to run right by the old<br/>lady's shop... Tch. Nothin' I can do about that.")
('Eddy', 'Y-Yeah? You again? What do you want?')
('Eddy', "Hmph. You're not the boss of me. I can do whatever<br/>I want, so get lost!")
('Eddy', 'Hmm... Wish I could find a darker spot. Too much<br/>light here...')
('Eddy', 'H-Huh? What? You got a problem?!')
('Eddy', "I ain't doing anything wrong, so piss off!")
('Eddy', 'Y-You again?! Get off my back, bitch!')
('Van', "What's your deal, dude? This is my<br/>neighborhood, too. You sayin' I ain't got a right to<br/>be here?")
('Eddy', "(Urrgh...! He's right and I freakin' hate it! He's killing<br/>my vibe here...)")
('Eddy', 'What is WITH you old hags? Wish adults would just<br/>shut up and leave me alone... *grumble*')
('Eddy', 'Not like I can go home anyway...unless I wanna deal<br/>with HER.')
('Eddy', "But I ain't got anything left on me... Urrgh! What am<br/>I supposed to do?!")
('Eddy', 'Y-You?! Can you just leave me alone, you pricks?!')
('Agnès', 'He really could stand to be more honest with himself.')
('Van', "Hey, word of advice: don't touch my car if you wanna<br/>keep your kneecaps.")
('Quatre', "Aidios alive, you're glaring at him like he just kicked<br/>a puppy.")
('Eddy', "You lookin' for Simon? He's probably over at the<br/>basketball court in Seiden.")
('Eddy', 'Tch... Not a single mira from the old lady.')
('Eddy', "I told her I'd come back for a bit, but...now I gotta<br/>beg for money, too, 'cause I'm freakin' BROKE.")
('Eddy', "Huh? The hell you want, old timer? Keep your nose<br/>outta other people's business!")
('Brenda', '*sigh* You finally come home and this is how you talk<br/>to me?')
('Eddy', 'No one asked you how you feel, old hag! Just gimme<br/>my allowance!')
('Eddy', "Huh? The hell you want, old timer? Keep your nose<br/>outta other people's business!")
('Van', 'Sir, yes, sir.')
('Van', "(Little shit could really use a good roasting, but that<br/>ain't my business.)")
('Brenda', "You can't eat if you don't work! If you're not gonna<br/>help out with the store, then don't bother coming<br/>back home!")
('Eddy', "...Tch, fine! I'll go and live my life all by myself!<br/>There!")
('Eddy', "I know you don't want me around anyway...")
('Brenda', "What was that?! This 'old hag' can't hear you!")
('Eddy', 'N-Nothing! Hmph!')
('Brenda', "W-Wait, Eddy! Don't! We need to stay here!")
('Eddy', "Well, we're not helping just twiddling our<br/>thumbs here! I've gotta go out and figure out how to<br/>stop this—")
('Van', "No, your old lady's right.")
('Brenda', "Van! Oh, thank heavens you're all okay!")
('Eddy', 'Wha...? Did you already clear out the monsters?!')
('Feri', 'We did a sweep, but there might be more monsters<br/>lurking around. You guys stay inside for now!')
('Van', "We're tryna figure out how to put a stop to this.")
('Van', "We're headin' back out. You guys mind keeping tabs<br/>on Old Town, making sure everybody's okay?")
('Brenda', 'You sure...?')
('Eddy', '(How is he so cool...?!)')
('Eddy', 'Er, I mean, okay. You guys handle the rest!')
('Brenda', "We've got food here, so if need be, we can make the<br/>rounds and keep the neighborhood stocked up.")
('Brenda', 'You folks best be careful, okay? Come back in<br/>one piece!')
('Risette', 'You have our word!')
('Van', 'Damn straight!')
('Anya', 'Welcome, welcome! 200 mira for a dip!')
("Anya's Mother", "It's always good to see you! One bath will be 200<br/>mira, please.")
('Van', 'Damn it. Fresh outta cash.')
('Anya', "I think everybody's settling down now! Phew...<br/>Everyone was panicking just a little bit ago.")
('Anya', "I don't really get this whole time freezing thing...<br/>The 'phenomenon,' or whatever you call it...")
('Anya', "...but what matters is that everyone's okay! I know<br/>you guys'll find a way to stop it!")
('Anya', 'Whew! We got way more customers than<br/>I expected!')
('Anya', 'The Tyrell Times wrote up an article about us, and<br/>that gave us a big bump.')
('Anya', "We've gotten a lot of business through word of<br/>mouth, too.")
('Anya', "Not gonna lie, I'm pleased as punch. Hope you guys<br/>are having fun, too!")
('Anya', "We're still just a bathhouse, y'know? There's not a<br/>whole lot we can do to celebrate the festival outside of<br/>just...doing the usual.")
('Anya', 'That Tyrell Times reporter gave us a glowing review!<br/>That should help in the short-term.')
('Anya', 'We just might need to prepare for a big rush of<br/>customers as a result. I should probably get on that.')
('Anya', "Gin, huh? All I really know about her is that she's<br/>stubborn as a mule.")
('Anya', "But she's pretty fun to listen to! She's lived a lot and<br/>seen a lot, so she's got plenty of stories to tell.")
('Anya', "And then my hat's off to Sister Myria, too—she<br/>planned the whole thing!")
('Anya', "Oh, hey, Van! Looks like you've got Judi...er, Judy<br/>with you too?")
('Judith', 'H-Hello, Anya! Thank you for yesterday.')
('Agnès', "Oh, don't tell me...")
('Van', "Did you seriously get ID'd by Anya? Let it slip in the<br/>bath or somethin'?")
('Judith', 'Urgh... I, er... I would not possibly.')
('Aaron', "You were any easier to read, you'd be a<br/>nursery rhyme.")
('Quatre', '(She really is an open book.)')
('Feri', 'Heehee, I can read your face!')
('Anya', "Hey, I'll never complain about more regulars<br/>coming in! I'll keep you posted on when our calmer<br/>hours tend to be.")
('Anya', "If it's just you, I can see about renting out a private<br/>space for you when you come in. Just let me know!")
('Judith', 'I really appreciate that. Thank you...')
('Judith', "There's just no better way to recharge. I need my bath<br/>fix to stay fit and fresh, or I get all cold and creaky.")
('Van', "(I agree, but man, it sounds like she's over the hill<br/>when she says it like that.)")
('Risette', '(Mr. Arkride, I suggest you keep such observations<br/>to yourself.)')
('Feri', '(Actually, I think Jadi—my grandpa—said the same<br/>thing last year...)')
('Quatre', "(Well, I suppose the bathhouse wouldn't mind her<br/>patronage...even if she does make a habit out of it.)")
('Anya', "We're a public bathhouse, so we're always around<br/>whenever you need to chill out.")
('Anya', "People are kinda on edge, and I don't blame them...")
('Anya', "Even ol' Huck hasn't popped in for a while now.")
('Anya', "But worrying isn't going to fix things. This place is<br/>for relaxing! Come on in however often you need to.")
('Anya', "Next month is looking... Oof. That's tight, there.<br/>The fuel price hikes are really gonna bite us...")
('Anya', 'I wonder how much a trip to Remiferia would<br/>run me?')
('Van', "You've been plannin' that for a while, haven't you?")
('Anya', "Yup! My grandpa and his family immigrated from<br/>there some time ago. I'd love to see the country<br/>for myself.")
('Anya', "My job as a clerk is well and good, but it doesn't give<br/>me much vacation time. I'd love to go on a trip<br/>or two...")
('Van', "Got'cha.<br/>(She's a character for sure.)")
('Van', "Well, just gotta keep at it. You'll get your time in the<br/>sun one day, I'm sure.")
('Anya', 'Thanks for the vote of confidence, heehee.')
('Anya', "But yeah, I've wanted to go for a while now. Maybe I<br/>should give it some thought.")
('Anya', 'Grandpa and his family immigrated from Remiferia<br/>quite some time ago.')
('Anya', 'He would always tell us about how beautiful of a<br/>place it was—how blue the water was, how clear the<br/>glaciers were... And he loved the people there.')
('Anya', '...I really would like to go there someday. Maybe one<br/>of these summers, I can plan a trip.')
('Quatre', '(I just wanted to say, umm... Thank you for<br/>accommodating me. I feel much more<br/>comfortable now.)')
('Anya', "(Happy to hear it! Just lemme know what else you<br/>need and I'll get it for you, no prob!)")
('Quatre', '(Thank you.)')
('Van', "(Heh. The baths'll win him over eventually, I'm sure<br/>of it.)")
('Anya', "Relax to the max, that's our motto! If you ever need to<br/>unwind, drop on by and have a soak.")
('Anya', 'Oh, so that uh, orbal drone thing of yours? I wonder<br/>if we could, like...advertise it. Get people to come<br/>see it.')
('Anya', "Tell you what: you lend it to us for the day, and I'll<br/>lend the bath to you for the whole day! Free<br/>of charge!")
('Van', "Conniving little girl, aren't you?<br/>(Hard to argue with a free day pass, though...)")
('Quatre', '(...She caught him hook, line, and sinker. I worry for<br/>him sometimes.)')
('Anya', "Old Huck has a ton of stories to tell... He's kinda like<br/>a grandpa.")
('Anya', "But then, he's the president of that big investment<br/>company, too. He's kinda weird like that...")
('Anya', "Yumé's gotten really good at running errands,<br/>hasn't she?")
('Anya', 'Oh, I know! I should teach her about tipping! I bet<br/>she could rack up a ton of tips with that smile of hers.')
('Van', 'Slippery slope, there. Better not go overboard.')
('Anya', '(Yeah, okay. This might be what I think it is.)')
('Anya', '(I mean, Sheena and Harry are friends, yeah, but<br/>beyond that, I dunno what to make of them...)')
('Anya', "(Maybe this'll be a good chance to find out. I'll have<br/>to keep a close eye on 'em.)")
('Van', "(Don't stick your nose where it doesn't belong, 'kay?<br/>Might get cut off.)")
('Anya', "Oh, don't worry! At the end of the day, it's their<br/>problem, not mine. Heehee!")
('Van', "(Guess it's natural for kids her age to poke fun at<br/>other kids. I'll leave 'em be.)")
('Anya', "So that's how it works... You have to make the words<br/>line up with the rhythm of the song. That's the real<br/>tricky part...")
('Anya', 'Father Nikolai wants me to include a word I learned<br/>recently, too. Man, he sure knows how to keep me<br/>on my toes...')
('Anya', "Let's see here... Ooh, 'corporatocracy'! That's a cool<br/>word I heard recently! But how do I include it in<br/>a sentence...?")
('Anya', "Oh, back again? Didn't you have a long soak this<br/>morning already?")
('Anya', 'Something must really be on your mind, huh?<br/>Heehee. I feel for you.')
('Anya', "I'll lend you an ear whenever. Just lemme know, 'kay?")
('Van', "I... Thanks? But like, who are you, the manager of the<br/>snack bar? My stuff's over your head.")
('Anya', 'Oof! Shot down!')
('Anya', "I mean it, though, okay? I know a lot about<br/>grownup problems... It's paperwork, isn't it? I bet<br/>it's paperwork.")
('Van', "Tch... Wish you weren't right about that.")
('Anya', 'Aww, your face is panicking! Heehee.')
('Anya', "Make sure to stay on top of all that paperwork, now!<br/>Paulette's gonna be mad if you miss rent.")
('Van', 'Hey, I know!<br/>(Kid knows too much, damn.)')
('Anya', "I just wrapped up the check book and all the old<br/>regulars are behaving themselves, so I've got time to<br/>work through the sales slips.")
('Anya', "They're changing the taxes around this year, so I<br/>gotta make sure I do them right.")
('Anya', "Man, this stuff's gotta be freaking you out, huh?<br/>Heehee.")
('Van', "...I go to the bath to DE-stress, y'know.")
('Anya', 'Back again, huh? You folks sure like your baths!')
('Van', 'What can I say? Feels good every time.')
('Feri', 'That löyly felt really good! Thanks for<br/>the recommendation.')
('Feri', 'Oh, are you doing homework there?')
('Anya', 'Huh? Oh, no. These are our accounting documents.<br/>I started doing the finances last year.')
('Agnès', 'B-Beg pardon? At your age?')
('Anya', "Eh, it's no biggie. Most of our costs are the same<br/>every year, so there's not much math to do.")
('Anya', "Apparently I've just always had a knack for numbers.<br/>I learned a lot of this stuff from watching other<br/>people, though.")
('Anya', 'I hear a lot of stuff about finance from old Huck and<br/>his gambling buddies, so maybe that helped?')
('Van', "Huh... Guess there's somethin' to be said for the<br/>school of hard knocks.")
('Feri', 'Hmm... I really do have a lot to learn.')
('Agnès', "(I knew she was mature for her age, but I hadn't<br/>expected that...)")
('Anya', "Hrm... What are Huck and his buddies up to?<br/>They're getting awfully loud over there.")
('Anya', "Gambling in here isn't against our rules, really—and<br/>they teach me some cool stuff about the math<br/>behind it...")
('Anya', "...but they'd better not be disturbing the<br/>other customers.")
('Anya', "I think I'll give them a little warning.")
('Agnès', "I don't see the clerk around. Are they open today?")
('Van', "Should be. They open at 5:30 in the morning...<br/>Kinda weird not to see the clerk up front.<br/>Maybe they're busy?")
('Van', 'Yo, Anya! Lemme get a soak!')
('Anya', 'Sorry, sorry! Welcome!')
('Anya', 'Just you today, huh? You never get tired of this place,<br/>do you?')
('Agnès', 'Wha...? The clerk is a child?')
('Anya', "Yup! My folks are busy, so I'm the clerk here.")
('Anya', "Have you heard about our special löyly bath? It's this<br/>steam sauna you walk right into! They're big in<br/>Remiferia, way up north.")
('Anya', 'My grandparents are both from there, so ours is the<br/>real deal!')
('Agnès', "Really? That sounds wonderful...!<br/>(I'd like to give it a try, now!)")
('Van', "Normally you're right up at the counter.<br/>Somethin' happen back there...?")
('Anya', "Oof, haha. I knew you'd notice. We had a pipe burst<br/>this morning...")
('Anya', "So we're closed for the day, sorry. We've got a guy<br/>repairing it, so hopefully we're back in business soon.")
('Van', 'Well, shit... Sucks, but what can you do. Hope you<br/>guys get that fixed soon.')
('Agnès', 'Right, of course.<br/>(Does Van...frequent this place?)')
('Anya', 'Do come again!')
('Anya', "I never thought you'd go and put a part-timer on<br/>your payroll.")
('Anya', "She's really pretty, too. You'd better be careful, Van—<br/>you never know what kinda mistakes you'll make in<br/>the heat of passion!")
('Van', "Aidios, did you pick up that sleazy shit from Huck?<br/>We're all business, so don't go spreadin' crap<br/>about us.")
('Anya', "All righty! It'll be neat to see how she does as<br/>a spriggan.")
('Agnès', "(I'm attracting attention already, for better or worse.<br/>I'll have to work hard!)")
('Yumé', "Here you go! Mommy's special lunch set!")
('Anya', 'Thanks, Yumé! I was just starting to get hungry.')
('Anya', "Here's the money, and here's your tip. Make sure you<br/>count it all properly, okay?")
('Yumé', "'Kay!")
('Agnès', "Looks like you're really on top of things, Yumé!")
('Yumé', "Heehee, of course! I'm the poster girl, after all!")
('Van', "Damn. Six years old and you're runnin' errands<br/>for mom? Smart cookie.")
('Risette', 'Heehee. Yumé has a bright future ahead of her.')
("Anya's Mother", 'You can leave this to me. The neighborhood folks<br/>trust me, so I should be able to keep them calm.')
("Anya's Mother", "It's not looking good out there...but you guys can<br/>do it! I know you can!")
("Anya's Mother", "Make sure you've got everything sorted out before<br/>you go!")
("Anya's Mother", "Anya was just over the moon this morning—<br/>apparently they're doing some special class at Sunday<br/>School today.")
("Anya's Mother", "As a parent, I'm happy to see the school so engaged<br/>with its students. I appreciate how they tweak and<br/>refine the lesson plans as they go!")
("Anya's Mother", "Anya may be wise beyond her years, but she still has<br/>much to learn. I want her to soak up everything she<br/>can while she's still young and curious.")
("Anya's Mother", "Oh! Welcome! Anya's at Sunday School today.")
("Anya's Mother", "She's run the front desk so smoothly, it's been a while<br/>since I manned it myself.")
("Anya's Mother", "Goodness, I hope I'm not rusty.")
('Anya', "Van, everyone! You're all okay!")
('Fie', "Sorry for worrying you. We've got it all under<br/>control now.")
('Feri', "We've destroyed the demon spheres, so the monsters<br/>should be weaker now!")
("Anya's Mother", 'Oh, thank goodness...')
(15037, 'Are we getting any help from outside?')
('Van', "Probably not. Everybody's got their hands tied...")
('Van', "...but we're gonna figure this shit out, I promise.<br/>You don't get to just take over our town like that!")
('Anya', 'Van...')
('Anya', "Okay! I'll hold down the fort here! I'll make sure the<br/>neighbors are okay, too!")
('Anya', 'The bath is still up and running, so if you need it,<br/>lemme know!')
('Huck', "Hah, you're a lucky girl, Anya. Work's keeping me<br/>tied down all through the festival.")
('Huck', "Banquets, parties, all that crap. It's all a nightmare<br/>this time of year.")
('Anya', 'You know, you complain about this EVERY year!')
('Anya', 'They were saying what, 200,000? If we get that many<br/>people at the festival—')
('Huck', "Oh, don't even get me started. It's gonna be<br/>a nightmare...")
('Huck', "The real giveaway is the GDP: more money in<br/>people's pockets means more tourists at the festival.<br/>And they were saying the GDP rose 25% this year.")
('Anya', 'Oh, really? Then that means...')
('Huck', 'Yeah, using this index, you can calc figures here<br/>like so...')
('Van', '(Huh. Not the most likely friendship, but good<br/>for them.)')
('Huck', "Oh, we were just talking about the rise of pork<br/>barrel politics. It's really shifting the market around as<br/>of late. Wanna shoot the shit?")
('Van', 'Sorry, all that just flew over my head. Gonna have<br/>to pass.')
('Huck', "Fair. Oh, hey, is that the—why, yes it is! I'd recognize<br/>that body anywhere. I've seen you once or twice in<br/>the neighborhood.")
('Huck', 'And is it just me, or do you... I just feel like I saw you<br/>somewhere else, too. But where...?')
('Judith', "I-I haven't the foggiest idea what you're<br/>talking about!")
('Feri', "(Don't tell me he's figured it out...?)")
('Huck', "That's it! There was this apprentice singer I met back<br/>when I was a young lad... Now it's coming back<br/>to me.")
('Huck', 'I got to listen to her sing just this wonderful chanson!<br/>Knocked me off my feet! You look just like her,<br/>I swear!')
('Judith', 'An apprentice, huh?')
('Agnès', 'You might be thinking of someone else.')
('Aaron', "What, that's it? No big backstory or anything?<br/>Laaame.")
('Van', "(I don't like where this is going, but I couldn't tell<br/>you why. I'll just butt out.)")
('Huck', "I was just a young man at the time, and heavens, she<br/>had me wrapped around her finger before I could<br/>say, 'bravo.'")
('Huck', "She made her debut around that time, and then her<br/>career just exploded overnight. She's a real big<br/>shot now.")
('Huck', "But to me, she'll always be that humble girl I saw on<br/>that little old stage...")
('Judith', '(Wait, that sounds like... Oh. Oh, dear.)')
('Judith', "(I don't want to open THAT can of worms, so I'll<br/>keep quiet.)")
('Huck', "*sigh* I just can't catch a break.")
('Huck', "My kingdom for another look at that vixen... I've only<br/>seen her in passing, but she steals my heart<br/>every time!")
('Van', "(Who, Judith?) My guy, just quit while you're ahead.")
('Huck', "Now, I'm no diplomat, but I have an idea of how<br/>this'll impact the marketplace...and I don't like where<br/>it's headed.")
('Huck', 'The markets are like horses—they spook real easily.<br/>You get a big incident like this and futures plummet.')
('Huck', 'I can only hope they get it all resolved soon...<br/>How they can even do that, though, is beyond me.')
('Huck', 'Insurance companies are all on fire right now.<br/>That can bleed over into other sectors pretty quickly<br/>if it keeps up...')
('Huck', "Here's hoping they get it all straightened out sooner<br/>rather than later.")
('Huck', 'Ahh, the sauna really hit the spot today.')
('Huck', "I saw some teenager in there, too. Couldn't have been<br/>older than fifteen or sixteen.")
('Huck', 'I could see the bags under his eyes—probably<br/>preparing for entrance exams. I worry for the lad.')
('Huck', "Nosy, I know, but I can't help worrying about him as<br/>a neighbor.")
('Huck', "Kids like stickin' it to the man at that age, just<br/>breaking rules for the sake of breaking them...")
('Huck', '...but really, he tried putting his slimy fingers<br/>on Judith?! JUDITH?!')
('Huck', 'That filthy little horndog! How dare he dash my<br/>hopes and dreams like that?! Just... BASTARD!')
('Quatre', "(Umm... What's he on about?)")
('Van', '(Beats me. Just leave him be, I guess.)')
('Agnès', 'Oh, dear... He seems quite upset.')
('Van', "Bud, you're no spring chicken anymore. Let her go.")
('Huck', "Ex-CUSE you! I may not look like a chicken, but I've<br/>still got one!")
('Huck', "(Anya's got a bright future ahead of her... I wanted to<br/>give her some experience handling this sort of<br/>thing, but...)")
('Huck', "(...Bah. Maybe it's too early. There'll be<br/>another time.)")
('Huck', "This really isn't my speed. Won't somebody take this<br/>poor old man's place...?")
('Agnès', "I, umm...<br/>(He's more cunning than he lets on.)")
('Van', "(Eh, not really. What'cha see is what'cha get<br/>with him. Just be yourself.)")
('Huck', "Van, m'boy! What brings you here today?")
('Huck', "I'll be having some senators over for a meal...<br/>Good networking, but man, these stuffy<br/>meetings just drive me up the wall.")
('Van', 'Coulda fooled me, you look chill as ever.')
('Van', "(First time I've seen Huck in a suit. Y'know, he looks<br/>presentable, for once.)")
('Van', '(I should probably bring him up to speed, while I got<br/>the chance.)')
('Van', 'Yo, so about the request from before. I met up with<br/>Roderick, no issues there.')
('Van', 'Pulled it off without a hitch. Thanks for the help,<br/>old timer.')
('Huck', "Oho! Well, that's good news.")
('Huck', "I hope he's doing well, the boy?")
('Van', 'Yeah. The yuppie life suits him pretty well.')
('Huck', 'Is he, now?! I might have another fellow to bellya—<br/>er, discuss business with! What a joyous day!')
('Huck', 'Remind me to get in touch with him.')
('Huck', "Sullivan's been tracking that incident like<br/>a bloodhound. No doubt she's caught a whiff of<br/>something by now.")
('Huck', "I imagine she's heard a thing or two about<br/>Roderick, too.")
('Huck', "Best of luck, Van—this old man's counting on you.")
('Huck', "Ahh, the table's calling my name! I'm gonna go at it<br/>until my wallet cries for mercy!")
('Huck', '...Is what I would like to say, but I have business to<br/>tend to at night.')
('Huck', 'I have to at least do my job in passing, or the suits<br/>around me get all crotchety.')
('Van', 'Think of it like brain training. Gotta stay sharp at<br/>your age, yeah?')
('Huck', "Zip it, whippersnapper! Besides, what's the harm in<br/>going senile? My brain goes to mush, I go to a nursing<br/>home with beautiful ladies who tend to my every need!")
('Agnès', "(I could swear I've seen him somewhere before...)")
('Agnès', '(Perhaps it was just my imagination.)')
('Feri', "I don't really get it, but I guess he's doing all right<br/>for himself.")
('Aaron', 'There really is nothing sadder than a boring dream<br/>like that.')
('Aaron', "Where's the fire? The passion? Screw a nursing<br/>home, I'd want a whole harem before I go out!")
('Huck', "Oooh, now that's the spirit, young man! What a<br/>wonderful idea!")
('Van', 'Yeah, okay, enough of that. You two fantasize off<br/>the clock.')
('Huck', 'Anyhow, I have to head out tonight...')
('Huck', "What a chore. Can't an old man like me just gamble<br/>in peace?")
(15037, "Ah, blast it! That's it for me...")
(15038, "When'd Anya get so good at mahjong?<br/>She racked up a sanbaiman like nobody's business...")
('Huck', "To think we taught her how to play... We've raised<br/>a monster!")
('Huck', '...Our poor, poor wallets.')
('Van', '(Wow. Total shellacking across the entire table.)')
(15038, 'I miss the days when Anya was still green. We just<br/>had her around to fill the table, back then.')
(15037, "We used to give her candy for coming up to play...<br/>Now we can't stop her.")
('Huck', "She just soaks up math and numbers like a sponge.<br/>We don't stand a chance against her...")
('Huck', "Wahaha! How about another pon for you? This game's<br/>as good as mine now!")
('Feri', 'Oh, this is, uhh...mahjong, right? I remember they<br/>were playing it this morning.')
('Van', "Yup. Old Eastern table game. Those old farts'll play it<br/>till they drop if you let 'em.")
('Van', '...But damn. A 30,000 point gap? Whew.')
(15037, 'Leave it to Huck, the showoff!')
(15038, "Van, old boy, lend us a hand, won't you?")
('Huck', "Keep your hands off him! He's MINE! The day he<br/>turns to you scoundrels is the day I kick the bucket!")
('Van', "Well, you're chipper today, ain'tcha, Huck?")
('Agnès', 'That he is...')
('Huck', 'They call the three of us the Old Dragons of Old<br/>Town, you see.')
('Huck', 'Let me show you how we earned that moniker, eh?<br/>Come, to the table!')
('Agnès', "Well, wait, don't you need four to make a full group?")
('Van', "Yup. That's their thing—they're big on bluffin', but<br/>you can see right through 'em.")
('Huck', 'Grr! Yes, yes, we know!')
('Huck', "That's why we need a young gun or two—like<br/>you, Van! C'mon!")
('Feri', "(They're really active for their age... Old Town's a<br/>great place to live!)")
('Huck', 'Just a crying shame, I tell you. I hope they can get the<br/>baths back open soon.')
('Huck', 'But I say, good company and good games wash my<br/>troubles away just as well!')
('Huck', "Now, then, I figure it's about time for dinner.<br/>I'll drag my old bones over to Montmart—they got food<br/>for my belly, and Paulette's food for my soul!")
('Huck', "Well, say it ain't so...")
('Huck', 'I guess the young blood was always bound to catch up<br/>to us. *sigh* How the mighty have fallen.')
('Huck', "Oh, Van! Got someone with you today? Now, she's<br/>quite the fetching young lady, isn't she?")
('Huck', "...Don't be breaking any laws, now.")
('Van', "Do I look like some kinda sleazebag to you? She's my<br/>new employee, she's workin' part time at<br/>Arkride Solutions.")
('Agnès', 'My name is Agnès. Pleased to meet you!')
('Huck', "Now, I've heard a lot about you already, young lady!<br/>My name's Huck—this here boy and I go way back.")
('Huck', "A shame they don't have any mixed baths here...<br/>Heh heh.")
('Van', '...And you were telling ME not to break the law.')
('Huck', "Wahaha! Oh, pay me no mind! I just can't help<br/>taking in sights for these sore eyes of mine.")
('Agnès', "(He's, umm... He's quite the lecher, isn't he?<br/>He certainly stands out.)")
('Huck', "You'll find me here just about all day.")
('Huck', 'Have you tried the löyly yet? It works wonders, I say!')
('Huck', 'My mind and body are ready to hustle!')
('Van', "That's well and good, but you're gonna blow through<br/>your savings if you just goof off every day.")
('Huck', "Now, Anya, you've got a good head on your shoulders<br/>and a knack for math like nobody I've ever seen...")
('Huck', "...so tell you what: how about you help with my article<br/>for next year's economic outlook? Exciting, huh?")
('Anya', "No way, Jose. That's your job! You shouldn't need a<br/>little kid to help you write your paper.")
('Anya', "Do it yourself, why don't you?")
('Huck', 'Denied! Oh, the humanity!')
('Van', 'Man, you never change, do you?')
('Reporter Chen', 'So, as I understand it, even after achieving such<br/>success as an investor, you continue to live a<br/>humble lifestyle in Old Town...')
('Huck', '(*sigh* Does he really need to scrutinize me? Let me<br/>live my life in peace, damn it!)')
('Agnès', "(Wait, isn't that...?)")
('Reporter Chen', "I'm joined today by Walter Huckberry, the financial<br/>wunderkind who turned his company into one of<br/>Zemuria's very best consulting firms.")
('Reporter Chen', "Thank you for your time today, Mr. Huckberry.<br/>I'd like to ask you about your approach to balancing<br/>your investments with your personal dealings...")
('Huck', 'Oh, my aching back... This is all such a pain. Let me<br/>just head on home already...')
('Van', "You're slippin', old man. Hang in there.")
('Feri', "Wow... I didn't know about all that. I thought he was<br/>just your average retiree!")
('Aaron', 'Talk about a crouching tiger. I thought he was just<br/>some doddering old fart gambling his golden<br/>years away.')
('Risette', "In other circles, he's Walter Huckberry, financial guru<br/>and revered consultant to hedge funds the world over.")
('Agnès', '(I knew I recognized him from somewhere...)')
('Huck', "Oh, stop it. I'm no fan of the spotlight, got it?")
('Huck', "You kids leave me be! I can't relax when you're all<br/>staring at me like that.")
('Reporter Chen', "I-I'm sorry! I didn't mean to intrude...")
('Van', "Dude, the reporter's just doin' his job. Act like an<br/>adult, will ya?")
('Vicar Nikolai', "It may surprise you to learn that I'm a Thaumaturge<br/>myself—I learned well from the church.")
('Vicar Nikolai', "So you needn't worry for me—I can hold my own<br/>against these foul creatures.")
('Vicar Nikolai', "I've received word of numerous casualties here in<br/>Old Town. I'll make sure to treat everyone I can as I<br/>do my rounds.")
('Vicar Nikolai', 'Let us both tread carefully and keep our wits<br/>about us. Goddess be with you.')
('Vicar Nikolai', 'The festival coincides with a special mass we hold<br/>here at the church.')
('Vicar Nikolai', 'The Revolution Festival is more than just a holiday: it<br/>is a day when we express our gratitude for family,<br/>fraternity, and neighborly love.')
('Vicar Nikolai', 'I, too, need my rest—I visited the sauna this morning<br/>to cleanse my body and soul preceding the festival.')
('Vicar Nikolai', "If you'd like, please take a moment to pray.")
('Van', "That's our Nikolai, pious as ever. We'll stop by if we<br/>get the time.")
('Vicar Nikolai', 'Oh...?')
('Vicar Nikolai', "You've something on your mind, I see. It doesn't<br/>seem to be troubling you, but it does...concern you, in<br/>a sense.")
('Van', "Heh. Can't hide anything from you, can I? I just ran<br/>into an old face for the first time in a while, is all.")
('Van', "(That obvious I'm worked up, huh? Man...)")
('Vicar Nikolai', "I'm running a bit late today. I had some business to<br/>attend to this morning.")
('Vicar Nikolai', "But now that I'm here, I can lead you in prayer for as<br/>long as you wish.")
('Van', 'Thanks much.')
('Vicar Nikolai', 'The Goddess walks with us always. When you find<br/>yourself lost, you need only offer your prayer<br/>unto Her.')
('Vicar Nikolai', 'May the Goddess smile upon you.')
('Vicar Nikolai', "Over these last two weeks, I've made a point of being<br/>an ear for the townsfolk's troubles.")
('Vicar Nikolai', 'I believe that is the first step toward overcoming their<br/>woes—having someone who will listen can help them<br/>open up and understand themselves better.')
('Vicar Nikolai', 'A broken heart does not easily mend. Many still carry<br/>those wounds inside them—unseen and untreated.')
('Vicar Nikolai', 'I wish to give them a shoulder to lean on...an ear<br/>for their troubles. I wish to heal them, not just<br/>as a clergyman, but as a neighbor and a friend.')
('Vicar Nikolai', "Today's Sunday School session was a rousing success,<br/>due in no small part to Sister Myria.")
('Vicar Nikolai', "She's grown much in her time with the church...<br/>I think she might be ready to take on<br/>more responsibility.")
('Vicar Nikolai', 'Three days have passed... Creil Village is still<br/>shrouded in mystery. I understand many<br/>feel directionless...')
('Vicar Nikolai', 'Our duty, however, has not changed. I shall conduct<br/>another mass today, and comfort those lost in fear<br/>and anxiety.')
('Vicar Nikolai', 'May we one day welcome peace again, under the<br/>auspices of the Goddess.')
('Vicar Nikolai', 'In my youth, I studied under Bishop Orwell at the<br/>Edith Grand Cathedral.')
('Vicar Nikolai', 'He has truly earned his title, junior only to<br/>the archbishop. I deeply admire his candor<br/>and diligence.')
('Vicar Nikolai', 'Haha... Ah, the nostalgia. Much time has passed<br/>since those wonderful days...')
('Vicar Nikolai', '...but those experiences have shaped me into the man<br/>I am today. I have Bishop Orwell to thank for that.')
('Vicar Nikolai', 'I was quite the troublemaker in my youth, if you<br/>could believe it. Bishop Orwell was right to set<br/>me straight.')
('Vicar Nikolai', "I often find myself nostalgic for those days. I'm a<br/>much different man now...")
('Vicar Nikolai', "Bishop Watson and I go back to our training days at<br/>the Grand Cathedral. He's still busy as ever, from<br/>what I've heard.")
('Vicar Nikolai', "Word has it, he's serving as Bishop Orwell's assistant<br/>on quite the momentous assignment.")
('Vicar Nikolai', "I've much to talk about these days. Come, let me<br/>prepare some tea and castella for you.")
('Vicar Nikolai', 'Sister Myria is a wonderful teacher, truly. Her care<br/>for her students is immediately evident.')
('Vicar Nikolai', 'I am certain that her class will teach them much.<br/>I look forward to watching her.')
('Vicar Nikolai', "Ah. Good morning, everyone. Truth be told, I've<br/>found myself quite drawn to gardening these days.")
('Vicar Nikolai', "I'm often greeted by passersby as I water the<br/>plants here. I deeply appreciate that sense<br/>of community.")
('Vicar Nikolai', 'Now, then... Raymond taught me a better method for<br/>potting plants. I should give it a try.')
('Van', 'Huh. Well, whatever makes you happy.')
('Vicar Nikolai', 'Indeed. I lead a busy life, but it leaves me well and<br/>truly fulfilled.')
('Vicar Nikolai', "I hope you have a wonderful day yourself. If you ever<br/>need an ear for your thoughts, I'm happy to listen.")
('Vicar Nikolai', 'It warms my heart to see the schoolchildren enjoying<br/>their lessons.')
('Vicar Nikolai', "Beyond just sating their curiosity for the arts and<br/>sciences, I like that they're learning to appreciate the<br/>smaller joys in life as well.")
('Vicar Nikolai', 'I have Sister Myria to thank for teaching them<br/>so wonderfully. It pleases me to see them growing not<br/>just in mind, but in spirit as well.')
('Vicar Nikolai', 'I did hear that one Sunday School student has<br/>stopped attending classes as of late...')
('Vicar Nikolai', "I believe they're studying for entrance exams, hence<br/>their seclusion... I admit, that has me a<br/>touch concerned.")
('Vicar Nikolai', "Now, today's is a special lesson, class. We'll be writing<br/>our own songs today.")
('Vicar Nikolai', "I'd like you to think first about what kind of tone and<br/>rhythm you'd like to convey with your songs.")
('Vicar Nikolai', "And when you write your lyrics, I'd like you to use at<br/>least one word you've recently learned, be it from a<br/>book, a lecture, anything of the sort.")
('Vicar Nikolai', "Without further ado, let's begin our writing! If you<br/>get stuck or need help, I'm happy to guide you.")
('Vicar Nikolai', 'Sister Myria is blessed with a truly kind heart.')
('Vicar Nikolai', "She does sometimes get ahead of herself or<br/>misinterpret a question...but I don't think that's<br/>necessarily a bad thing. To err is human.")
('Vicar Nikolai', 'I feel a pressure to perform in kind, myself. I should<br/>find ways to improve, haha.')
('Vicar Nikolai', "Welcome to our... Ah! It's good to see you, Ferida.")
('Vicar Nikolai', 'I recall introducing the Central Eastern temple to<br/>you the other day. Has it helped you adjust to life in<br/>the capital?')
('Feri', "Uhh... Yeah, kinda! There's still a lot I don't really<br/>know, but I'll learn eventually! I think.")
('Vicar Nikolai', 'Haha... I admire your boundless energy.')
('Vicar Nikolai', 'Out of curiosity, have you heard of the three tenets<br/>of Calvard?')
('Feri', "The...three tenets? I don't think so.")
('Vicar Nikolai', 'In our country, we hold these values above all:<br/>freedom, equality, and fraternity. These form what we<br/>call the Calvardian constitution.')
('Vicar Nikolai', 'In short, we hold the belief that everyone, regardless<br/>of color, creed, or social standing, is born equal and<br/>deserves to be treated with dignity.')
('Vicar Nikolai', 'You may feel pressure to fit in, to carry yourself as a<br/>native would...but truly, there is no right or wrong<br/>way to be Calvardian.')
('Vicar Nikolai', 'You are the sum of your heritage and<br/>your experiences. So I say, treasure what makes<br/>you, you.')
('Feri', "Uh-huh... Yeah, I get that. It's just a little tough to<br/>wrap my head around.")
('Feri', "But thank you for teaching me! I'll keep the three<br/>tenets in mind!")
('Agnès', "(She's just so pure... Heehee. Don't worry, Feri.<br/>We'll help you along every step of the way.)")
('Van', '(All right, all right. Guess I gotta be an adult for her<br/>every now and then, heh.)')
('Vicar Nikolai', 'Our Calvard is woven from threads of many<br/>different colors. No one trait can define us all.')
('Vicar Nikolai', 'Our nation is not without problems, certainly...but<br/>the Calvardian constitution offers wonderful words to<br/>live by.')
('Vicar Nikolai', 'We must treasure ourselves, our neighbors, and the<br/>freedom we all share. Our celebration of our<br/>community is what fulfills our hearts.')
('Vicar Nikolai', 'Ah, good of you to come, Van. About the bathing<br/>advice you gave me...')
('Vicar Nikolai', 'I tried your steam bath method the other day, and I<br/>must say, it was lovely.')
('Vicar Nikolai', 'I felt fully refreshed after my soak—dare I say, I felt<br/>younger, even!')
('Van', "That's what I like to hear! Glad you enjoyed it.")
('Van', "I'm gonna have to tell you about how to use a<br/>vihta next. Takes a little effort, but I promise you'll<br/>love it.")
('Vicar Nikolai', "Oh, I would love that. You've won me over already—<br/>what sage technique of yours might I learn next?")
('Agnès', "...Huh.<br/>(He's quite the easygoing fellow, actually.)")
('Van', "(He is, once you get used to him. Just loves trying<br/>new things. He's down to earth beneath all that<br/>cloth—bit of a weirdo, even...)")
('Van', "(...but he's got a good head on his shoulders.)")
('Vicar Nikolai', "Welcome to our little chapel. It's good to see things<br/>so lively here, haha.")
('Vicar Nikolai', "I'm often asked how to find fulfillment and happiness<br/>in life... My best advice, from my own experience, is<br/>to live each day to the fullest.")
('Vicar Nikolai', 'In these lives we lead, we will invariably shoulder<br/>many personal burdens. Fear, sadness, anxiety...and<br/>indeed, sin.')
('Vicar Nikolai', 'Yet we are not meant to carry these burdens alone. In<br/>your time of need, you can always turn to the church,<br/>and to Aidios. I will always be here to pray with you.')
('Priest Watson', "Haha. I'm no match for you, I'm afraid.")
('Priest Watson', 'Our clergymen are wonderful, wise beyond<br/>their years. The Grand Cathedral is in good hands.')
('Priest Watson', "You should really drop by, sometime. I'm sure Bishop<br/>Orwell would be delighted to see you.")
('Vicar Nikolai', "Oh, Bishop Watson! So nice to see you. It's been<br/>quite some time, hasn't it?")
('Priest Watson', "I happened to be in the neighborhood on business, so<br/>I thought I'd stop by. You look like you've kept well,<br/>old friend!")
('Vicar Nikolai', 'I have, yes. I can only hope Bishop Orwell is staying<br/>healthy himself.')
('Vicar Nikolai', "But this isn't the best place to converse, I believe.<br/>Let's retreat to my office.")
('Vicar Nikolai', "I've developed somewhat of a sweet tooth in my<br/>old age. Would you like a piece of this castella I<br/>just baked?")
('Priest Watson', "You never cease to surprise, haha. Sure, I'll indulge!")
('Sister Myria', "E-Everyone, please stay indoors! It's far too<br/>dangerous outside!")
('Sister Myria', 'Ah...! Van, and everyone else! Are you working to<br/>expel those monsters?')
('Sister Myria', "I knew you wouldn't just sit idly by! You can always<br/>count on the spriggan to swoop in.")
('Van', "Damn straight! Good that you guys are already<br/>hunkerin' up.")
('Van', "You guys should be safe here, I don't think those<br/>monsters'll get in. But don't let your guard down.<br/>Myria, can I trust you to hold down the fort?")
('Sister Myria', 'Of course! Goddess be with you out there!')
('Sister Myria', "I'm not quite sure what's going on, but...what I AM<br/>sure of is that Father Nikolai entrusted the chapel<br/>to me!")
('Sister Myria', 'I will protect us from those unholy creations—I<br/>swear it!')
('Sister Myria', 'I leave the rest in your hands. Goddess bless you!')
('Sister Myria', "Now, welcome to today's special mass! I see we<br/>have more people than usual today.")
('Sister Myria', "I must say, I'm honored! It warms my heart to see so<br/>many of our neighbors here!")
('Sister Myria', "I do have a luncheon scheduled after mass—<br/>you're all welcome to eat and make merry together.")
('Sister Myria', "Montmart has offered to cater for our lunch! I've<br/>prepared some homemade dishes myself.")
('Sister Myria', "Oh, I'm just excited beyond words. May you have a<br/>wonderful day, too!")
('Sister Myria', 'Oh, right, right! Montmart said they were quite busy<br/>today, so I have to try to pick up our food early.')
('Sister Myria', 'Goodness, things are setting up to be quite busy after<br/>mass. Heehee! I do hope you enjoy the day!')
('Sister Myria', "Goodness me...! Tomorrow, I'm visiting the great<br/>cathedral for a meeting in Bishop Nikolai's stead!")
('Sister Myria', "He did tell me it was time I 'broadened<br/>my horizons'...")
('Sister Myria', "Well, I certainly can't let him down, can I? I'll give it<br/>my all!")
('Sister Myria', "I can't deny I'm nervous, but it's a wonderful<br/>opportunity to experience higher church duties!")
('Sister Myria', "So I need to rest up and ready myself. I'm sure this<br/>year's festival will be just wonderful!")
('Sister Myria', "I asked Gin for her help with today's special lesson,<br/>and I'm glad I did!")
('Sister Myria', 'She just has so many fascinating stories to tell.<br/>I learned a thing or two myself!')
('Sister Myria', 'And my goodness, the kids had so many curious<br/>questions for her at the end, heehee. I knew I was<br/>right to ask her!')
('Sister Myria', "We have many a churchgoer in for prayer today...<br/>I understand everyone's feeling uneasy.")
('Sister Myria', "I'll need to work as hard as I can to calm their spirits.<br/>They're depending on me!")
('Sister Myria', "Goodness, time flies when you're speaking with Gin.<br/>Before I knew it, night had already fallen.")
('Sister Myria', "There's still much we need to go over, so I'll be back<br/>at it in the morning!")
('Sister Myria', "I heard that a fellow priest visited Father Nikolai<br/>today...but I'm not sure who.")
('Sister Myria', "Apparently he's a high-ranking father from the<br/>Grand Cathedral. What would bring someone of his<br/>stature here, I wonder...?")
('Sister Myria', "I never have been able to get a read on<br/>Father Nikolai. It's gotten me curious now: just what<br/>kind of person is he?")
('Sister Myria', "If you ever need guidance, or anything at all, then<br/>please, reach out to me! I'll help as best I can!")
('Sister Myria', 'Oh, thank heavens... I was worrying all for nothing!')
('Sister Myria', 'However, seeing how kind Father Nikolai was did<br/>strike me as a bit odd...')
('Sister Myria', 'It felt as if he had...other motives. Very mysterious,<br/>he is.')
('Sister Myria', "I think I'll give the books a good dusting today!")
('Sister Myria', "Ah! You're the maid I've been seeing in the<br/>neighborhood lately.")
('Sister Myria', "I didn't realize you were working for Van! I'm sorry, I<br/>should have introduced myself sooner.")
('Risette', 'Not a problem. My name is Risette Twinings—<br/>pleased to make your acquaintance.')
('Risette', "I've been temporarily assigned to Arkride Solutions as<br/>their on-site concierge. In truth, though, I'm<br/>beholden to the Marduk Company.")
('Sister Myria', "I...see!<br/>(I don't really see, though. It's a touch confusing...)")
('Sister Myria', 'So, a concierge as in...? Is that like a special service?')
('Sister Myria', "I've noticed those kinds of things have cropped up<br/>more often here—like, erm, delivery service, cleaning<br/>service, that sort of thing.")
('Van', '(Flew right over her head.)')
('Agnès', "(It did... Her job description isn't very clear,<br/>in fairness.)")
('Sister Myria', "I do a thorough cleaning every so often, myself.<br/>It won't do to let dust colonize the chapel!")
('Sister Myria', 'Oh, right, right! On the topic of deliveries...')
('Sister Myria', 'Paulette asked me if I wanted a lunch delivered today.')
('Sister Myria', "And she says Yumé will be making the delivery!<br/>Oh, that bundle of sunshine just can't get here<br/>fast enough! I need to tidy up before she gets here!")
('Sister Myria', "Ah, today's Sunday School session was<br/>simply wonderful! I don't think I've ever seen a class<br/>so curious and eager to learn.")
('Sister Myria', "They're just so excited when it comes to reading and<br/>writing—not to say the other classes didn't go<br/>well, too!")
('Sister Myria', "I'm so glad I pitched the idea to Father Nikolai.<br/>I hope we get to hold another session soon!")
('Sister Myria', 'I knew Father Nikolai would be open to the<br/>idea, heehee!')
('Sister Myria', "It gives the kids an extra dash of learning, sans the<br/>long hours of the typical school day. They've taken to<br/>it well, reading and writing especially.")
('Sister Myria', "And most importantly, they're all excited to learn!<br/>Father Nikolai really knows how to pique<br/>their curiosity.")
('Sister Myria', "I'd love to host these regularly, and I'm sure the kids<br/>would, too. I'm so glad I get to do this!")
('Sister Myria', "Oh, I'm just over the moon. I can't thank Father<br/>Nikolai enough!")
('Sister Myria', "Normally he's reading and playing with the children...<br/>I don't know much about his teaching<br/>talents, though.")
('Sister Myria', "Still, I can't wait to see what kind of class he'll put on!")
('Sister Myria', "Well, hello there, Ferida! It's been a little while,<br/>hasn't it?")
('Sister Myria', "I just wanted to say... If you ever need a shoulder to<br/>lean on, I'll always be here. I know it must be tough,<br/>living so far from home at your age...")
('Sister Myria', "And you're having to support yourself, too. It's just...<br/>You're such a brave girl! I want to help you however<br/>I can!")
('Feri', "E-Err...<br/>(I'm glad she wants to help, but it's really not as hard<br/>as she's making it out to be...)")
('Sister Myria', "Oh, now that I think about it, you're working for<br/>Arkride Solutions, right?")
('Sister Myria', "So that means... Ohh! Van's helping you out, isn't he?<br/>Oh, that's wonderful!")
('Van', "Oh, I'm just keepin' her pointed the right way,<br/>heh heh.")
('Agnès', '(It might help her to look before she leaps<br/>to conclusions...)')
('Van', "(Just let her be, it's easier that way.)")
('Feri', "(I'm not sure I get her, but she seems really nice!<br/>Old Town feels nice and cozy.)")
('Sister Myria', 'It puts me at ease knowing that Van is<br/>watching over you.')
('Sister Myria', "I heard you're attending Sunday School at<br/>the temple. I know it's tough, having to put yourself<br/>out there in a new city at such a young age...")
('Sister Myria', "...but you have myself and all your neighbors here to<br/>help you! If you ever need anything, don't hesitate to<br/>ask me.")
('Feri', 'Of course! Thank you so much, Sister Myria!')
('Van', "G'morning, Sister Myria.")
('Sister Myria', 'Ah, good morning.')
('Sister Myria', "So, pardon my nosiness, but I've heard you're taking<br/>some...choice jobs.")
('Sister Myria', 'That your clientele sometimes runs on the, erm...<br/>unsavory side.')
('Sister Myria', 'But, umm...honestly, I love that! Just as the Goddess<br/>forgives those who let Her into their hearts, you too<br/>extend forgiveness to your clients!')
('Sister Myria', 'Hearing about the work you do, and...and the people<br/>you support without scorn or judgment is just...<br/>*sniffle* It simply moves me!')
('Sister Myria', "I'll support you all the way, so that you can support<br/>those in need!")
('Van', 'Haha, yep! I never turn down a client!<br/>(Long as they got dough.)')
('Agnès', '(Huh? Did you say something, Van? I felt as if you...<br/>let something slip there.)')
('Sister Myria', "Forgive my assumptions, Van... I didn't realize you<br/>had such a pure, compassionate heart!")
('Sister Myria', "As a woman of the cloth, I'm moved almost to tears!<br/>The Goddess smiles upon you... Please, keep up your<br/>wonderful work!")
('Van', "That's what Arkride Solutions is for! You can leave<br/>your past at the door.")
('Agnès', '(This feels...incorrect.)')
('Sister Myria', 'Oh, Father, about my idea for a Sunday<br/>School session...')
('Vicar Nikolai', 'Ah, yes. I do recall you mentioning that.')
('Vicar Nikolai', "I admire your passion, Myria. I'd be happy to<br/>implement that class the week after next.")
('Sister Myria', 'R-Really? You would?! Oh, thank goodness!')
('Sister Myria', "Thank you so much, Father! I'm sure you'll do<br/>just swimmingly!")
('Vicar Nikolai', 'I...will? I might be missing something.')
('Sister Myria', 'O-Oh? I thought I had... Well, my idea was, I<br/>wanted you to be the guest teacher for that class!')
('Sister Myria', "I mean, the children adore you! Surely they'll<br/>appreciate a class from you, right?")
('Vicar Nikolai', "Ah, haha... Now I understand. That said, I'm...not<br/>sure how my popularity would translate to<br/>teaching ability.")
('Vicar Nikolai', "But then, what is life without new experiences?<br/>I'll consider this a challenge of sorts, haha. Sign<br/>me up.")
('Vicar Nikolai', 'I see... Another special class, you say—and with a<br/>guest teacher this time?')
('Sister Myria', 'Yes, exactly! I was trying to figure out how we can<br/>make history class more interesting.')
('Sister Myria', 'I thought that perhaps if they had a teacher they<br/>knew and got along with, they would be more curious<br/>to learn.')
('Vicar Nikolai', "Now, I think that's a wonderful idea, Myria! I can<br/>always trust you to keep their best interests in mind.")
('Vicar Nikolai', 'Such a lesson plan would likely require a fair bit of<br/>work...but I trust you can handle it. Best of<br/>luck, Sister.')
('Sister Myria', 'I-I will! Thank you so much, Father!')
('Sister Myria', 'Blessings be, everyone...')
('Vicar Nikolai', "You're heading out, at a time like this? Please, do<br/>be careful...")
('Agnès', "Of course! We'll make sure of that.")
('Van', "I mean, I don't think we're gonna get riots out in the<br/>streets or anything like that.")
('Van', "The opposite, really: everybody's drained.<br/>They dunno what to do. But I think if anybody can<br/>help 'em, it's you guys here at the church.")
('Vicar Nikolai', 'Absolutely. No matter the situation, the church will<br/>always extend its hand to those in need.')
('Sister Myria', "I'll be here as well! I can't deny I'm nervous, but...I<br/>have to stay strong!")
('Sister Myria', 'Please stay safe, everyone!')
('Gin', 'Huh? Speak up, missy! You want me to<br/>TEACH, was that it?!')
('Sister Myria', "Yes, please! I'm looking for a guest teacher for their<br/>history lessons, and I think you'd make a<br/>wonderful lecturer!")
('Sister Myria', 'All the other elders in the neighborhood directed me<br/>to you. They said you would be the best for the job!')
('Gin', "Those backstabbin' little...!")
('Gin', "Look, I ain't some show pony you can parade around<br/>to keep kids busy! Leave me alone, damn it!")
('Sister Myria', "Wha...? N-No, that's not what I meant! I mean,<br/>what's the harm, anyway?")
('Gin', "What's the harm? WHAT'S THE HARM?! Ask<br/>my privacy!")
('Quatre', '(They seem quite animated today.)')
('Van', "(*sigh* Just ignore 'em. We don't need to hit up Gin's<br/>shop right now anyway.)")
('Curtis', "Wh-What's going on?! And why NOW?!")
('Curtis', 'Where are Dad and the others?! I knew they went off<br/>to Auber, but...but...!')
('Van', "I get you're anxious, but you're only gonna make it<br/>worse by wandering off out there.")
('Feri', "Please, stay inside until it's safe!")
('Curtis', 'Urgh... Okay, okay.')
('Curtis', 'But if you see Dad and the others, tell them to get<br/>back here ASAP!')
('Van', "Got'cha.")
('Risette', "We've no time to waste.")
('Feri', "Let's get moving!")
('Curtis', "Mom... Dad... If you don't come home, I-I swear...!")
('Curtis', 'G-Get your butts home, right now! Please...!')
('Curtis', 'Why do you have to just...?!')
('Zora', "I'm so sorry, Curtis. I realize now how harsh we were<br/>being to you.")
('Roman', 'I... Man, I regret not being there for you more.')
('Roman', "We've put a lot of thought into this, trust me.<br/>We want to set things right.")
('Curtis', "I just... I don't get it...")
('Curtis', '(I know this is all my fault... *sigh*)')
('Curtis', "(I'm glad we avoided making this a police thing, but<br/>one wrong move and the entrance exam wouldn't<br/>have even mattered anymore...)")
('Curtis', "(That bracer cleared things up for us, but one wrong<br/>move and the entrance exam wouldn't have even<br/>mattered anymore...)")
('Curtis', "(We've always been like this. How can we<br/>just change?)")
('Van', "(Huh. Somethin' sketch happen?)")
('Van', "(Looks like it's all cleared up, whatever it was.<br/>Guess it ain't my business.)")
('Curtis', "What's gotten into you two...? You were all normal<br/>until this morning, and now you're all soft and stuff...")
('Curtis', "...Fine, I'll take the medicine, okay?")
('Curtis', 'And, umm...thanks. I guess I owe you.')
('Curtis', 'YES! I got all the questions in the reference<br/>book right! Hah, told you I could do this!')
('Curtis', "Mom's not on my butt anymore, either. Oh, that<br/>feels good!")
('Curtis', "All right! It'll be an all-nighter for me tonight!")
('Van', "(Brat's been buggin' me for a while now...)")
('Van', "(...but he ain't my business. I don't have the<br/>time anyway.)")
('Curtis', "C'mon, focus... Okay... Equation here... That cancels<br/>out, so the proof is like that...")
('Curtis', "...Yes! That's the answer! Phew...! All that's left is to<br/>prove it!")
('Curtis', "All right! That's ahead of my pace, too! Ugh,<br/>I'm light-headed... Worth it, though!")
('Agnès', "(I didn't know one could get light-headed just<br/>from studying. That's some incredible focus.)")
('Quatre', "(It does happen. Hyperfocusing can leave you faint, if<br/>you're not careful.)")
('Van', "(Kid's got spirit... Maybe a bit too much spirit.<br/>Not my place to micromanage him, though.)")
('Curtis', 'I can barely stand being at home anymore, so I<br/>slipped out...')
('Curtis', "*sigh* What's so important about this stupid exam?<br/>It doesn't prove anything...")
('Curtis', 'Hell, why am I trying so hard to get into<br/>Aramis, anyway?')
('Curtis', "I've lost focus... I just can't do anything anymore.")
('Curtis', "My grades keep getting worse, Mom's all hysterical...")
('Curtis', "*sigh* And my head's a mess. What am I supposed<br/>to do?")
('Curtis', "Freaking... URGH! What's the deal with this<br/>stupid exam?!")
('Curtis', "How did I drop a hundred spots on the practice test?!<br/>I just... I don't get it!")
('Curtis', "I'm gonna fail at this rate... I'm gonna FAIL! Why is<br/>this happening to me?!")
('Curtis', "Wh-What's your deal?! Leave me alone!")
('Curtis', "Mom'll be unbearable if she finds out... I gotta find a<br/>way around that. Maybe a little white lie...")
('Curtis', 'Geez... Why did this practice test feel so much harder<br/>than the other ones?')
('Curtis', "But, well, I guess I should've expected that<br/>from Aramis. I can't let it get to me!")
('Curtis', 'The test results should be posted soon, and then I can<br/>use that to fine tune my strat for the real exam.')
('Curtis', "My first choice is the Aramis Academy. I mean,<br/>where else? It's the best high school in the capital.")
('Curtis', "Not that I'd expect common folk to know much<br/>about it. It's where the brightest stars like me go to<br/>hone their skills.")
('Curtis', '...Huh? Wh-What is it?')
('Agnès', "Oh, don't mind me.<br/>(So he's studying for Aramis' entrance exam?)")
('Feri', "(Could this be that 'big fish in a small pond' thing I<br/>heard once?)")
('Curtis', "What are you—what's with that smug look on<br/>your face? I... Err, never mind.")
('Curtis', "Just make sure you don't mix me up with the<br/>common dregs. I'm not an ordinary kid!")
('Curtis', "Dad's finally stopped getting on my case, so now I<br/>can focus on studying.")
('Curtis', "Heh, it was really nice giving him a taste of his<br/>own medicine. 'You're annoying' was all it took!")
('Curtis', "I can't let anything distract me on the road to<br/>Aramis—not even my parents.")
('Curtis', "Huh? What is WITH you? Do you just go sneaking<br/>into people's houses for fun?")
('Curtis', "Well, whatever. Just don't interrupt my studies, okay?")
('Curtis', "I've already got two helicopters bugging me, I don't<br/>need a third.")
('Curtis', 'These walls and floors are paper thin. I can hear<br/>everything down there... How am I supposed to study<br/>when everybody and their mother is interrupting me?!')
('Curtis', "*sigh* Those two are so freakin' annoying! It's their<br/>fault if I fail the exam!")
('Roman', 'When... How long HAS it been since we last ate<br/>together, actually?')
('Roman', "(I suppose I only have myself to blame. I've been<br/>crunching for years now...)")
('Roman', '(All of that just to be rewarded with a demotion.<br/>Am... Am I the real problem?)')
('Roman', 'So, bud, how are, umm...how are your grades?')
('Roman', "Er, no, no, that's not what I should be talking about.")
('Roman', "I just don't really know where to start...")
('Roman', 'I get off work early and come here to recharge after a<br/>day in a new office...')
('Roman', '...and I immediately hear about my boy<br/>causing trouble?')
('Roman', "What in the world is Zora doing?! I swear, that boy's<br/>lording over her!")
('Roman', 'Ahh... Montmart hits the spot every single time.')
('Roman', 'All my exhaustion from work just gets washed away.')
('Roman', 'Ahh... Montmart hits the spot every single time.')
('Roman', 'All my exhaustion from work just gets washed away.')
('Roman', 'That annoying little...buzzard! Zora drives me up<br/>the wall... This is MY house.')
('Roman', 'I put up with her, so she can stand to put up with me!')
('Roman', 'Harumph! Neither Zora nor Curtis give a damn<br/>what their breadwinner thinks.')
('Roman', 'Nobody does, I swear! Drives me mad!')
('Roman', 'Incidentally, where HAS that boy run off to?')
('Roman', "I haven't seen him around lately... Well, whatever.<br/>As if I care.")
('Roman', 'I come home after my first day of work and Zora just<br/>brushes me off!')
('Roman', "Harumph! Fine, then! If she doesn't wanna talk to<br/>her husband, I don't wanna talk to my wife!")
('Roman', "Maybe I'll just take the damned living room for<br/>myself, see what she thinks of that!")
('Roman', 'Curtis barely shows his face around here these days...')
('Roman', "Hmph! Kid wants to blow me off, I'll give him the<br/>cold shoulder too!")
('Roman', 'Whyyyyy...?! I was such a good cheeef...')
('Roman', "I'll be out of house arrest, soon... Then I gotta<br/>go work.")
('Roman', '...Perish the thought. Just thinking about it<br/>terrifies me.')
('Roman', "They didn't fire me...but my career's over. I'm back<br/>down to some subsidiary branch now...")
('Roman', "Urgh... Why's my heart beating so fast?")
('Paulette', "Roman, I think you've had quite enough.")
('Paulette', 'You should go home and get some rest, okay? Let me<br/>get you some water.')
('Roman', "I'm fiiine! Lemme drink a libble mo-*hic* Bwuh...")
('Roman', "I AIN'T! I ain't no dru... *buuurp*")
('Roman', "I just cand... I cand deal with it! The gossip rags're<br/>just LYIN' about ebrythin...")
('Roman', "Whuh? Who're you? You gobba...<br/>Gotta PROBLEM, huh? Zaddit?")
('Van', "(Damn. Middle of the day and he's down for<br/>the count.)")
('Feri', "(Wasn't he here the other day, too? Will he be<br/>all right?)")
('Roman', "This suuucks, man... I'm just cooped up at home<br/>wasting away. *sigh* I gotta start doing something.<br/>All the time in the world, for better or worse.")
('Roman', "Aidios, what a dump. People like me don't<br/>belong here... How'd I just go from riches to rags<br/>like this?")
('Roman', 'And who does my wife think she is, treating me like a<br/>pest in my own house?! Who funded her lifestyle?<br/>Who supported her kid?!')
('Roman', "...Tch. Barely even matters now... It's just me<br/>out here. All my crunching, all my work, and I have<br/>nothing to show for it...")
('Roman', "BWAAAHAAAAAH! Damn it all! Why'd<br/>this have to happen to me?!")
('Roman', "*hic* I'm NOT standin' for it! Demotion, my ass!<br/>They can sssuck my... My— *burp*")
('Agnès', "(Oh, dear... I think he's had a bit much to drink.)")
('Van', "(Guess work went south or somethin'.)")
('Zora', "Well, umm... Dinner's ready...")
('Zora', '(I know we have to talk this over as a family, but how<br/>do we even begin to unpack it all...?)')
('Zora', "(Especially when I'm the one who pushed Curtis<br/>that far...)")
('Zora', 'A-Anyway, I have to get dinner ready.')
('Zora', "Let's discuss this over dinner, okay?")
('Zora', "Well, I'll go ahead and get dinner ready. Your report<br/>will get here when it gets here.")
('Zora', '*sigh* What kind of wretch would give Curtis those<br/>ghastly pills?')
('Zora', "Surely my poor, innocent boy wouldn't stoop<br/>that low! He must have been coerced!")
('Zora', '*sigh* When are the fixers coming?')
('Zora', "I'm just beside myself... I need to sort this out with<br/>Curtis as soon as I can.")
('Van', "(Fixers, eh? I look 'em over on the bulletin board<br/>or somethin'?)")
('Zora', 'How...? How did an entire village vanish like that?<br/>I never thought the horrors from two years ago would<br/>surface again...')
('Zora', "Just what is the army doing? Don't tell me they'll have<br/>the city locked down all the way through the rest of<br/>exam season...")
('Zora', 'My word! Just, anything but that!')
('Zora', "Curtis lashed out at me... He said I was a distraction.<br/>He doesn't want me to enter his room and break<br/>his concentration.")
('Zora', 'I feel hurt... My poor boy...')
('Zora', 'But, well, his grades have markedly improved as<br/>of late. Perhaps that truly is what he needed.')
('Zora', "That said, if his grades fall again, he can bet I'll be<br/>back in there.")
('Zora', 'Who does he think he is, just lazing about in the<br/>living room? What a cockroach.')
('Zora', "He can prance about and bang his chest all he pleases,<br/>but he won't get so much as a glass of water from me.")
('Zora', 'Hmph! Sometimes I wonder how I fell in love with<br/>that man to begin with.')
('Zora', "I'm happy to see Curtis is studying well.")
('Zora', "I'd expect no less from my son, heehee! I'm sure he'll<br/>pass Aramis' entrance exam with flying colors!")
('Zora', "And my husband's finally gotten his lazy bum to<br/>work, too! Oh, I'm just over the moon!")
('Zora', 'Mmgh... I wish that sad sack in the living room<br/>would get up and move.')
('Zora', 'Who does he take himself for? He only has himself to<br/>blame for his demotion—no sob story will change<br/>his fortunes!')
('Zora', "If he's so content to just drift in the doldrums of<br/>mediocrity, then why should I placate him?<br/>He should make himself useful and leave!")
('Zora', "It simply baffles me. I've been keeping an eye on<br/>Curtis and his studies, but his grades just continue<br/>to drop...")
('Zora', "Don't tell me he's skipping behind my back? I swear,<br/>that boy...!")
('Zora', "That's it! I'm redoubling my efforts—this time, I'll set<br/>him straight!")
('Zora', 'Curtis is taking his sweet time... Too much time for a<br/>mere study break.')
('Zora', "*sigh* I knew I shouldn't have let him off his leash.<br/>The boy just can't take care of himself.")
('Zora', 'Starting tomorrow, he needs my permission to leave<br/>the house. He can play after he works!')
('Zora', "That should do the trick, I'm certain of it!")
('Zora', "My husband has been coming home later and later...<br/>but I'm hard-pressed to care.")
('Zora', "I can't stand the sorry drivel from that mouth of his.<br/>He should either leave his vitriol at the door, or just<br/>not come back at all!")
('Zora', 'I was about to go shopping when this woman<br/>stopped me.')
('Zora', "I just couldn't get a read on her! Can I really trust<br/>her...?")
('Zora', 'This is just commendably frustrating... What do<br/>I do?!')
('Zora', 'My husband had built himself a wonderful career at<br/>the Bank of Edith...')
('Zora', '...but then, he got himself embroiled in some filthy<br/>scandal, and now his career is all but sunk. What<br/>a slob!')
('Zora', 'Now look at us: living in some ramshackle bungalow<br/>to escape the prying eyes of the press. How much<br/>more will he shame our family?')
('Zora', "Hmph. I need to make sure the boy doesn't follow<br/>his example.")
('Zora', 'I see my husband has taken to public<br/>drunkenness now...')
('Zora', "Hmph. I don't know him anymore. He should count<br/>himself lucky that I'm not filing divorce papers!")
('Zora', 'Y-Yes?! What is it?')
('Zora', "Are you from the neighborhood? Sorry, but I'd rather<br/>you not consider me your neighbor. I'm not like you<br/>Old Town dregs.")
('Zora', 'Now, begone! Leave me be!')
('Agnès', '(Should we, erm, leave her be?)')
('Van', '(Yeah. I think her family just moved here... At any<br/>rate, not our job to unpack their baggage.)')
('Zora', 'Why, oh, why must I suffer so...?')
('Zora', 'I have to at least make sure Curtis passes his exams...<br/>*mumble* *mumble*')
('Roman', 'You see, Curtis, your papa got to where he was by<br/>working long and hard, just like your studying.')
('Roman', "But I can't say for certain that doing so brought<br/>me happiness. It distracted me from my family,<br/>from...you.")
('Roman', "So... I don't want you to follow in my footsteps.")
('Curtis', 'Huh?!')
('Curtis', "I... Wha...? Th-There's only a month and a half until<br/>the entrance exam! What am I supposed to do?!")
('Curtis', "I can't just stop now! That's not fair!<br/>C-C'mon, Mom, you agree, don't you?!")
('Zora', "Well, honey, I'm...not so sure, myself.")
('Zora', "I owe you an apology... After talking with some<br/>friends, I've realized that I was much too pushy about<br/>your studies.")
('Zora', "I think it might be best if you decide what you want<br/>for yourself. I know it's a lot to ask, but...it's clear I<br/>haven't been helping you.")
('Curtis', 'Wha—you, too?! I... What the hell?!')
('Roman', 'Ah, Zora. Would you like to, erm...hit the festival<br/>with me?')
('Zora', "Hmm... Yes, let's. It's been quite some time, hasn't it?")
('Zora', 'To think we used to tour the city in an ETWS limo<br/>and party our worries away...')
('Roman', 'Quite the socialites, we were...')
('Roman', "But perhaps this is what we need. It'll give us some<br/>time to think things over—maybe we can figure out<br/>where to go from here.")
('Zora', 'Curtis? How are your studies going?')
('Zora', "...Only three questions, huh? That won't do, come<br/>exam time. You need to figure out how to improve<br/>your pace—")
('Curtis', 'I-I know, I know! Be quiet!')
('Curtis', "And could you stop peeking in every hour? It's really<br/>anno—I mean...it throws me off!")
('Zora', "I'm just trying to make sure you don't get distracted.")
('Zora', "I'll bring you a snack if it helps, so keep at<br/>it, understood?!")
('Curtis', "(Geez... Mom's really been a pain in the ass lately.)")
('Zora', 'Do you understand me? I expect full marks on your<br/>practice test!')
('Zora', 'This will make or break your future, young man!<br/>If nothing else, think of your mother...')
('Curtis', "(Would she shut up?! She's even worse than she<br/>usually is... It's driving me up the wall!)")
('Natalia', 'Ahh, yes. Your family moved here just the other day,<br/>if memory serves correct. Quite the change of scenery<br/>from your bougie old neighborhood.')
('Natalia', 'Now, what could have happened to cause such a<br/>drastic change? Folks of your status are a rare sight in<br/>Old Town.')
('Zora', 'E-Err, well, umm...')
('Zora', '(This old crow has me in her talons. I need to find a<br/>way out of here, posthaste...!)')
('Natalia', 'It might surprise you to learn that I used to be a<br/>police officer.')
('Natalia', "In my heyday, I was the Bloodhound of the SID.<br/>If you've got something that needs taken care of, I<br/>just might be able to help!")
('Zora', 'Wha—?! Are you serious?!')
('Zora', "(Bloodhound?! So she's more than meets the eye...<br/>She might be able to help with my husband, but...)")
('Agnès', "A bit of a departure from her previous title, isn't it?")
('Agnès', 'The Bloodhound of the SID? I had no idea she used<br/>to be in the police force.')
('Van', "Yeah, because she wasn't.")
('Feri', "Bloodhound? Wow, I didn't know she was an officer<br/>back then!")
('Van', "Yeah, because she wasn't.")
('Aaron', 'Bloodhound? Looks like your common bitch to me.')
('Van', "Yeah, she's all bark and no bite. Just ignore her.")
('Van', "Lady, don't go yankin' people's chains like that.")
('Natalia', 'Oh, dear, heehee. Did I get too carried away, there?')
('Jess', "What if I just told them both the truth...? I don't even<br/>know how many times I've considered it.")
('Jess', 'I just never expected things to turn out the way<br/>they did.')
('Jess', 'I guess miracles do happen... Heh. Some new lyrics<br/>just popped in my head.')
('Jess', "Today's the day... My record's on the shelves now.")
('Jess', "My big debut's done and over with, but... *sigh* I'm<br/>still just as restless as I was before.")
('Jess', "Maybe I should hit up the record stores and see what<br/>people think. I do kinda wanna see Raymond's jacket<br/>cover in action.")
('Jess', 'The plan is to put on a little show tonight to celebrate<br/>my debut.')
('Jess', "It'll be at the usual spot, the Blue Score. The owner<br/>there's really helped me out.")
('Jess', "I'll need to give this performance my all—it's the least<br/>I can do to repay his kindness.")
('Jess', "So those, uh, 'idols' I met recently. They asked me to<br/>direct some of their music.")
('Jess', "Being honest, that genre's pretty far out of<br/>my wheelhouse...")
('Jess', "...but I gave it my best shot. I think it turned out<br/>all right. Hopefully it's still as cheery as they wanted it<br/>to be.")
('Jess', "Once they nail the basics, the message should<br/>shine through. I'm just giving them a helping hand, as<br/>it were.")
('Jess', "Apparently this is the debut song they wrote.<br/>I'll tidy it up as best I can.")
('Jess', "...It's been a while since I got some good news. I hope<br/>this debut will help lift my spirits.")
('Jess', "Ah. You're the spriggan, right?")
('Jess', "Sometimes I struggle to carry on... I don't know if<br/>this is the right thing to do.")
('Jess', 'No matter how well my music sells, how much my<br/>audience entreats me...')
('Jess', "If only I could just... No, I can't. This is the way it has<br/>to be.")
('Quatre', '(He has much on his mind, from the sounds of it.)')
('Agnès', "(Indeed...but it doesn't sound like he wants to talk to<br/>us about it.)")
('Van', "(We all got our problems. Best not to stick our noses<br/>where they don't belong.)")
('Jess', 'Is this...really all right?')
('System', "C'mon, don't sell yourself short. Your music is<br/>incredible and people are finally starting to notice.<br/>The agency knows you're gonna be a big hit.")
('System', "That's why they greenlit the new record to<br/>begin with.")
('System', 'This is your big break here. You gotta decide what<br/>your brand is, so yeah, I think the jacket design is<br/>really important.')
('Jess', "You're right, you're right. I get I'm being stubborn<br/>with this, but I really wanna stick the landing.")
('Jess', 'I want that design to be personal—to be more than<br/>just a fancy logo. I want it designed by someone who<br/>really, truly gets me.')
('Jess', "So I want him to draw it for me. I think that's the<br/>best thing I could ask for.")
('System', "I mean, okay, but like... You're striking it rich<br/>with this! You can afford to shell out the big bucks for<br/>a popular designer, y'know?")
('Jess', "I can, but I don't want to. This is my first record I'm<br/>making here in the capital... I want that design to be<br/>more personal.")
('System', "Man, you're overthinking this. Just let the agency<br/>handle it.")
('System', 'Their whole job is to make your job easier, so why are<br/>you fussing over this so much?')
('Jess', "I don't mind these rainy nights... They help<br/>me unwind.")
('Jess', "It's not often that Raymond, Carol, and I get some<br/>time to ourselves like this.")
('Jess', "...What I'd give for more nights like these.")
('Jess', "It's nice and quiet today... I can feel a good rhythm<br/>coming on.")
('Jess', "Raymond, Carol, and I, we've known each other since<br/>grade school. We all grew up in Anchorville.")
('Jess', "That place is nothing special...but that's what made<br/>writing music there so easy. It's so perfectly calm<br/>and chill.")
('Jess', "But now I'm here in the hustle and bustle of<br/>the capital... Those two ended up coming with<br/>me, too.")
('Jess', "I only hope they're not coming along just to<br/>appease me...")
('Jess', "I feel like the big city's getting to them.<br/>Carol changed jobs, Raymond hasn't been<br/>drawing much...")
('Jess', "I just hope they're not only doing it to appease me...")
('Jess', 'Oh, you guys.')
('Jess', 'I really appreciate how you handled my request. I can<br/>finally relax for a little bit.')
('Jess', "Now it's just me and my feelings... Go figure.<br/>Never pans out the way you expect, huh?")
('Jess', "I've still got time before the bus comes along...<br/>Maybe I'll go say hi to Raymond.")
('Jess', "He's the one who really pushed me when it came to<br/>this record deal.")
('Jess', "I really owe you two a lot. You've saved my bacon<br/>more times than I can count.")
('Jess', '...Umm, sorry. Who are you?')
('Agnès', 'Oh! Pay me no mind. Your music really spoke<br/>to me...')
('Jess', 'Really? Thanks.')
('Jess', "I'm writing the next song I'll be performing live.<br/>I'd prefer some alone time so that I can really let my<br/>thoughts flow out onto the paper.")
('Jess', 'I need a sound that really captures the discord inside<br/>my head. This maelstrom of emotions crashing<br/>against me...')
('Jess', "Maybe a change of lyrics would do... 'I sent the voice<br/>in a bottle 'cross the waves...'")
('Agnès', '(He certainly has a flair for the dramatic... Is he<br/>particularly popular?)')
('Van', "(Beats me. Might've heard him on the radio once<br/>or twice.)")
('Jess', 'Yeah, that flows better.')
('Jess', "All right... Fill in another word or two until the pause<br/>there, and then we're good.")
('Raymond', "Why, Jess?! You didn't have to protect me like that...!<br/>P-Please, help him!")
('Raymond', "One of the bracers patched him up, but he's really<br/>struggling...!")
('Fie', "Calm down. The wound isn't that deep.")
('Fie', "He's lost a lot of blood, but we can get him some<br/>medicine from the church. That should stabilize him.")
('Feri', "He'll be okay, I promise! Just stay by his side!")
('Raymond', 'I-I will! Just stay calm, Raymond... Goddess, if you<br/>can hear me...!')
('Raymond', 'Even if we drift apart a little bit, that bond will always<br/>bring us back together.')
('Raymond', 'This helped me realize that... Thank you. Thank you<br/>so much!')
('Raymond', 'And here I thought I knew everything about Jess...')
('Raymond', "I'll just be waiting here for Jess to come home.")
('Raymond', 'Good look on your investigation!')
('Raymond', '*sigh* Gotta find a way to pass the time...')
('Raymond', 'I get to see Jess perform live tonight! First time<br/>in ages.')
('Raymond', "I could barely even sleep last night. I can't help it, I'm<br/>just too excited! Gotta make sure I'm all ready...")
('Raymond', 'Maybe I should prepare a little surprise for him...?')
('Raymond', "I drew the jacket cover for Jess' new record!")
('Raymond', "It's not exactly high art, but I heard it's getting<br/>good reviews.")
('Raymond', "Here's hoping it gives his sales a little shot in the arm!")
('Raymond', "O-Oh, right, my actual job! Feel free to take some<br/>flowers with you, if you're so inclined.")
('Raymond', "It's getting pretty bleak with Creil Village...")
('Raymond', 'People keep coming by for...sympathy flowers...')
('Raymond', "It still doesn't register in my mind. How does an<br/>entire village just...disappear?")
('Raymond', 'All righty. That should pop out nicely. Just a little<br/>more over here...')
('Raymond', "I'm drawing the jacket cover for Jess' new record!")
('Raymond', "I wasn't sure how I'd make it work, but once I<br/>stopped overthinking things, the ideas just flowed<br/>right onto the paper.")
('Raymond', "It's really coming along now. I might have it<br/>done today!")
('Raymond', "Man, I haven't sat down and drawn since I graduated<br/>school, but it still calms me right down.")
('Raymond', "I should do this more often, hah. I forgot how<br/>relaxing it was. I'm gonna have to thank Jess for<br/>letting me do it!")
('Raymond', "I haven't been able to make it to any concerts lately...<br/>but I'm gonna hit up the next one for sure.")
('Raymond', 'Jess has his first big gig at the end of the year, and<br/>then his new album comes out right after.')
('Raymond', "So he's asked me to draw the cover jacket...")
('Raymond', '...but I dunno if I can pull it off. His music is some<br/>really emotional, profound stuff... Hrm...')
('Raymond', "No, bad thoughts. I can do this! If anyone knows Jess<br/>and his style, it's his childhood buddy!")
('Raymond', "I did make a new mint chocolate pudding, but...<br/>Hmm. How'd the word spread so fast?")
('Raymond', 'Sorry, Van, all sold out. Better luck next time!')
('Van', 'Ah, damn... Just my luck.')
('Risette', 'It may be prudent to visit earlier in the<br/>morning, henceforth.')
('Risette', "If you'd like, I can visit this store myself and inform<br/>you of any new products.")
('Van', 'Thanks... You know me too well, Risette. Makes me<br/>real proud to have an ace concierge like you.')
('Feri', "Wow, she's like a super secretary! I've got a lot<br/>to learn.")
('Aaron', 'Heh... Kiss-ass. Need her to buy you some<br/>dignity, too?')
('Agnès', '(Is that really a good use of her time...?)')
('Raymond', 'Ahh, sorry. I sold out super quick today.')
('Raymond', "I make 'em with my special home-grown mints!")
('Raymond', "I had Jess and Carol taste test them, and they both<br/>gave double thumbs up! Give 'em a try when you get<br/>the chance!")
('Raymond', "At the end of the day, I don't hold a candle to my<br/>sister's cooking.")
('Raymond', 'Her dishes just melt my exhaustion away every time!')
('Jess', "Don't sell yourself short, Raymond. Your sweets are<br/>pretty good, too.")
('Raymond', "Aww, thanks! You up for taste testing some<br/>more, then? Lemme show you what I've been<br/>cooking up!")
('Jess', 'Bien sur. Of course.')
('Raymond', "Hum de dum... Best to water 'em nice and good<br/>before the sun comes up.")
('Raymond', "Oh, wait no. They said there's a storm coming today.<br/>Hold the water, then!")
('Raymond', "I'm really having a blast with this job! Hard to believe<br/>it's been half a year already—I don't feel burned out<br/>at all!")
('Raymond', "Back in school, I really went all in on art and drawing<br/>and stuff... Thinking back on it, though, it wasn't<br/>really my 'thing.'")
('Raymond', "I didn't have that natural talent for it like Jess does<br/>for music.")
('Raymond', "I'm perfectly happy with this job...and our<br/>sharehouse, too. Keeps rent nice and low!")
('Raymond', "This job makes me happy and lets me live with Jess<br/>and my sister, and that's all I can ask for. Being a<br/>florist isn't so bad, after all!")
('Raymond', "Huh, usually Carol's home by now... I guess she went<br/>straight to Riverside for Jess' concert.")
('Raymond', 'She never misses a show. Talk about<br/>passionate, right? I hope Jess catches on to her<br/>eventually, for her sake.')
('Raymond', 'He can be a bit...well, oblivious to that kinda stuff.')
('Raymond', 'Maybe I should give him a little nudge? Wingman for<br/>Carol, perhaps? Eh...')
('Raymond', 'Jess and I go all the way back to school—we even<br/>shared a dorm room.')
('Raymond', "So I've come to learn how...dense he is. My sister's<br/>advances just bounce right off that thick skull of his.")
('Raymond', 'Maybe I should give him a hint or two, but...<br/>Well, maybe not...')
('Raymond', "(*sigh* My sister's just too nice. I worry he's gonna<br/>break that heart of hers.)")
('Raymond', "(She acts like she's on top of things, but she can be a<br/>bit of a ditz, actually... It's pretty cute of her, though.<br/>Heh.)")
('Raymond', "Right, Jess is heading out to work. I'll see him off,<br/>why not?")
('Raymond', 'Nice that our house is so close! Really makes our<br/>commutes easier.')
('Raymond', "Heya, Van! Welcome! Tell you what, how'd you like<br/>some gerbera daisies today?")
('Raymond', 'In the language of flowers, they symbolize progress<br/>and hope. Perfect for a nice, optimistic autumn day<br/>like this one, no?')
('Van', "Quite the sales pitch, there. No wonder you're<br/>popular with the flowery types.")
('Agnès', 'Indeed. This little shop is quite lovely!')
('Raymond', "Haha... Well, today's a bit different. Word's gotten<br/>out about what I'm whipping up...")
('Raymond', "I'm using some flower nectar to make sweet muffins!<br/>They're going on sale today.")
('Van', '*twitch* ...What muffins?')
('Raymond', "Huh? Sweet mu... Ohh, right, you've got a sweet<br/>tooth, don't you?")
('Raymond', 'They go on sale this afternoon, but do you want me<br/>to set some aside for you?')
('Van', "You're a good man, Raymond. Never forget that.")
('Agnès', "I-I'm happy for you. More desserts are, umm...never a<br/>bad thing?")
('Raymond', 'Seeing people so excited for my sweets makes all the<br/>hard work feel worth it, haha!')
('Raymond', "I'm just a part-timer, for reference—I don't own<br/>the place.")
('Raymond', "But the owner gives me free reign to do whatever.<br/>It's nice and relaxing, and pretty fun, too!")
('Raymond', "Plus it's not even a minute from my house.<br/>No commute for me—just an easy walk and some<br/>lovely flowers to take care of!")
('Jess', 'I never planned on coming back here...')
('Jess', '...and yet here I am, with my old friends in tow.<br/>It feels...strange.')
('Raymond', "Well...yeah. The heck do you mean, 'strange'?<br/>We're all home together, just as it should be.")
('Carol', "You can't just up and leave without saying anything,<br/>you big dork!")
('Jess', "I... Yeah. You're right. Sorry for worrying you.")
('Raymond', "Heh, you're a real handful sometimes, you know that?")
('Raymond', "Oh, right. I can't forget work! Now that we've found<br/>Jess, I gotta get back to business.")
('Carol', 'Ah! Right, and I need to get back to the store!')
('Carol', "Actually, though...why don't we get together for the<br/>festival tonight? I think that'd be fun! It'd help us<br/>unwind after everything.")
('Jess', 'Haha... Sounds like a plan.')
('Raymond', 'Heck yeah!')
('Raymond', "Today's probably gonna be pretty rough at<br/>work, though.")
('Carol', "Yeah, we're gonna be busy. Let's think of what kind<br/>of dinner we can make while we're all at work!")
('Raymond', "J-Jess, he... He saved me, but he's hurt! He<br/>needs help!")
('Vicar Nikolai', 'I understand. Let me tend to him. I promise you, Jess<br/>will be all right.')
('Van', "Wait, Father, what're you doing here? This ain't a<br/>good spot. You'd better get back inside—")
('Vicar Nikolai', 'Ah, thank goodness. It puts my heart at ease to see<br/>you all safe.')
('Vicar Nikolai', 'Please, worry not for me.')
('Vicar Nikolai', "It may surprise you to learn that I'm a Thaumaturge<br/>myself—I learned well from the church.")
('Vicar Nikolai', 'I can hold my own against these foul creatures.<br/>Leave this place to me, and continue on your way.')
('Van', 'Well...if you say so, I guess. Stay safe!')
('Feri', 'Please be careful!')
('Raymond', "Wait, what? Why me? You don't want someone else<br/>to draw the jacket cover?")
('Jess', 'Yeah. I want it to be you... It has to be.')
('Raymond', "Look, I get I drew a lot back in school, and it'd be fun<br/>to do some promo art like that, but...")
('Raymond', '...Umm, Jess?')
('Raymond', "(Man, it bugs me when he goes all quiet out<br/>of nowhere. I just can't tell what he's thinking.)")
('Raymond', "(This could make or break his new record... It's a<br/>really big deal! Am I really the right guy for the job?)")
('Raymond', 'I just... Give me some time to think it over. I dunno<br/>what to say...')
('Jess', "All right. I just don't see anyone else being fit for<br/>the job.")
('Raymond', '(Hah, stubborn as ever. He never changes.)')
(11076, 'Welcome! Care to buy a three-leaf clover to celebrate<br/>the festival today?')
(11076, 'You can see them on the Calvardian flag as a symbol<br/>of the revolution. They make for<br/>wonderful souvenirs!')
(11076, 'You can even take them home and display them on<br/>your porches or window sills. Feel free to pick one up<br/>for yourself!')
(11076, 'So I was going to ask Raymond to take a shift today...')
(11076, "...but he canceled on me—he said some urgent<br/>business came up. I hope he's all right...")
('Margaret', "Thank the Goddess...! *sniffle* I'm so glad you're<br/>all right!")
('Margaret', "I can't believe Harry did that... I'm so happy he<br/>was around!")
('Sheena', 'Y-Yeah. Harry saved me...')
('Sheena', "(He's always so feisty, but...that saved me.<br/>When things calm down, I wanna go thank him...)")
('Margaret', 'What in the world is going on...?')
('Margaret', 'My husband should be okay once we get his injuries<br/>patched up, but...where are the kids?')
('Margaret', 'Sheena, Mark... Paulette, Yumé... Please, PLEASE<br/>be safe...!')
('Margaret', "It's been quite some time since I sat down and had<br/>lunch at Montmart.")
('Margaret', 'I grew up together with Paulette and my husband,<br/>right here in Old Town.')
('Margaret', 'So seeing Sheena and Mark having fun together...<br/>It makes me a bit nostalgic for my own younger days.')
('Hawker', 'Happy Revolution Festival Day!')
('Robinson', 'You, too!')
('Hawker', 'Ah, the nostalgia... How long has it been since we<br/>terrorized the festival together?')
('Robinson', "Man, gotta be at least ten years... We haven't gone<br/>out and done that since the kids were born, have we?")
('Margaret', "Well, no better time than now! Let's hit the town,<br/>just like old times!")
('Margaret', "It'd be a lovely chance to catch up on things. I'd love<br/>to hear how your kids are doing these days!")
('Hawker', "Sounds good to me. Let's make this festival one to<br/>remember for us old-timers!")
('Hawker', 'Speaking of the kids, have Harry and Sheena been<br/>getting along?')
('Robinson', "Oh, they're fine. Hah, they remind me of us when we<br/>were kids. Sheena can be a bit pushy, but, well...")
('Margaret', 'And why might you be looking at me, mister?')
('Robinson', 'Err, no special reason!<br/>(Like mother, like daughter. Even their crazy smiles<br/>are the same.)')
('Margaret', "I haven't heard anything about Riverside... I hope the<br/>kids are okay...")
('Hawker', 'Damn it, if only we had a car, then I could pick them<br/>up myself!')
('Robinson', 'Looks like the monsters have died down a little...')
('Robinson', 'We just gotta pray the kids are all right.')
('Margaret', "Paulette and Yumé are out there, too... They have to<br/>be okay! They can't just...!")
('Hawker', "Let's try and get things squared away here, instead of<br/>sitting about. We need first aid, we need food...")
('Robinson', "Sounds good. I'll check up on the others!")
('Feri', "Please, wait! You shouldn't go outside yet!")
('Van', "What she said. We're heading over to Riverside after<br/>we clear things out here.")
('Van', "We'll look for Paulette and the kids once we're<br/>there, okay?")
('Robinson', 'R-Really?!')
('Hawker', 'That would be a massive help! Thank you so much!')
('Margaret', 'Thank you, from the bottom of my heart!')
('Van', "Harry's parents, yeah? Can't blame 'em for<br/>being worried.")
('Van', "Might be faster to just use my car and give 'em a<br/>ride back.")
('Feri', "Yeah! Let's give them a ride home!")
('Aaron', "Pain in the dick, but it beats having them run around<br/>and get smoked by some monster. Let's get 'er done!")
('System', 'Van and company made haste to Riverside, where<br/>they found the Old Town children, and ferried<br/>them back home.')
('Margaret', "And that's all my shopping done! Thank you for your<br/>help, Sheena.")
('Sheena', 'No problem!')
('Sheena', 'So, why DID you buy so much, Mom?')
('Margaret', "Because the festival's coming up, silly!")
('Margaret', "And as per tradition, I'm cooking up dishes for the<br/>whole neighborhood.")
('Sheena', 'Oh, right, you DO do that every year.')
('Margaret', "Why don't you try cooking something this<br/>year, Sheena?")
('Margaret', 'You could give it to someone you really like.')
('Sheena', '(Someone I really like...? But... Mmgh...)')
('Margaret', "You...don't have to think so hard about it. It can just<br/>be a friend!")
('Margaret', "You're a part of this neighborhood, too, so sooner or<br/>later, you'll be taking part anyway.")
('Sheena', 'I-I know, I know! Just...')
('Sheena', "(Ugh... I just know Harry's gonna get the wrong idea<br/>if I give him food I made myself.)")
('Lott', '*sigh* I posted the request, but is anyone really gonna<br/>take it?')
('Lott', "I'll try and loop back with Daniel.")
('Lott', "If I find anything out, I'll give you a call!")
('Carol', "I really dodged a bullet there... If I hadn't been able to<br/>apologize to him, who knows what<br/>would've happened...")
('Carol', "It's made me realize that I have to be more honest<br/>with myself...and with other people. I can't just bottle<br/>up my feelings forever.")
('Carol', "So tonight, we're putting all that to rest for good with<br/>a big old party! I'll look for a good present once I'm<br/>done with work.")
('Carol', "It's just been busy day after busy day, what with EGC<br/>prep and all.")
('Carol', 'But today, I get to slip out from work early! Heehee.')
('Carol', "Tonight, Jess has a big concert to celebrate his<br/>new record. I wouldn't miss it for the world!")
('Carol', "I'm so excited, heehee! I gotta make sure I'm<br/>all ready.")
('Carol', "Welcome. We're still open here, for the time being.")
('Carol', "We hope we don't have to close up shop, but the way<br/>things are going, we just can't say anything<br/>for certain...")
('Carol', 'Please be careful out there.')
('Carol', "At this rate, it's a coin flip whether or not the EGC<br/>goes forward at all...")
('Carol', 'Be careful out there, all right?')
('Carol', '*sniffle* Jess is just... He hits me right in the feels...!')
('Carol', "(And he's so cool. Gah, I feel like my heart's gonna<br/>jump outta my chest!)")
('Carol', "(I can't hold out much longer...!)")
('Carol', "I managed to get some time off—shocking, I know.<br/>I've racked up a lot of overtime lately, so I had<br/>some leverage.")
('Carol', "They're gonna use Jess' song as the opening for the<br/>EGC this year.")
('Carol', "That about sets it in stone: he's the next big star of<br/>the music world! Heehee.")
('Carol', "He's my little brother's best friend. He's stoic,<br/>he's reclusive... He's a bit awkward. But he has an<br/>incredible talent for music.")
('Carol', 'I almost see him as more than a friend, like...<br/>something bigger.')
('Carol', "But I've been bottling up my feelings for him for<br/>so long. My heart is aching... Is it just not meant<br/>to be?")
('Carol', "Jess is really rising up the ranks. I'm really happy for<br/>him, but...")
('Carol', "...I'm down here, and my feelings for him are only<br/>getting stronger. Will he leave me behind...?")
('Carol', "I've been bottling up my feelings for him for so long.<br/>My heart is aching... Is it just not meant to be?")
('Carol', 'The amazing thing about the EGC is that all the<br/>clothes you see the models wearing, you can go and<br/>buy for yourself.')
('Carol', "So it's more like an expo than a fashion show, and it's<br/>big PR for the brands. In the fashion industry, it's one<br/>of the biggest events of the year.")
('Carol', "I'll be doing more than just attending this year—I'm<br/>helping out as a staff member!")
('Carol', 'Just two months left until opening day... I gotta<br/>work hard. This needs to be everything that a girl<br/>could dream of!')
('Carol', 'Oh, Raymond. He can be so spoiled at times...')
('Carol', "(But he helps keep Jess and I in check... I'm really<br/>thankful for that. I dunno what I'd do without him.)")
('Carol', '(He makes sure Jess eats properly, too...) A-Ahem!')
('Carol', "Big sisters can cook, too! I'll whip up something<br/>nice today.")
('Carol', "Welcome... Ah, you're the group I heard about!")
('Agnès', 'If memory serves, you live in that sharehouse, right?')
('Feri', 'Umm, oh! You live in that sharehouse place in Old<br/>Town, right?')
('Van', "You're in that sharehouse, yeah? Didn't realize you<br/>worked here.")
('Carol', "Heehee, yup! I'm the clerk here at Erland.")
('Carol', 'Let me just... Ahem! Thank you for browsing our<br/>products today. If you need help picking out a look,<br/>we can curate a selection just for you!')
('Carol', "We're here to help you find that perfect look. If you<br/>have any questions, you need only ask!")
('Aaron', "Oho. Some bougie brands here. Maybe I'll find<br/>something on clearance.")
('Van', "Haha. Sure, why not? I'll take a look around.")
('Carol', "Our manager also helped launch the Edith Girls'<br/>Collection, or EGC. Now it's the biggest fashion<br/>event in the capital!")
('Carol', 'That earned her the moniker of Dream Weaver, both<br/>for her fashion sense and for her own beauty.')
('Carol', "She's every bit as knowledgeable as the name<br/>implies, heehee. She's still an EGC mainstay.")
('Carol', 'Whew, that was rough! I ran into a couple snags<br/>there, but I still got all my work done for the day!')
('Carol', "Wow, he's really full of energy!")
('Carol', "He's been kinda low energy lately...but not anymore!<br/>He's on fire today!")
('Carol', "He was looking really out of it the other day. I can't<br/>deny I was worried...but I guess all's well now!")
('Carol', 'Oh, Raymond, have you seen Jess, by chance?')
('Raymond', "Can't say I have. He didn't drop by the store today.")
('Raymond', "He has that gig tonight, right? Maybe he's off getting<br/>himself ready.")
('Carol', 'Right, yeah. That makes sense.')
('Carol', '*sigh* Oh, Jess...')
('Carol', "He's really not letting the fame get to his head—quite<br/>the opposite. He's as humble as he ever was...<br/>Almost too much.")
('Carol', 'Sometimes I worry about him, but, well...that<br/>modesty is what makes Jess, Jess.')
('Carol', "Now then, I think I'll whip us up a nice little lunch!")
('Carol', "I know that we're all adults, so we're expected to cook<br/>for ourselves...")
('Carol', "...but we're all friends, and we all need to eat.<br/>What's wrong with making stuff for the three of us?")
('Carol', "It's not like I'm giving myself extra work—I'd just<br/>have a ton of leftovers to eat by myself, otherwise!<br/>Now, what should I make...?")
('Carol', 'Wow, those are some powerful notes... Jess is really<br/>putting his all into it. I hope he likes how it<br/>turns out...')
('Carol', "Ahem! Not to say you shouldn't go bother him, but<br/>do be considerate, okay?")
('Carol', "He can be a bit delicate at times, but I guess that's<br/>just common to a lot of artists.")
('Jess', "All right, I'm off.")
('Carol', "Break a leg, rock star! Once I'm done with work for<br/>the day, I'll head right on over to watch!")
('Jess', "Thank you, but...really, you don't have to do that<br/>for me. I know you're plenty busy—")
('Carol', "Wha...? Why WOULDN'T I go to your concert?<br/>Jess, I love... Eep!")
('Carol', 'Your performances! I love your performances!')
('Jess', "I, err... I see. Well...thanks. I'll make sure you love<br/>what you hear.")
('Carol', 'Umm... What do you mean by that?')
('Jess', "I mean... That's just how I feel. I want to make<br/>you happy.")
('Jess', "I owe the both of you so much for helping me get<br/>here, so that's why...")
('Jess', "...Sorry. Forget it. I'm rambling.")
('Carol', "No, I... Jess, you can tell me. What's on your mind?")
('Van', '(Well, this is awkward.)')
('Van', '(None of my business, anyway. Good luck, lovebirds.)')
('Carol', 'Jess! Jess, hang in there!')
('Jess', "I'm...okay... It's good that...you're all right...")
('Carol', "I-It's okay, don't talk! Just lie down there, okay?")
('Jess', 'Thank you...so much... Carol... For every...thing...')
('Jess', "N-No! Please, don't say that! Y-You're gonna be<br/>fine, right? Right?! J-Jess!")
('Feri', '(Is he gonna make it...?)')
('Van', "(His vitals look okay, but he's losin' a ton of blood.<br/>We gotta get him patched up, stat.)")
('Van', "(The hospitals are all haywire, though... Get him to<br/>Father Nikolai. He's our best bet.)")
('Jess', 'I always...knew...deep down...')
('Carol', "Jess, please! Don't waste your energy!<br/>Just sit still...!")
('Raymond', 'Hiya, Carol! Come to check on little old me?')
('Carol', 'Yeah, I... Hey! How many times have I told you to<br/>stop being all cutesy like that? Especially in public!')
('Carol', "I just don't want people getting the wrong idea!<br/>I mean... Mmgh...")
('Raymond', 'I... Huh?')
('Carol', "Ahem! A-Anyway, I'm off to work.")
('Carol', "One of my coworkers caught a cold, so I have to<br/>come in. Can't leave the place short-staffed.")
('Raymond', 'Aww, boo... Well, nothing we can do about that,<br/>I guess.')
('Raymond', "Just don't overwork yourself. I'll make dinner around<br/>the usual time, okay?")
('Carol', 'Of course! Thank you for that. Could you be a<br/>darling and handle some of that housework<br/>today, too?')
('Raymond', 'Phew! I really did the works today.')
('Raymond', 'Oh, Carol! Can you whip up some hot cocoa,<br/>pretty please? Oh, and the radio on the usual<br/>station, too? Thanks a million!')
('Carol', 'Well, sure! Sounds like somebody wants to be<br/>spoiled today.')
('Carol', "Well, c'est la vie. I'll make some of my special gratin<br/>tonight, just for you!")
('Raymond', "Thank youuu! Man, today's been so awesome!")
('Jess', 'Heh... Man, you never change.')
('Étoile', 'Mrowr! Ffft!')
('Van', "Looks like the cats're all hunkerin' down, too.")
('Feri', "I'm glad they're okay, but they look really<br/>stressed out...")
('Feri', 'We have to get to the bottom of this!')
('Van', "Agreed. Let's round up everybody else first!")
('Étoile', 'Rawrr... MrrrRRAWWW...')
('Étoile', 'Mrow! Mreowwr...!')
('Van', "Still don't wanna play nice, huh?")
('Van', "Maybe the festival's got him all freaked out. Or he's<br/>just watchin' it all from his perch.")
('Étoile', 'Mrow! Mreowwwr...!')
('Étoile', 'Mreooow... Mrawr!')
('Van', "Well, what're they all doin' together?")
('Étoile', 'Meow! Mrrow!')
(15039, 'Mrooowr!')
('Judith', "Holy...! What's with all these cats?! I've never seen so<br/>many in one place before...")
('Agnès', "They appear awfully cautious. Perhaps they've<br/>sensed something...")
('Van', "I mean, all of us humans are freakin' out—I think<br/>they're pickin' up on us. Clever little...")
('Étoile', 'Mrow! Mrowwwr!')
(15039, 'Mrooowr!')
('Étoile', '*hiss*')
('Van', '(Heh. He looks like a bush with his hair on end.<br/>Guess this is his turf and he wants us gone?)')
('Van', 'Huh? That the...')
('Étoile', 'Mrrrrr... RRRRROWR! *HISS*')
('Quatre', "He seems awfully hostile toward XEROS. He exudes<br/>this...aura? I'm not sure how to put it.")
('Agnès', "His fur is all puffed out, like he's trying to make<br/>himself look bigger. Does he think XEROS is some<br/>kind of threat?")
('Van', "Yup, he's got cattitude. Bein' the head honcho, he<br/>feels the need to scare people out of his turf.")
('Étoile', 'Mrow! Rrrawr!')
('Étoile', 'Mrowr?!')
('Étoile', '*HISS*')
('Van', 'Okay, okay. Sorry.')
('Van', '(I see that cat every now and then. Guess this is<br/>his turf.)')
('Étoile', 'Mrowr! *hiss*')

('Van', "Where'd you get this image?")
('Agnès', "It was...well, it wasn't through an ordinary search<br/>engine, I'll say that.")
('Agnès', 'Records indicate it was stolen from an antique shop<br/>in the city a week ago.')
('Van', "I'm gonna assume you mean a special search app<br/>based on a P4 protocol exploit.")
('Van', "Not what I was expectin'...")
('Agnès', 'Umm...')
('Van', "I'll give it to you straight: take this one to the cops or<br/>the guild.")
('Van', "I don't know what kinda orbment this is, but it looks<br/>like it's got a whole lot of historical value.")
('Van', "And you mentioned it was stolen. Likely some seedy<br/>folks're involved at this point.")
('Van', "'Sides, searching for a memento of a relative sounds<br/>like somethin' those suckers at the guild would eat<br/>right up.")
('Agnès', 'S-So you say, but...')
('Agnès', "I can't. I just can't.")
('Agnès', "I can't go to the police with this—and the guild is<br/>even more out of the question.")
('Agnès', '...')
('Van', "*sigh* If you say so... Oh, I guess I should've put out<br/>somethin' to eat with the tea, huh?")
('Agnès', 'Oh! Speaking of food!')
('Agnès', 'This is from a popular cakery near our dorm.')
('Agnès', "They only make twenty of them a day, and they're<br/>supposed to be really goo—")
('Van', "This is Andalucía's late summer<br/>limited-time edition!")
('Van', 'The specially made tart covered in violette<br/>de sollies figs from Ored and honey!')
('Agnès', 'You...are something of an expert, I see.')
('Van', '...')
('Agnès', 'Umm...')
('Van', 'I just wanna make this clear.')
('Van', "I'm NOT doing this 'cause I couldn't say no to<br/>that tart. Got it?")
('Agnès', 'If you say so...')
('Agnès', 'You must be a connoisseur of sweets, huh?')
('Agnès', 'I thought you would wolf it down right on the spot,<br/>but you put it in the fridge with all the care given to a<br/>family heirloom.')
('Van', "It's Andalucía! What kinda sick freak wouldn't save it<br/>for an end-of-the-day treat?")
('Van', "Ohh, I'm so jealous you live near that place... Must be<br/>nice bein' a student.")
('Agnès', 'Ahaha... Even we have a hard time getting the<br/>limited-time ones, to be honest.')
('Agnès', 'So, Mr. Arkride...')
('Agnès', '...are you really accepting my job, then?')
('Van', "I'm not gonna turn it down now—but that tart only<br/>got you in the front door.")
('Van', "You're still gonna have to pay my usual rate, and<br/>that's a hell of a lot more than what the guild charges.")
('Agnès', "That's fine. I have the money.")
('Agnès', 'Now, where are we going first?')
('Van', "To see an old geezer who knows more about thievin'<br/>than most.")
('Van', "He's as skeezy as you get, but there's no better guy in<br/>times like these. Should be in the 6th District right<br/>about now.")
('Agnès', 'Near the river?')
('Agnès', 'Are we taking the subway, then?')
('Van', "Nah. The bus'll get us there at this hour.")
('Van', "I know it's not even eleven, but I want this job done<br/>before end of day so I can toast our success with Miss<br/>Good Lookin' in the fridge.")
('Agnès', 'Heehee.')
('Agnès', "Then I'm counting on you, Mr. Arkride.")
('Van', 'Same to you.')
('Van', "Van's fine, by the way.")
('Agnès', "If you're sure...")
('Agnès', "Then why don't you call me Agnès?")
('System', 'Received various outfits for the party as a New<br/>Game+ bonus.')
('Agnès', "Oh! There's the bus stop.")
('Van', "Yeah. The next one should be here soon—then we're a<br/>hop, a skip, and a jump away to the Riverside District.")
('Van', "(Probably got time to grab somethin' from the kiosk<br/>if we need to.)")

(500, 'Montmart, Eighth District')
('Van', "Damn. Guess I'm goin' without dinner.")
('Van', 'You even good to be out this late? I thought students<br/>had a curfew.')
('Agnès', "That's kind of you to think of me, but I received<br/>permission to be out this late beforehand.")
('Agnès', "Never mind my curfew. Won't you let me see to<br/>your arm?")
('Agnès', 'Do you have a first aid kit in the office?')
('Van', 'I do, but...')
('Agnès', 'It looks like it started healing on its own.')
('Van', "I know it wasn't THAT bad in the first place...")
('Van', "...but it's still healing way too fast for it to be normal.<br/>Wonder if I got that orbment or turnin' into a<br/>monster to thank for this.")
('Agnès', '...')
('Agnès', 'This all began with those diaries.')
('Agnès', 'They were passed down from my great-grandfather to<br/>my grandmother, and then down to my mother until<br/>her death four years ago.')
('Agnès', 'As you guessed, my great-grandfather is the famous<br/>Professor Epstein.')
('Agnès', 'It was known at the time that he had an adopted<br/>daughter, but she went missing very suddenly after he<br/>passed away.')
('Agnès', 'By the sound of it, something compelled her to shy<br/>away from the public eye.')
('Agnès', "I don't know what that something was. It wasn't<br/>written in the letter she left me.")
('Agnès', 'Then after my mother died, my father began to lose<br/>himself in his work...')
('Agnès', '...and now all alone, I became more and more<br/>captivated by the many diaries that were left behind.')
('Agnès', "They weren't filled with complex formulae or<br/>specialist knowledge or things like that.")
('Agnès', 'Instead, they were about who he was as a person.<br/>What he was like, what his philosophies were, what<br/>he valued most in life.')
('Agnès', 'He wrote about the little things that colored his days,<br/>his bonds with his loved ones, his time spent with<br/>his disciples...')
('Agnès', 'I could see through every word written that he was a<br/>kind, warm-hearted man with a good sense of humor.<br/>A man I could respect a great deal.')
('Agnès', 'I was so happy to have his writings so I could peer<br/>into his world, just like my mother and grandmother<br/>before me.')
('Agnès', 'And before I knew it, those diaries became my most<br/>treasured possessions.')
('Agnès', 'However...')
('Agnès', '...at the end of his final entry, on the very last page, I<br/>found a shocking message.')
('Agnès', "It said: 'Recover the Oct-Geneses before the<br/>year 120X.'")
('Agnès', "'Else all we know will come to an end.'")
('Van', 'Pretty ominous thing to write down.')
('Agnès', 'It could have been a delusion that came to him in the<br/>winter of his years.')
('Agnès', 'But I began to feel that it was why his diaries had<br/>been passed down to me...')
('Agnès', '...and as the days wore on, my desire to do something<br/>to avert the end he foretold grew stronger<br/>and stronger.')
('Agnès', "But I knew I couldn't go public with any of it.<br/>Not with my grandmother's disappearance.")
('Agnès', 'That led me to enroll at Aramis Academy, where I<br/>met a very dependable upperclassman.')
('Agnès', 'Her advice took me to the orbal net, and that led me<br/>to you.')
('Agnès', 'I just never thought when I started all of this that<br/>these would be the consequences...')
('Agnès', 'That someone would die... That you would be put in<br/>so much danger...')
('Van', '...')
('Van', "Well, you managed to get one of 'em.")
('Van', "Even if there're still seven more out there, you could<br/>always call it quits here.")
('Agnès', "I can't. Not when they're what connect me to<br/>my family.")
('Agnès', 'Not when I now know they really exist, and not after<br/>seeing that final entry.')
('Agnès', "I can't look away from all of that.")
('Agnès', 'Here. This 50,000 mira is everything I was able to<br/>gather for this.')
('Agnès', "Please, accept it as compensation for all the help<br/>you've given me.")
('Van', '...I thought I told you my rate.')
('Agnès', "Well, umm...you did, but I don't feel that it<br/>accounted for that injury you sustained because of me.")
('Agnès', 'I intend to find the remaining seven on my own.')
('Agnès', "I don't want anyone else to get hurt because of<br/>my problems. Oh! But I'll be very careful about it!<br/>Promise!")
('Van', 'Heh.')
('Agnès', 'Huh?')
('Van', "My rate's 1,000 mira an hour, excluding other<br/>necessary expenses.")
('Van', "I'll bump it up a little 'cause of the danger involved,<br/>but you rolled up your sleeves more than your<br/>average client.")
('Van', "You put yourself in danger to help me. Any more<br/>than 10,000 would be rippin' you off.")
('Van', "This is how the world of work is. Good thing you're<br/>still in school, 'cause you got a lot to learn.")
('Agnès', 'M-Maybe, but still...')
('Agnès', "I'm sorry. I just feel you've taken on a lot more than<br/>you bargained for from start to finish.")
('Van', "To be honest, that whole turnin' into a monster<br/>thing's got my interest piqued.")
('Van', "So it wouldn't feel right to ask you for even more mira<br/>with how we're gonna keep this thing goin'.")
('Agnès', 'What do you...?')
('Van', "Unless you decide to give up altogether, I'll pitch in<br/>however I can from here on out.")
('Van', 'In exchange, you can share any info you got on the<br/>Geneses or anything those diaries say.')
('Van', "How's that sound?")
('Agnès', '...')
('Agnès', "Umm... Correct me if I'm wrong, but...")
('Agnès', '...a-are you telling me that even though you know it<br/>might be dangerous...')
('Agnès', "...you're going to help me search for the other seven...<br/>without taking additional compensation?")
('Van', "Hey, info's good compensation.")
('Van', "I ain't takin' a single mira, though.")
('Van', "I'm gonna need you to get more used to real<br/>combat, too. For your own safety.")
('Van', "Can't have you leavin' yourself wide open and all that<br/>good stuff—and I'm gonna drill it into you until<br/>you're up to snuff.")
('Agnès', "I-I don't know...")
('Agnès', "(This doesn't sound like a fair trade at all. I'm the<br/>only one benefitting here...)")
('Agnès', 'Well, if you insist, Van, then thank you very much.<br/>Having your support means a lot to me.')
('Van', "Yeah, well, I'll be countin' on you, too.")
('Van', "All right. Now that today's done and dusted...time for<br/>my hard-earned reward!")
('Van', "I've been waitin' for my Andalucía fig and honey tart<br/>all day!")
('Van', "I was gonna scarf it down all by myself, but you<br/>pulled your weight today, so let's go half-half.")
('Agnès', 'Ahaha... Thank you.')
('Agnès', 'Oh! But I still want to say...')
('Agnès', '...it really does bother me just how much I benefit<br/>from this arrangement compared to you.')
('Agnès', 'I was thinking of a way to even it out and thought,<br/>you know, how about I work here part time?')
('Van', '...? You wanna WHAT?!')
('Agnès', "You seem to be so busy that I can't imagine how you<br/>find the time to clean up around here...")
('Agnès', "I'm also good at secretarial work, too, so I'm sure I'd<br/>be a big help with sorting paperwork and whatever<br/>else you need.")
('Agnès', 'Just a standard wage is fine. Or even no wage!<br/>Unpaid is totally fine!')
('Van', "I-I can't do that! Haven't you ever heard of<br/>labor laws?")
('Van', 'A-And forget that! This whole idea is crazy!')
('Van', 'How did me hiring you even get into your head?!')
('Agnès', "Well, it's because you won't accept any mira from me.")
('Agnès', "I understand you have your own way of doing things,<br/>but I have my own pride to satisfy, you know.<br/>You'll just have to compromise.")
('Van', '*flabbergasted sputtering*')
('Agnès', "Now, let me just cut this tart into two so we can dig<br/>in and enjoy! Don't worry—I'll make sure you get the<br/>bigger portion.")
('Agnès', 'And where do you keep your coffee beans? Oh!<br/>There they are.')

('Van', "The plan today's gonna involve you touring around<br/>with me so you can get a visual on all of the above.")

('Van', "Might feel like an eternity until you graduate, but the<br/>second you cross twenty, you'll be walkin' with your<br/>cane like an old codger in no time.")
('Agnès', "Ahaha... Oh, I didn't say being in your twenties<br/>was old. Just that you were older than me.")
('Agnès', "Circling back to what we were talking about before,<br/>you don't have to worry about me. I'm confident I can<br/>handle any task you give me.")
('Van', "Heh. I'll be the judge of that.")
('Van', "We'll be stickin' to three of the city's districts.")
('Van', "First, I'll show you around Old Town where we are<br/>now, which is the Eighth District.")

('Paulette', "Getting ready for a hard day's work?")
('Agnès', "That's right. Oh! Thank you!")
('Van', "I've put her on a trial period to start with.")

('Paulette', "Don't overdo it today—and make sure you're back in<br/>time for dinner.")

('Agnès', 'Ahh. I do.')
('Agnès', 'You told me to keep it on me at all times to prevent it<br/>from being stolen.')

('Agnès', 'Heehee. Right.')
('Agnès', 'And speaking of...shall we?')
('Van', 'We shall. Then let the workday begin.')
('Agnès', "So, what's the first order of business?")
('Van', "The first thing I do every day I'm workin' is check the<br/>notice boards around the city.")
('Van', "There's one here in Old Town, so let's go check that<br/>one out for starters.")
('Agnès', 'Got it!')
('Van', 'Oh, we should probably go talk to Victor before we<br/>head out, though.')
('Van', 'We should pay a visit to the repair shop down the<br/>alley out front, too.')
('Agnès', 'Understood. Victor first, then?')
('Agnès', 'After which we can check the notice board and visit<br/>the repair shop. Got it.')
('System', 'You can now use the Travel menu.')
('Van', '(Should I make my move?)')
('Agnès', 'How adorable...')
('Van', 'The hell? A kid?')
('Feri', "I can't believe I let a civilian get the better of me.")
('Feri', "You knew I was tailing you and led me here on<br/>purpose, didn't you?")
('Van', "Well, I knew I wasn't gonna lose you, so this was the<br/>next best thing.")
('Van', 'That was a form of active camo using shards.<br/>Same kinda thing RAMDAs can do—just<br/>works different.')
('Agnès', 'Y-You can do that with shards, too?')
('Feri', 'You ARE the real deal, huh? Actually, even realer<br/>than real.')
('Feri', 'Glad I decided to come even with what Abi said.')
('Agnès', "'Abi'? If I recall, that means...")
('Van', "It's 'Father.' From a dialect in the Central East.")
('Van', "With how fast you are and the way you're dressed, are<br/>you—")
('Van', "Waaait a minute... I think I just realized<br/>somethin' else.")
('Agnès', "What's wrong?")
('Van', 'How are you a jaeger in the Kruga corps at your age?')
('Van', "You're one hell of a girl.")
('Agnès', 'What?!')
(40301, "I'm the eldest daughter of the Warriors of Kruga's<br/>vice chief, Ferida Al-Fayed.")
(40301, 'I came here to ask for your help, Mr. Arkride.<br/>Could we go somewhere to talk?')
('Agnès', 'This is my first time hearing about the Warriors<br/>of Kruga.')
('Agnès', "So you're from just below the Ishgal Mountains in the<br/>Central East?")
('Feri', 'Along the northern edge of the Central East, yeah.<br/>We see ourselves as—and live a lifestyle befitting<br/>of—warriors.')
('Feri', 'We revere flames and the Goddess Arusha.')
('Van', 'Their whole tribe forms one major corps that serves<br/>to rep the whole Central East.')
('Van', "They're very proud and value their traditions, though,<br/>so they won't take on any jobs they deem immoral.")
('Van', "And if you're surprised people so upstanding would<br/>let a kid fight—well, me, too.")
('Feri', "Heehee. Oh, please. I'm not a full-fledged warrior<br/>like Abi yet.")
('Feri', "But it's nice to hear you think of me as one.")
('Van', "(Innocent little thing, isn't she?)")
('Agnès', '(Ahaha. Yes, she strikes me as very pure of heart.)')
('Agnès', "So you're looking for another jaeger corps, is<br/>that right?")
('Agnès', "One called 'Eisenschild'?")
('Van', "They're another famous high-ranking corps in<br/>Central Zemuria.")
('Van', 'They work outta the free cities to the north and got a<br/>lot of former soldiers in their ranks.')
('Van', "Fairly decent group for a jaeger corps, too. They take<br/>care of their city's defenses and stuff.")
('Agnès', "That's interesting. I didn't know there were so many<br/>different kinds of jaeger corps.")
('Feri', "We've clashed against the Eisenschild a lot over<br/>the years.")
('Feri', 'Our last one was around a couple weeks ago in a<br/>proxy war against them.')
('Feri', 'We eventually settled that, and both sides left the<br/>battlefield, but...')
('Feri', "...from what I've heard, one unit of the Eisenschild's<br/>jaegers still hasn't returned home yet.")
('Van', "Huh. And you're sure they didn't take on another job<br/>on the way back, right?")
('Feri', "We're sure. Their regimental commander contacted<br/>our village directly asking if we knew anything.")
('Feri', "Abi—our vice chief—has been so worried that he's<br/>doing just about everything he can to find them.")
('Van', 'Yeah? That so...?')
('Agnès', "Sorry. I'm a little confused.")
('Agnès', "Didn't you say that both of your corps fought as<br/>enemies only a couple weeks ago?")
('Feri', 'Hmm? I did. Why?')
('Van', "It's a jaeger thing. Don't worry about it.")
('Van', "Soon as the fighting stops, it's water under the bridge<br/>for them.")
('Van', "It's not uncommon for them to be enemies on one job<br/>and allies on the next.")
('Agnès', 'How unusual...')
('Feri', "I, uhh...didn't mean to confuse you.")
('Feri', "But he's right. We don't bear them any ill will.")
('Feri', 'The leader of the unit that vanished has actually<br/>always been real good to me.')
('Van', 'Really?')
('Agnès', 'What kind of person are they?')
('Feri', "Her name's Aida. She's one of the most capable<br/>jaegers in her corps.")
('Feri', "We've fought as allies and as enemies a lot since I<br/>first became a warrior two years ago.")
('Feri', 'She also teaches me all kinds of things on our off days<br/>or when our corps train together, too.')
('Feri', "It would have been easy to ignore someone as young<br/>as me, but she's been nothing but a true friend.")
('Feri', "Or maybe even a sister. I already have an older<br/>brother, but if I had to picture what an older sister<br/>would be like, it'd be her.")
('Feri', "She's very, very important to me.")
('Feri', "So of course I wanted to join in on the search party<br/>for her...but they wouldn't let me.")
('Feri', "Abi said it was because I'm still only thirteen and<br/>don't know anything outside of war and our village.")
('Van', 'Makes sense.')
('Agnès', "So that's why you came all the way to Calvard?<br/>Because you couldn't give up?")
('Feri', "That's right. I left on my own and rode on buses and<br/>trains for the first time to get here.")
('Feri', "We know that Aida's unit came through Calvard on<br/>their way home...")
('Feri', "...so if they really have gone missing, the odds are<br/>they're somewhere in this country.")
('Feri', "As for why I came to you, I've heard about you from<br/>the warriors in my village.")
('Feri', "They told me about a spriggan in Calvard's capital<br/>who was willing to lend an ear to even jaegers like us.")
('Feri', 'This is a lump of argem.')
('Feri', 'Will this be enough to cover your fees for helping me<br/>find Aida?')
('Feri', "Ahh! Don't worry—I got this legitimately through<br/>a job.")
('Agnès', "But that's...")
('Van', "You kiddin' me? A lump that big could fetch around<br/>100,000 mira, easy.")
('Van', 'Well, we can talk money stuff later.')
('Van', "But just to be upfront, our rate's 1,000 mira an hour,<br/>excluding other necessary expenses.")
('Van', "I'm not in the market for a hundred-hour job.")
('Feri', 'Wh-What do you...?')
('Agnès', "Heehee. You don't have to make it sound like you're<br/>turning her down.")
('Agnès', "You're still going to help her, aren't you?")
('Van', "Don't make it sound like an easy yes. This one seems<br/>like a little more trouble than we can afford to handle.")
('Van', 'Everything about it screams trouble, in fact.')
('Van', "And we still got your case to work on, too, so can't<br/>just drop everything for some far-off pl—")
('Agnès', '...What?')
('Feri', 'Huh? Your bag is glowing.')
('Van', 'Great timing...')
('Agnès', '...My great-grandfather wrote that the Eight Geneses<br/>are drawn to one another.')
('Agnès', "This is the first time I've seen it react this way—and<br/>that it just happened to do so now...")
('Van', 'Bah. Wish I could chalk it up to superstitious<br/>bull, but...')
('Feri', "I'm...not sure what's going on. It's really pretty, but<br/>what is it?")
('Agnès', "It's a memento of my great-grandfather that has a<br/>special power.")
('Agnès', 'And it just might help us find Aida.')
('Feri', 'Y-You really think so?!')
('Van', 'Easy, there!')
('Van', "I'm not gonna commit to the job just yet. First, I need<br/>a better hold on the overall situation.")
('Van', 'Can you help fill in some gaps for us?')
('Feri', 'Oh... Yeah! Of course I can!')
('Agnès', 'While this certainly is a lot of useful information...')
('Agnès', "...it's all so fragmented that it doesn't feel like it will<br/>bring us much closer to finding what we're<br/>looking for.")
('Feri', 'Unfortunately...')
('Feri', "I feel like it's only just starting to set in how big this<br/>country is.")
('Feri', "I knew it was big from looking at maps, but that<br/>didn't tell me just how many groups and forces were<br/>at work.")
('Van', "Well, it's not one of the two big powerhouses of the<br/>continent for nothin'. Hell, it takes the number one<br/>spot now.")
('Van', 'We got plenty of corps of our own based here.')
('Van', 'Then we got syndicates, mafias, and other shady<br/>groups and spies from abroad lurking around<br/>every corner.')
('Feri', "I guess Aida would've had to conceal her identity<br/>while passing through here.")
('Feri', 'Which will make it even more difficult to find her...')
('Agnès', "Don't worry! Van's the perfect man for the job!")
('Agnès', "He has all kinds of shady connections on call<br/>around here. ...Don't you?")
('Van', "Just all kindsa fine blurtin' that out now, huh...?")
('Kincaid', "Well, hello, Van. I've been expecting your call.")
('Feri', '...?')
('Agnès', '(That sounds like...)')
('Van', 'Bah. Was a 50-50 chance it was you.')
('Van', 'You know exactly who my next client is, then, huh?')
('Kincaid', "Indeed. Ferida Al-Fayed, daughter of the Warriors of<br/>Kruga's vice chief.")
('Kincaid', 'I also know she wants your help in finding a missing<br/>jaeger corps.')
('Feri', '...?!')
('Agnès', 'H-How do you...?')
('Van', "I'm gonna say they've been on her ever since she<br/>arrived in the capital. The CID's database isn't just<br/>for show.")
('Van', "But if you know exactly what she's here for...")
('Van', '...then you probably played a part in why the corps<br/>has gone AWOL, right?')
('Feri', '...')
('Agnès', 'Is that really true...?')
('Kincaid', "I'd be lying if I said it isn't.")
('Kincaid', 'We caught wind of their movements ten days ago on<br/>their way back to the free cities via Calvard.')
('Kincaid', 'As you well know, there are no laws that prohibit<br/>jaeger corps from entering or leaving the country.')
('Kincaid', 'However, we in the CID make it our business to<br/>know exactly what each corps is doing while here.')
('Kincaid', "We also take advantage of particularly capable units<br/>to 'train' our own Special Ops division from time<br/>to time.")
('Feri', '...?!')
('Agnès', 'S-Special Ops division?')
('Van', 'Hercules, right?')
('Van', 'Heard it was given a serious overhaul after its screwup<br/>against the Empire a couple years back.')
('Kincaid', "The capabilities of each individual unit differ greatly<br/>even now, I'm afraid.")
('Kincaid', 'All this is to say, we set one of the more promising<br/>units against Aida the Flameeater and her corps.')
('Kincaid', 'I would note that the goal of this operation was to<br/>merely encircle her unit—not to engage in combat.')
('Kincaid', 'And while the operation started off on the right foot,<br/>she managed to break through our lines and escape.')
('Kincaid', "I can't say the news came as any surprise to me,<br/>knowing the corps she was in before.")
('Van', "Heh. Yeah, I've heard the rumors.")
('Agnès', 'Still, this was all ten days ago? I understand the initial<br/>trouble that happened, but...')
('Feri', "She hasn't been captured since then, has she?")
('Kincaid', "That is correct. I'll send you our data on where we<br/>cornered her, but beyond that, I've told you all that<br/>I know.")
('Kincaid', 'Consider this my way of repaying my debt to you<br/>from the other day. I leave the rest to you.')
('Van', "H-Hey! Don't hang up on—")
('Van', 'Come on... They just HAD to stick their fingers in<br/>this pie, huh?')
('Agnès', 'So it seems...')
('Feri', "The CID is Calvard's intelligence division, right?")
('Feri', "So even they couldn't catch her... Heehee. She's<br/>so awesome.")
('Van', 'Way to think positive, kiddo.')
('Van', "Well, I feel like we can narrow down where she could<br/>be now. Let's review what we've got so far again.")
('Van', 'This should do it.')
('Van', "This is where the CID tried and failed to corner<br/>Aida's corps.")
('Van', "After we eliminate where the CID's unit was, we can<br/>narrow down their escape route to three<br/>possible locations.")
('Van', 'Which one do you think is the most likely?')
('Agnès', 'Hmm...')
('Feri', 'With the surrounding terrain and villages, I think<br/>they returned via...')
('Van', "Can't see 'em taking a direct route with the CID hot<br/>on their tail.")
('Van', "Any other day I'd consider Messeldam, but it's got<br/>too many eyes on it after that bomb threat last month.")
('Van', "Any other day I'd consider Messeldam, but it's got<br/>too many eyes on it after that bomb threat last month.")
('Van', "Can't see 'em taking a direct route with the CID hot<br/>on their tail.")
('Van', "Nice thinkin'.")
('Van', 'This route will open up two—even four times the<br/>options to get back home.')
('Van', "Plus it makes sense they'd wanna go through another<br/>country to get the CID off their back.")
('Van', 'Now, if they took this route here, they most likely<br/>stopped off at...')
('Feri', 'Creil Village... Oh, hey!')
('Agnès', "It's a farming village to the northwest known for its<br/>gorgeous rustic scenery.")
('Agnès', "I've never been there myself, but it sounds like it rings<br/>a bell for you, Feri.")
('Feri', "It does. Aida's told me about it before.")
('Feri', "She said that public transportation is well built there<br/>even though it's so rural, so it's a good spot<br/>to resupply...")
('Feri', "...and that I should come visit since the scenery is so<br/>pretty and the food's so good.")
('Agnès', 'I see... Oh!')
('Van', 'Think that settles it.')
('Van', "Tomorrow morning, we make for Creil. I can almost<br/>bet we'll find somethin' there.")
('Van', "You can stay up in the third floor for tonight. I'll give<br/>a heads up to our landlords.")
('System', 'Earned')
(500, 'September 7th, 6:04AM')
('Feri', 'Wow!')
('Agnès', 'Your truck is huge!')
('Van', "Oh, yeah. She's a big girl.")
(500, '1204 Ingert Nightbreaker Pickup Truck')
('Van', "Of the four big car manufacturers in Calvard, Ingert's<br/>got the best rep when it comes to sports cars.")
('Van', "This here's the best one they ever made—and I went<br/>ham tunin' her up even further.")
('Van', "You can see what I mean at the front and in the<br/>suspension system where I've—")
('Agnès', 'Umm...')
('Feri', "I can't follow a word you're saying, but it sure<br/>looks nice!")
('Van', "*sigh* Should've known you wouldn't be able to<br/>appreciate a man's one true love.")
('Van', "You wanna tell me why women only wanna date guys<br/>with rides but don't wanna hear a word ABOUT<br/>said rides? Man...")
('Agnès', "Careful painting all women with that excessively large<br/>brush you've got there...")
('Agnès', "(Even if it's true that I don't care about cars at all.)")
('Feri', "Well, whatever 'tuning' is, I'm sure it's made your<br/>truck look very cool.")
('Van', 'Ugh... Just get in and be quiet before you make<br/>me cry!')
('Victor', "What's all this whining first thing in the morning?")
('Feri', "Oh! You're the kind people who gave me<br/>food yesterday!")
('Van', 'Hey, guys.')
('Agnès', 'Did you really come all the way out here just to see<br/>us off?')
('Yumé', 'Mmm... Yeah...')
('Yumé', 'Mostly for Agnès and Feri, but...Van, too, I guess.')
('Feri', 'Aww...')
('Van', 'I heard that.')
('Paulette', 'We also wanted to bring you this.')
('Paulette', "It's got sandwiches, milk, and coffee. I'm sure you<br/>haven't had much time for breakfast this morning.")
('Van', 'Nice. Thanks.')
('Agnès', "Oh, you really shouldn't have... Thank you so much!")
('Feri', 'And after you did so much for me yesterday, too...')
('Feri', "I really don't know how to thank you.")
('Paulette', 'Heehee. Oh, think nothing of it. Making a guest feel<br/>welcome is what a good host does.')
('Paulette', "You would do the same in your home, too,<br/>wouldn't you?")
('Feri', 'O-Of course.')
('Victor', 'Kids your age gotta eat a lot to grow up big<br/>and strong.')
('Victor', 'Keep an eye on them both, all right, Van?')
('Van', "Will do. And thanks for comin' to see us off, Yumes.")
('Yumé', 'Heehee. Have a safe trip...!')
(500, 'Several days later...')
(500, 'September 12th, 1208, 4:00PM')
('Agnès', 'Neither of them have reacted since that day.')
('Van', "There's obviously some kinda trigger, but I just can't<br/>put my finger on what.")
('Van', "One thing's clear, though: that red Genesis caused all<br/>those jaegers to turn into ghouls.")
('Van', 'You said they were designed for researching<br/>biological activity, yeah?')
('Agnès', "Yes. That's what was written in the diaries, anyway.")
('Agnès', 'Supposedly, they were used in the development of<br/>recovery arts like Tear.')
('Van', 'Maybe they somehow turned that ability on its head<br/>in this case.')
('Van', "Either way, we can't take these things lightly.")
('Agnès', 'Agreed...')
('Agnès', 'I never imagined they would be abused like this...and<br/>by the mafia of all people.')
('Agnès', 'All the Geneses did was bring pain and suffering to<br/>Feri and Aida...')
('Van', "I mean, that's not completely true—the one you held<br/>on to pretty much saved our asses.")
('Van', "It's the thing that suppressed the red Genesis. If that<br/>didn't happen, we would've been royally screwed.")
('Van', "And with two Geneses in our hands, that's two less<br/>for any evil bastards who wanna get thier greasy<br/>hands on 'em.")
('Van', "Now's not the time to throw in the towel. The fight<br/>hasn't even begun.")
('Agnès', "Oh, I know. I don't intend to stop here—doing that<br/>would be a betrayal to the people who have suffered<br/>and died because of the Geneses.")
('Agnès', "They're incredibly dangerous—no doubt about that.<br/>But that's precisely why I can't turn a blind eye<br/>to this.")
('Agnès', "I hope the feeling is mutual—I'll still need your help,<br/>after all.")
('Van', "And you'll have it. I already told you I'd pitch in<br/>however I can.")
('Van', "But you don't have to pitch in here to get my help.<br/>You sure you wanna keep workin' for someone<br/>like me?")
('Van', "You know full well I'm not like the cops or bracers.<br/>I do things my own way.")
('Van', "And that way isn't black, but it definitely ain't<br/>white, either. Mine's like the color of a dark blue sky<br/>just before dawn.")
('Van', "I don't want you to get stained from bein' too close—")
('Agnès', "Don't worry. That will never happen.")
('Agnès', "The act you performed for Aida just isn't in<br/>my nature.")
('Agnès', 'And I could not have stood in for Feri in the way that<br/>you did.')
('Agnès', "I'm not going to become a wholly different person if I<br/>stay by your side.")
('Agnès', "I'm very much my own woman, and that's not about<br/>to change.")
('Agnès', "I'm planning to stay right where I am, and I don't<br/>intend to leave anytime soon.")
('Van', '...')
('Van', "Damn. You're still rarin' for more even after all<br/>that's happened? You're either fearless or the chillest<br/>person I've ever met.")
('Van', "There's some trouble stirrin', that much is for sure.<br/>I don't just mean Almata.")
('Van', "The Direwolf belongs to a pack of absolute wackos,<br/>and they're arguably more dangerous than the mafia.")
('Agnès', "Right... I think I heard the name of their group.<br/>Wasn't it the society?")
('Van', "Yeah. I'll tell you about 'em when the time's right.")
('Van', "It feels like the CID's cooking up somethin'<br/>fishy, too.")
('Van', "And while our interests sometimes align with the<br/>guild's, we're still not exactly buddy-buddy.")
('Van', '*sigh* The more I think about it, the more I realize<br/>we could use a few more allies.')
('Agnès', 'Or at least another pair of hands...')
('Feri', 'Another pair of hands coming right up!')
('Feri', 'Oh, maybe I should knock before I shout.')
('Van', 'Hold up...')
('Agnès', 'Feri?!')
('Feri', "Heehee. Nice to see you guys, even if it hasn't been<br/>super long. Thanks a bunch for all the help you<br/>gave me.")
('Feri', "I know I should've given you, like, a billion<br/>thank-yous after everything you did. Sorry...")
('Agnès', "Oh, there's no need to apologize—nor is there any<br/>need to shower us in thanks.")
('Van', "Yeah. I got showered in mira, so I'm good.")
('Van', "You went back to your village after we split, right?<br/>Then I'm guessin' you came here with your dad<br/>this time.")
('Feri', 'Well, uh, n-not exactly...')
('Feri', 'He kinda sorta maybe...disowned me.')
('Van', 'What.')
('Agnès', 'WHAT?!')
('Feri', 'Well, I did disobey a direct order from the corps,<br/>which is a big no-no.')
('Feri', "I'm also a little too weak for their tastes.")
('Feri', 'Abi told me to go on a journey. He wants me to see<br/>more of the world and expand my horizons and stuff.')
('Feri', 'And that brought me right back to your doorstep.<br/>I owe you guys big time.')
('Feri', "You granted Aida's final wish and taught me an<br/>invaluable lesson—one I intend to carry with me for<br/>the rest of my life.")
('Feri', 'And we Warriors of Kruga always pay our debts...')
('Feri', "...so let me help you out with your work! I can do lots<br/>of things, so please hire me! You won't regret it,<br/>I promise!")
('Agnès', 'Consider yourself hired! Welcome to the Arkride<br/>Solutions team!')
('Van', "H-Hey! That's MY call, part-timer! You're not in<br/>charge of hiring!")
('Feri', 'Oh, I almost forgot! Abi asked me to give you<br/>this, Van.')
('Van', "A letter? Oh, no. I'm gettin' bad vibes already...")
('Van', "(Guessin' he wants me to look out for his<br/>darling daughter. Maybe he'll ask me to talk some<br/>sense into her or somethin'.)")
('System', 'Dear Van Arkride,')
('System', "Thank you in advance for indulging my daughter's<br/>selfish request.")
('System', 'This was not the first time you aided one of our<br/>own—and once again, I was thoroughly impressed by<br/>your combat prowess.')
('System', 'Though I do not appreciate that you robbed my<br/>daughter of an opportunity to grow. I would be lying<br/>if I said I was not beside myself with anger.')
('System', 'If you wish to make amends, you must rectify that<br/>loss by personally nurturing her development.<br/>You may be as harsh a taskmaster as you must.')
('System', 'However, should you dare to make any untoward<br/>advances on her...you will either face death at the<br/>hands of our entire corps...')
('System', '...or be forced to take responsibility for your actions<br/>for the rest of your days.')
('System', 'Regards, Hasan Al-Fayed')
('Agnès', "Are you all right, Van? You're looking rather pale...")
('Feri', 'Umm... So what does it say?')

('Agnès', 'Vaaan! Are you in there?')
('Feri', "The floor's so chilly!")
('Van', "You've gotta be kidding me.")
('Agnès', 'Oh! You really are here.')
('Van', "The hell are you bargin' in on me for?")
('Agnès', 'They told us at Montmart that you might be here<br/>right now.')
('Feri', 'So we decided to join you for a soak.')
('Agnès', 'Speaking of, we should try the löyly!')
('Feri', 'Is that a kind of bath? I only know hamams.')
('Agnès', "It is. I don't know all the specifics, but I think the<br/>temperature control is different.")
('Feri', "Oooh! Let's go find it!")
('Van', "What's a man gotta do to enjoy his bath time in<br/>peace...?")
('Van', "Agh. You know what? I'm going for a second soak<br/>later, AND I'm treatin' myself to some gelato after!")
('Van', 'Mmm!')
('Feri', "It's so cold and sweet!")
('Agnès', 'The perfect treat after a hot bath.')
('Van', 'Exactly. Cold, sweet, and humble as can be.')
('Agnès', 'What do you mean?')
('Van', "It's not trying to be somethin' it's not. It's got no frills<br/>or gimmicks.")
('Van', 'Milk gelato relies on nailing the basics: flavor, texture,<br/>and temperature.')
('Van', "But that's exactly why it's the perfect pairing!")
('Van', 'Simple yet profound. Just like a hot bath.')
('Van', "It's pure relaxation condensed down into<br/>dessert form. Like a cool breeze on a hot<br/>summer's day.")
('Van', "It's moments like this that remind us why life's<br/>worth livin'.")
('Feri', 'I get it! ...Probably!')
('Agnès', '(Knowing Van, I doubt he was kidding around<br/>at all...)')
('Van', "So, why'd you come looking for me before<br/>lunch, anyway? Thought I said we'd meet up in<br/>the afternoon.")
('Agnès', "Well, since Feri's still so new to the city, I wanted to<br/>help her get acclimated.")
('Agnès', "We've been enjoying our morning off<br/>sightseeing together.")
('Feri', "You don't have to go out of your way for me. This is<br/>part of my training.")
('Van', 'Got the lay of the land yet?')
('Feri', "Umm... Let's see... The temple's in the 6th District—<br/>the, uhh...water one.")
('Agnès', "You'll be attending Sunday School there, right?")
('Feri', "Yeah. I stopped in to say hello, but it's the only other<br/>district I've been to.")
('Feri', "This city is so huge. I have no idea how we'd plan for<br/>urban warfare here.")
('Agnès', 'Is that really an issue...?')

('Feri', 'Right...')
('Van', "Don't worry. I'll show you the ropes.")
('Agnès', "What's on our itinerary?")
('Van', "We can't see the whole city in a day, but we can still<br/>make a dent while we handle some jobs.")
('Van', "And since Feri's a combat vet, she oughta catch on<br/>mighty quick.")
('Van', "Don't go fallin' behind, now.")
('Feri', 'Roger that!')

('Feri', "Is this one of the guild's message boards?")
('Agnès', "Actually, it's this district's public bulletin board.")
('Agnès', "As you can see, it's mostly used for announcements<br/>or advertising.")
('Van', 'If you wanna find the stuff addressed to us, all you<br/>gotta do is reach around back.')
('Van', "Now and then, folks'll reach out and contact me<br/>directly, but most of our jobs come from boards<br/>like this.")
('Feri', 'Huh. I thought our jobs would involve more fighting.')
('Feri', 'I was expecting like, assassinations and stuff.')
('Agnès', "Ahaha... People don't come to us with matters<br/>THAT violent...do they?")
('Van', "Nah. Every once in a while, I've gotta beat up a<br/>stalker or something, but that's about it.")

('Agnès', 'Supposedly, once you receive a calling card from her,<br/>your fate is sealed.')
('Feri', 'Wow... There are so many interesting people in<br/>the city.')
('Agnès', 'Because Grimcat never steals from the innocent,<br/>many people in Edith admire her.')
('Van', "They also say she scampers around the city in a<br/>skimpy outfit you'd expect to see in a seedy club.")

('Feri', "I'm not surprised about Van since he seems to<br/>know everybody...")
('Feri', "...but I wouldn't think an assassin and an A-rank<br/>bracer would get along.")
('Van', 'Yin and I bumped into each other on a job two<br/>years back.')
('Van', "As for Elaine, dunno. Guess they must've teamed up<br/>at some point.")
('Van', "Shame I couldn't just sit back while they handled<br/>everything this time.")
('Halle', "Is there anybody you don't know?")
('Jack', "Heh. You talk tough, but we all know—Cao<br/>included—that you can't help but get involved.")
('Van', 'Can it, already.')
('Van', "Though, can't say I enjoy feelin' like he had us<br/>dancin' in the palm of his hand.")
('Jack', 'I suspect this whole thing was probably just a<br/>changing of the guard over at Heiyue, so to speak.')
('Jack', 'Fan went to mourn the dead and visit their families.')
('Jack', 'Even sent the bodies of the thugs back home—well,<br/>those with enough of a body left to send.')
('Jack', "It's all made him pretty popular around here.")
('Halle', "No doubt thanks to Cao's schemes.")
('Halle', "He's already done so much over in Crossbell and<br/>Erebonia, and now he's masterminded all this, too.")
('Halle', 'People are starting to talk about him being a<br/>future elder.')
('Van', "Bah! That freakin' guy...")
('Ashen', "I knooow, isn't he dreamy? ❤")
('Halle', 'Oh, right. Did you make it back in time for<br/>school, Agnès?')
('Agnès', 'Ahaha... Not quite.')
('Van', "How many times did I warn you about missin' the<br/>night train?")
('Feri', "You sound like you're her dad or something.")
('Ashen', 'Not like it would have been easy to leave anyway.<br/>Between the guild, police, and navy, it was a<br/>real mess.')
('Agnès', 'Van ended up giving us a ride back in the early hours<br/>of the morning...')
('Agnès', '...so at least I was still able to attend my<br/>afternoon classes.')
('Ashen', "If I were you, I'd have called it a wash and taken the<br/>rest of the day off.")
('Feri', "That's our model student for you.")
('Halle', 'Are you glad you got to see things through to<br/>the end?')
('Agnès', "Yes. Though, I don't feel like I was able to contribute<br/>that much.")
('Agnès', "Even so, I'm glad that I was there to provide what<br/>help I could.")
('Van', 'Heh...')
('Jack', 'Are you a lucky boss or what?')
('Jack', "Can't imagine Elaine's all that pleased about<br/>it, though.")
('Van', "Don't remind me. Already got an earful about it<br/>last night.")
('Van', 'So, you given her suggestion any thought?')
('Agnès', '...I think Elaine would do her best to solve my case.<br/>I can trust her.')
('Agnès', "However, I've seen firsthand that some problems can<br/>only be solved by eschewing conventions. I think<br/>there's still more to learn this way.")
('Agnès', 'So...I stand by my initial decision.')
('Van', 'If you say so.')
('Feri', 'Heehee.')
('Halle', 'Keep at it!')
('Ashen', "What she said. You've got this!")
('Agnès', 'Will do!')
('Ashen', 'Hmm. Now the only problem left is Aaron.')
('Ashen', "He's more into older women, so I don't think he'll<br/>cause too much grief, but he's still a bad influence...")
('Agnès', 'You think so?')
('Feri', 'Is he really that bad?')
('Van', "...Hold on. What are we talkin' about right now?")
('Van', 'That salve had him knocked out cold by the time<br/>we left.')
('Van', "He's not gonna be up and around for a few weeks<br/>now, right?")
('Ashen', 'About that—')
('Aaron', 'Leave it to an old fart to think like an old fart.')
('Van', '...')
('Agnès', 'Welcome to Edith!')
('Feri', 'Did you find the place all right?')
('Aaron', 'It was my first time taking the subway, but it was<br/>actually pretty easy.')
('Aaron', "But damn if this city isn't hella big.")
('Ashen', 'Wow! You made good time.')
('Halle', 'I was surprised you made up your mind so quickly.')
('Aaron', "Once I did my mourning with Fan and said my<br/>goodbyes, that's all there was to do.")
('Aaron', 'Oh, by the way, the folks downstairs are letting me<br/>rent a room here.')
('Van', 'What?! Why are you even here?!')
('Aaron', "Thanks to your investigation, I don't have a place to<br/>belong anymore.")
('Aaron', 'But really, this is a chance to take a hard look<br/>at myself.')
('Aaron', "So I told anyone who'd care that I'd be skipping town<br/>for a while.")
('Aaron', 'And since I have nowhere else to be, you get the<br/>honor of hanging with me for a while.')
('Aaron', "I'll crash here, work for you during the day, and see<br/>the sights of the capital at night.")
('Aaron', "Oh, and count on me for whatever Almata and<br/>Genesis stuff you've got going on.")
('Feri', 'I look forward to fighting alongside you again!')
('Agnès', "We're pleased to have you.")
('Van', "Ain't you all forgetting who's in charge here?!")
('Van', 'Those scheming Heiyue bastards... Pick up your<br/>damn phones, already!')
('Aaron', "Careful. You're gonna sprout some gray hairs at<br/>this rate.")
('Jack', "I think it's time to fold, pal.")
('Halle', "I'm sure it'll be fine.")
('Ashen', 'Aaron, remember to be a courteous guest, all right?')
('Aaron', 'Yeah, yeah.')
('Aaron', "Just take care of Langport while I'm away, will ya?")
('System', 'Main 4SPG [Business Trip to Langport] completed!<br/>Received')
('System', 'Main 4SPG [Helping Aaron] completed!<br/>Received')
('Aaron', 'So, you wanna go out for a drink or two<br/>tonight, Paulette?')
('Paulette', "Heehee. You really shouldn't tease your<br/>elders, Aaron.")
('Yumé', 'Hey! You leave Mommy alone!')
('Van', "This brat's somethin' else...")
('Feri', "*munch* I kinda feel like she's just brushing him<br/>off, though.")
('Agnès', 'Ahaha...')
('Agnès', "So, we're going to be splitting up this afternoon?")
('Van', "Yeah, 'cause we've got more people now.")
('Van', "I'm obviously gonna be one of the ones workin'<br/>outside, but I'm gonna have one of you come with<br/>me, too.")
('Van', "The remaining two will either be standing by here in<br/>the office, or out gatherin' info and looking into<br/>things separately.")
('Aaron', 'And then if we get a job that needs more<br/>manpower—like, say, a monster extermination gig—<br/>we regroup for it?')
('Aaron', "Sounds good. I don't wanna go around all<br/>buddy-buddy with everyone all the time, either.")
('Feri', "That's not a very nice thing to say... Though that does<br/>sound pretty efficient to me, too.")
('Van', "We don't have any subcontracted work right now, but<br/>that could change any second.")
('Van', "Either way, the main team's focus is gonna be<br/>patrolling districts where it feels like something might<br/>happen while watchin' the 4SPGs.")
('Agnès', "'Where something might happen'? Can you really<br/>tell that?")
('Aaron', 'Makes sense to me.')
('Aaron', "After you've lived in a place long enough to know it<br/>like your own backyard, you just know when<br/>something smells off.")
('Feri', 'Really? Hmm...')
('Van', "There's always stuff you're gonna miss if you don't go<br/>lookin' around, so that's what we're gonna do.")
('Van', "Life's full of surprises, especially in a field like this.")
('Agnès', "So that's why we need to split up and be flexible?")
('Agnès', "I'll have to work very hard not to be the one holding<br/>the whole team back!")
('Van', "There's no need to think that hard about it.<br/>Other than the fact we're splittin' up, everything else<br/>is gonna be the same as it always was.")
('Van', "Anyway, looks like it's noon already.")
('Feri', "Then let's get to work!")
('Aaron', "Now it's my turn to see what you guys can do.")
('System', 'Select one additional member to accompany Van.<br/>They can be swapped out later.')
('Van', '(Should we head over to the park now?)')
('Van', "(We'd best take care of everything that needs doing<br/>here before we go.)")
('System', 'After you set off for the memorial park, the main<br/>story will advance.')
('System', 'Van contacted the backup members and explained<br/>the situation.')
('System', 'Before long, everyone was gathered in front of the<br/>garage and ready to go.')
('Feri', 'So the memorial park is a place people from the<br/>capital go to relax?')
('Agnès', "That's right. Whole families sometimes go there for<br/>picnics, for example.")
('Agnès', "It's also popular for couples going on dates, since it's<br/>split into multiple areas, each with their own<br/>natural charms.")
('Feri', 'That sounds like a perfect place to do some<br/>combat drills!')
('Aaron', 'Small fry here never changes...')
('Van', "It's within walkin' distance if you really want to go<br/>that way, but most people just head there by car or<br/>by bus.")
('Van', "It's about thirty minutes from here in the car.")
('Aaron', "Tch. Kind of a trek, but I guess we've got no choice.")
('Aaron', "Let's see what this pickup of yours is like to ride.")
('Agnès', "Oh, that's right. This will be your first time in<br/>Van's car.")
('Van', 'You better not get her dirty, punkass.')
('Aaron', 'Little late for that. Poor thing probably stinks of old<br/>man musk after years of carrying you around.')
('Van', "Hahaha! I'm gonna murder you someday, you<br/>little shit.")
('Agnès', 'Oh! Excuse me...<br/>(Wait. This number belongs to...)')
('Agnès', "Hello? Yes, I'm glad you called, actually.")
('Agnès', "I'm afraid I might be back a little late today, you see...")
('Agnès', 'What? From my family?!')
('Agnès', "But I'm about to...")
('Renne', "Well, I'm not going to force you to come back. It's all<br/>up to you.")
('Agnès', "...Message received. I'm on my way.")
('Agnès', 'Yes. Of course. Goodbye for now, then.')
('Agnès', "I'm so sorry. Something important's come up that I<br/>really need to take care of.")
('Van', "Don't sweat it. Go do whatever you gotta do.")
('Van', 'The rest of us can handle a few stray critters.')
('Agnès', "I'm sure you can, but...please, be careful.")
('Agnès', "Again, my apologies. I'll make my way back to the<br/>office as soon as I'm done!")
('Aaron', 'Huh.')
('Feri', "Wh-What was all that about? Agnès doesn't usually<br/>lose her composure like that.")
('Van', "Just let her do her thing. We'll get our job done and<br/>be back here by this evening.")
('System', 'On their way back, they stopped to purchase some<br/>coffee beans from a roastery near the market in the<br/>9th District...')
('System', '...and by the time they returned to Old Town, the<br/>rain was coming down even more heavily.')
('Van', 'Huh.')
('Feri', "It looks like she's finished whatever she needed to<br/>deal with.")
('Aaron', "Can't believe she actually waited here.<br/>Starch-straight laces, I swear.")
('Agnès', 'Welcome back, everyone. How did things go at<br/>the park?')
('Feri', 'Oh, it was no problem at all.')
('Van', 'Something up? You look oddly tired.')
('Agnès', "I-I do? I can't imagine why...")
('Agnès', "I really can't apologize enough for walking off like<br/>that during work hours, though. I—")
('Albert', "So you're the spriggan, are you?")
('Van', '...?')
('Feri', 'Umm...')
('Aaron', "Who's this runt?")
('Agnès', 'Wh-What are you doing here, Albert?')
('Van', 'Ahh. This a classmate of yours? Shoulda put two and<br/>two together when I saw the uniform.')
('Aaron', '*whistle* He your boyfriend or something?')
('Feri', 'Wait! Is he?!')
('Agnès', "N-No! He's just a classmate I've known for a long—")
('Albert', "I'll just come out and say it... Take your poisonous<br/>fangs out of my friend!")
('Van', '...')
('Van', '...Huh?')
('Agnès', 'A-A-Albert?! What are you saying?!')
('Albert', "I've heard a LOT of unpleasant rumors about you.")
('Albert', 'They call you a good-for-nothing who takes on all<br/>manner of borderline-criminal requests.')
('Albert', "You're just taking advantage of her kind nature to<br/>force her to do your dirty work, aren't you?!")
('Agnès', "N-Now hold on! You've got Van all wrong—")
('Albert', "Sorry, but stay out of this, Agnès! Well? Aren't you<br/>going to deny it? You can't, can you?!")
('Van', 'Slow your roll, there, kiddo.')
('Van', '...This is about when she got back real late a while<br/>ago, right?')
('Van', "Guess that's what made you start worryin' about<br/>her, huh? Especially now that she's gettin' calls<br/>from home.")
('Albert', 'H-How do you...?')
('Aaron', 'Anyone can connect the dots when the clues are<br/>this obvious. How naïve can you get?')
('Feri', 'He seems like a nice guy to me.')
('Albert', "Wh-What's wrong with being concerned about<br/>your friends?!")
('Albert', 'This all started because YOU casually decided to hire<br/>her without thinking of the consequences!')
('Albert', 'If word was to get out that Agnès is working with<br/>seedy people like you, it would put her father in a<br/>very—')
('Agnès', 'ALBERT!')
('Albert', "...I'm sorry. I said too much. But I still—")
('Aaron', '(...O-ho?)')
('Feri', '(...Who is her dad?)')
('Van', '(...)')
('Odette', "There you are! I knew we'd find you here.")
('Odette', 'You really need to stop charging in like a bull in a<br/>glass shop, Albert!')
('Renne', 'Heehee. He never changes.')
('Van', '...')
('Agnès', 'O-Odette! Renne!')
('Feri', "Oh! More of Agnès' friends!")
('Aaron', 'For real? What is this, a field trip?')
('Albert', 'What are you two doing here?')
('Odette', "We're here to tell you off, duh. I thought I already<br/>told you that you need to let Agnès live her own life.")
('Odette', 'You have serious tunnel vision when it comes to her,<br/>and you need to do something about it.')
('Albert', "N-No, I don't...! I just...")
('Odette', "Oh, right! I'm Odette, by the way! Nice to finally<br/>meet you all.")
('Odette', "I've heard a lot about you guys from Agnès!")
('Odette', 'Ooh, you must be Feri! Oh. My. Goodness, you really<br/>are SO ADORABLE!')
('Odette', "And wow! I knew you were hot, Aaron, but the sun's<br/>got nothing on you!")
('Odette', 'And...well, yeah, Van, you got some mega bad boy<br/>vibes—which trust me, only makes you look cooler.')
('Odette', "You're a lot younger than I was expecting, by the way.<br/>I thought you'd be way older. No offense!")
('Van', 'Thanks, I...think...?')
('Agnès', "O-Odette, please! You're being very rude!")
('Feri', 'Ahaha...')
('Aaron', 'Damn. No off button on this girl, huh?')
('Renne', "Heehee. Don't mind our resident ball of energy<br/>over here.")
('Renne', "We're all members of Aramis Academy's<br/>Student Council.")
('Renne', 'Agnès is in charge of general affairs.')
('Renne', 'I apologize our treasurer got a little...hmm...<br/>ahead of himself.')
('Van', "Nah, it's fine. Can't blame the kid for bein' worried.")
('Van', "But her wants have come first and foremost so far,<br/>and I plan on keepin' it that way.")
('Albert', 'Hrgh...')
('Agnès', 'Van...')
('Odette', 'Sounds like a good deal to me.')
('Renne', 'Well, all I ask as Student Council president and her<br/>dorm neighbor...')
('Renne', '...is that you do your best to keep her safe.')
('Renne', "Now, let's get going, Albert. Agnès clearly still has<br/>some work to do.")
('Renne', 'We should leave her to it.')
('Albert', "W-Wait! I-I'm not finished—")
('Renne', "Really? Very well. As long as you've finished the<br/>budget I asked you to handle, you can stay.")
('Renne', 'You DID finish that before coming out here, correct?')
('Albert', 'Umm... Well...')
('Renne', "*sigh* Meanwhile, Agnès handled every one of those<br/>tedious purchase requests I made before coming to<br/>her quote-unquote 'actual' job.")
('Renne', "If you want to fault others for how they handle their<br/>affairs, you'd best have your own in order first.")
('Albert', 'Agh...')
('Renne', "Well, good day to you, Mister Spriggan. I'll see you<br/>back at the dorms, Agnès.")
('Odette', "See you tomorrow, Agnès! Don't come home<br/>TOO late!")
('Agnès', 'Th-Thank you. Have a safe trip back, everyone!')
('Aaron', "(Who the hell's the one with the purple hair?)")
('Feri', "(I'm wondering the same thing. She's not the kind of<br/>student you see here every day.)")
('Van', "(Hard to believe it's been five years...)")
('Van', "(She sure ain't the lost kitten she was back<br/>then anymore. She's really grown up.)")
('Aaron', 'So what WAS that all about?')
('Aaron', 'You know, the call from home that was so important<br/>you ditched us in the middle of a job.')
('Agnès', '...')
('Feri', "Hey, don't be mean! It's not like we weren't perfectly<br/>capable of handling stuff.")
('Aaron', "Course we were. But that's not the point.")
('Aaron', "It's fine to have shit come up from time to time—but<br/>not for other people you know to get all up in our<br/>business about it.")
('Aaron', "You might be doing what you think is best, but you<br/>should ask yourself if you're doing right by everyone<br/>around you. All I'm saying.")
('Agnès', 'Umm... Well...')
('Feri', '...')
('Aaron', "This stuff's important whether you're Heiyue, a<br/>jaeger, or just some Joe working a desk job.")
('Aaron', "And it's crazy to me that I'M the one pushing this<br/>and not you.")
('Van', "Yeah, I guess you're right.")
('Van', "Your old man startin' to have a problem with your<br/>side gig?")
('Agnès', 'H-How do you...?')
('Van', "I dunno squat. I'm just guessin'.")
('Agnès', '...')
('Van', "I haven't changed my stance since you started<br/>workin' here.")
('Van', 'You make the calls on what you wanna do with<br/>your life. Whether that leads you to stick around or<br/>leave is up to you.')
('Van', "Though if your family's gonna start interfering, I<br/>might have to be careful what I ask you to do from<br/>here on out.")
('Feri', 'Van...')
('Agnès', "It's the opposite of what you all seem to think.<br/>He was only checking in on me.")
('Agnès', "My father is a busy man. He doesn't even have time<br/>to send the occasional letter, like Feri's does.")
('Agnès', "I haven't spoken to him in three months, so I didn't<br/>want to pass up the chance. I really am sorry about<br/>running off.")
('Feri', "So that's what it was...")
('Aaron', 'Heh.')
('Agnès', 'Honestly, I thought I was going to get yelled at for<br/>being late the other day, or taking on this<br/>dangerous job...')
('Agnès', "But even though I'm sure he knows everything I've<br/>been doing, he didn't have a word of criticism<br/>about it.")
('Agnès', "...In short, it's not going to be a problem for me to<br/>keep working as I've been doing.")
('Agnès', 'This should be the last time I have to run off like<br/>that, too.')
('Feri', 'Agnès...')
('Aaron', '...Hmph.')
('Van', "Well, it ain't up to me to poke my nose into other<br/>people's family business.")
('Van', "But it sounds to me like he trusts you, and that's<br/>worth something.")
('Van', "It's up to you what you want do with the Geneses, or<br/>whether you want this job to begin with. Am<br/>I wrong?")
('Agnès', "...No, you're absolutely right.")
('Agnès', "Either way, I'm happy to be able to keep working<br/>with you all.")
('Feri', "Yeah! We're happy to have you, too!")
('Aaron', 'Try not to fall behind, though.')
('Van', "She's been doin' this longer than you have...but I'm<br/>with Feri on this one.")
('Van', "Just...try and do somethin' about that friend of yours.<br/>We can't have him bargin' in half the damn time in<br/>the future.")
('Agnès', "I'll do my best to clear up his misunderstandings—or,<br/>barring that, at least get him to promise to leave<br/>us alone.")
('Aaron', "Yeah, you tell him the truth and he'd lose his shit.")
('Feri', 'Hmm... So this is an example of the ends justifying<br/>the means, huh? Now I get it!')
('Agnès', 'I mean, it...is, but try not to learn any life<br/>lessons from it...')
('Van', 'Wait. This is—')
('Dingo', 'You got a moment, Van?')
('Van', 'Hey. Not often I get a call from you.')
('Van', "You got work or somethin'? We just wrapped a job<br/>up, so we're free if you wanna talk it out.")
('Dingo', "Perfect. But I'm not the one with the request.")
('Dingo', 'I was asked by an acquaintance to hook them up with<br/>some facetime with you.')
('Dingo', 'I gave them your work number, so they should be<br/>calling anytime now. Up to you whether you take<br/>them on, though.')
('Van', '...Oh? Well, all right. Got it.')
('Aaron', 'Sounds like it was that tabloid geek?')
('Aaron', "Guy has nothing on me, but he's got the looks.<br/>Unlike a certain crusty old fart I know.")
('Van', 'You wanna take this outside, brat?')
('Feri', "(I think Van's pretty good looking, though...)")
('Agnès', "(Heehee. I think he'd cry with joy if he heard you<br/>say that.)")
('Van', 'Huh. There it is already.')
('Nina', "Oh! Thank goodness! I was worried I wouldn't be<br/>able to get through.")
('Feri', 'No way...')
('Aaron', 'For real?!')
('Agnès', "I-Isn't that...?")
('Van', "Okay, when Dingo told me he had a client, I never<br/>dreamed it'd be you.")
('Nina', 'Heehee. I see a new face among your number, too.')
('Nina', "In any case, I'm very much hoping to work with you.")
('Van', 'All right. See you at 7PM tomorrow.')
('Agnès', "Of course. I'll make sure to tell everyone that I'm<br/>going somewhere this time, too.")
('Agnès', 'Well, good night, everyone.')
('Van', "So, I figure Feri's comin', but what about you?")
('Aaron', "I'm down. Like I could say no after hearing all that.")
('Feri', "I'm totally coming, too!")
('Van', "*sigh* Not that I can blame you. That story would've<br/>gotten anyone's interest.")
('Van', "Guess that means we're all goin' to Tharbad.")
('Feri', 'A film festival?')
('Van', "One's held every year in the city of Messeldam, to<br/>the north.")
('Van', "Though I'd heard this year's was canceled about two<br/>months back, thanks to a terrorist threat.")
('Nina', 'The one in Messeldam certainly was, but this is<br/>something else.')
('Nina', "It's a new event taking place for the first time this<br/>year, backed by the Principality of Elsaim in the<br/>Central East.")
('Nina', "It's going to be called the Tharbad Film Festival, and<br/>it's sponsored by Vegas Films.")
('Van', 'Oh, right. I remember hearing about that, now that<br/>you mention it.')
('Aaron', "Vegas is a film distributor that's had a bunch of big<br/>hits lately, right?")
('Aaron', 'All directed by some freak named Gotti.')
('Feri', 'O-Oh! Golden Blood was one of those, right?')
('Agnès', "That's right. They're still a relatively new company,<br/>but at their current rate, they'll be a major studio<br/>before much longer.")
('Agnès', 'The director prioritizes entertainment value above all<br/>else, and his films can be a bit, erm...extreme in<br/>their content.')
('Aaron', "Pfft. You want extreme, try watching the<br/>director's cut. Now THAT was spicy.")
('Agnès', "I-I can't! I'm still sixteen!")
('Feri', "What's a 'director's cut?'")
('Van', "Vegas Films wouldn't be where they are without<br/>Salvatore Gotti. No one makes cinema the way<br/>he does.")
('Van', "So I'm guessin' the whole thing's mostly an excuse to<br/>give his company and their releases most of<br/>the awards?")
('Nina', 'Not at all. Gotti is determined to make the judging<br/>process completely fair and impartial.')
('Nina', 'Most of the nominated films are mass-market, but a<br/>wide variety of directors, actors, and actresses<br/>are invited.')
('Nina', 'I am one of those actresses, as is the other client for<br/>this request.')
('Agnès', 'I see...')
('Van', "And so that's the context behind this threatening<br/>letter that showed up at your agency?")
('Nina', "Indeed... It reads like this: 'Decline to participate in<br/>the Tharbad Film Festival, or tragedy will befall you.'")
('Nina', 'The same letter was sent to other companies<br/>connected to ours, too.')
('Nina', "We can't rule out the possibility that it's just an<br/>elaborate prank, but we're still concerned.")
('Feri', "You definitely can't ignore it when another film<br/>festival's already been canceled because of a<br/>terrorist threat...")
('Aaron', "Though the culprit could've just sent these things<br/>because they knew you'd feel that way.")
('Nina', 'Yes. My agency has been trying to persuade me not to<br/>attend because of the danger involved...')
('Nina', "...but I'm still a relatively inexperienced actress, so I<br/>think the festival could be a valuable opportunity.")
('Nina', 'The other client for this job feels the same way, and<br/>that was what inspired us to look for potential help.')
('Van', "And that's when you chanced on us, huh?")
('Aaron', "Heh. You're a lot gutsier than you look.")
('Nina', "Heehee. When I met you all earlier today, it<br/>reminded me of some rumors I'd heard about you in<br/>the industry.")
('Nina', 'And since I already knew Dingo from when he<br/>previously helped with some trouble in my agency, I<br/>asked him for your number.')
('Nina', 'Your team just seems like the most reasonable option.')
('Nina', "In this line of work, image is everything, so I really<br/>don't want to get the police involved and turn this<br/>into a big deal...")
('Nina', "...but the guild isn't really suited to delicate matters<br/>like these, either.")
('Agnès', 'That makes sense. Bracers have always struck me as<br/>prioritizing their code above all else and avoiding<br/>anything remotely illegal.')
('Van', "Yeah. Bracers are heroes of justice first and<br/>foremost—if you need moral flexibility, they ain't<br/>your guys.")
('Van', "Dingo's brought me showbiz-related jobs in the past,<br/>so this wouldn't be my first time doin' one...")
('Van', "Will be my first time with one this big, though.<br/>Hope you know this ain't gonna come cheap.")
('Nina', "Of course. You'd be protecting the film festival—<br/>that's quite a task.")
('Van', 'Hmm...')
('Nina', "If you are willing to do this, I'd like you to plan to<br/>arrive in Tharbad the day after tomorrow.")
('Nina', "I'd then like you to nose around for any suspicious<br/>activity during the three days leading up to<br/>the festival.")
('Nina', "However you do that is up to you, of course.<br/>I'm aware you traditionally handle requests through<br/>that '4SPG' system of yours.")
('Nina', 'Myself and the other client will provide for your<br/>expenses and compensation out of our personal<br/>funds, too.')
('Feri', 'Wow... You can afford that?')
('Aaron', "Makes sense a rising star would be filthy rich.<br/>Now you've got me curious about who this 'other<br/>client' is.")
('Van', 'Hmm...<br/>(Yeah, this is gonna be longer than our visit to<br/>Langport, even. What to do...)')
('Agnès', '(*gasp* Van!)')
('Feri', '(Oh!)')
('Aaron', '(Wait...)')
('Nina', '...Hmm? What is it?')
('Van', "Oh, don't sweat it.")
('Van', "Anyway, this is a really big ask outta the blue, so we'll<br/>discuss it and call you back.")
('Van', 'Usually we prefer a bit more of a heads up on tall<br/>orders like this.')
('Van', "Gettin' everything ready on our end to arrive in<br/>Tharbad in time for the day after tomorrow ain't<br/>gonna be easy.")
('Nina', "I'm sorry for imposing on you. It's just that I only<br/>really decided after meeting you in person.")
('Nina', 'Oh, but considering the short notice, maybe I could<br/>offer you a little something extra to sweeten the deal?')
('Nina', "I'd be happy to treat you to a limited-edition<br/>confection available at the Al-Jumeirah, a six-star<br/>hotel in Tharbad.")
('Van', '...Oh? Tell me more. Just for reference.')
('Nina', "It's called melfita, a type of chocolate made using<br/>camel's milk.")
('Nina', 'They combine it with highly valuable cacao pulp, too,<br/>I believe.')
('Nina', 'The result is a unique, full-bodied sweetness that<br/>caresses your tongue—')
('Van', "Okay. I've heard enough.")
('Van', "I'll call you with our decision tomorrow. I suspect it'll<br/>be one that'll make us both happy.")
('Nina', "Heehee. I'll have to thank Dingo for his advice.")
('Nina', "I'll be looking forward to your response, then,<br/>Mr. Arkride.")
('Aaron', 'You are such a damn pushover.')
('Aaron', "But hell, I've never been to Tharbad before, so I'm<br/>kinda looking forward to this.")
('Feri', "Oh! I've been there before, so I might be able to help<br/>us get around a little!")
('Van', "I don't mind you guys comin' along, just make sure<br/>you take care of everything you've gotta do here first.")
('Van', "I'm sure you got a lotta schoolwork to do, Ferida—<br/>and you gotta get your license renewed, right?")
('Feri', "Oh, you're right! If nothing else, I need to get my<br/>math homework done.")
('Aaron', "I know about the license, but man it's a pain. Can't I<br/>just go without one for a few days?")
('Van', 'Like hell, you can!')
('Van', "(I can't believe it lit up right that moment.)")
('Van', '(Was it a coincidence? Nah...like hell it was.)')
('Van', "The city's always got a nice ambience to it when it's<br/>rainin', but something smells a bit off.")
('Van', "This is as good a time as any to go sniffin' around<br/>before we head off to the desert, I guess.")
('Van', '(Should I call it a night?)')
('Van', "(Tomorrow's gonna be another busy day, so I should<br/>probably turn in soon.)")
('System', 'Choosing to finish up for the night will cause all<br/>unfinished quests and subevents to disappear.')
('Van', "Wait, what's this?")
('System', 'Would you care to join me for a tea party<br/>in Riverside?')
('Van', "Man. Always got people runnin' around at her beck<br/>and call.")
('Van', 'Still, who am I to say no to an invitation?')

('Agnès', 'It is quite exciting, though. You never know, we really<br/>might meet lots of famous people.')
('Feri', "You're right. We'll be meeting Nina for sure, and she<br/>had a really unique...aura, I guess!")
('Paulette', "Tharbad's a good eight hours by car, isn't it?")
('Paulette', "That's quite a drive. Make sure you have plenty to eat<br/>while you can.")
('Agnès', 'Thank you, Paulette.')
('Aaron', 'Then time for a drink to liven up—')
('Van', "You absolute dumbass. Don't tell me you forgot why<br/>you renewed your license ALREADY.")
('Victor', "You people couldn't stay serious if your lives<br/>depended on it, could you?")
('Paulette', "Heehee. I don't know what job you've taken on that's<br/>taking you to Tharbad, but please do take care.")
('Van', "All right. Can't say I ain't nervous, but you try takin'<br/>the wheel till we're outta Edith.")
('Van', "Let's see you put those driving chops you showed<br/>riding Red Stars around Langport into practice.")
('Aaron', "Méiwèntí! I got this. Ingert, Red Star—it's all the<br/>same when you're behind the wheel.")
('Aaron', 'I can drive this baby way more smoothly than a<br/>shaky-handed codger like you.')
('Van', '...This is gonna be your first and only warning, kid.')
('Van', "You end up scratchin' her or veering us into a ticket<br/>and you're gonna be in the trunk the rest of the way.")
('Aaron', "...Sweets really aren't the only thing you're picky<br/>about, huh?")
('Feri', 'Like cars and saunas. The essentials of life!')
('Agnès', 'Still, it sounds like as long as you drive safely,<br/>everything will be...fine?')
('Van', 'Ugh... Why does someone have to call now?<br/>(Wait a sec...)')
('Van', "(Bah... I'd rather not take this in front of them, but<br/>guess I ain't got a choice.)")
('Risette', "Hello, Mr. Arkride. I hope I didn't catch you at a bad<br/>time—oh.")
('Agnès', 'Huh...?')
('Aaron', "Damn. Didn't think it'd be from a chick.")
('Feri', '(A weirdly dressed one, too...)')
('Risette', "I see that I did... I'm very sorry. I didn't know you<br/>were with your employees.")
('Van', "Nah, it's cool.")
('Van', "But sorry. If you had somethin' else you wanted to<br/>run through with me, this ain't a good time.")
('Van', "We're gonna be outta town for a while. Can it wait<br/>till I get back?")
('Risette', 'Oh! I see...')
('Van', "Should've given you a call myself, to be honest, but<br/>this was a real last-minute thing.")
('Risette', 'Not at all. What I wanted to discuss is hardly urgent.')
('Risette', 'I simply noticed a number of...irregularities in the last<br/>set of data you sent me.')
('Risette', 'And as your service provider, I cannot help but<br/>be concerned.')
('Risette', 'I am deeply worried on a personal level, too,<br/>considering I am charged with your care.')
('Van', "Uhh... I mean, I'm grateful, but...")
('Van', "Anyway, we'll only be away for a few days. I'll call you<br/>once things settle down afterwards. See ya.")
('Risette', 'Oh, please wai—')
('Van', 'Phew... Uh.')
('Van', "Wh-Why're you all looking at me like that?<br/>She doesn't work at some sleazy shop or<br/>whatever, okay?")
('Aaron', "You sure about that? Sounded like she was talking to<br/>her fa-vo-rite customer from where I'm standing.")
('Van', 'And what the hell gave you that impression?!')
('Feri', "I dunno what this 'sleazy shop' stuff is about, but she<br/>WAS super pretty.")
('Feri', 'Her outfit was really cute, too!')
('Agnès', "It looked like a maid outfit. Which, yes, did make me<br/>wonder what 'service' she 'provides' while being<br/>'charged with your care'...")

('Agnès', 'Oh, not that I think my personal circumstances<br/>should push us into taking this on, of course!')

('Van', "But that goes both ways. You're a student first, so<br/>don't go forcin' your decision to line up with our job.")
('Van', "Even if we do end up in the same general place, your<br/>studies might mean we won't even see each other.")

('Feri', "Heehee. She's such an amazing lady.")
('Agnès', "She really is. I couldn't agree more.")
('Feri', 'By the way, Agnès, did you manage to finish your<br/>report on your visitation to Basel?')
('Agnès', 'I most certainly did!')
('Agnès', 'The others in my group helped a lot, too, and we<br/>ended up receiving some very positive feedback from<br/>the school.')
('Agnès', "Though I'm happy Renne was willing to cover up so<br/>much for me—no, happy isn't what I should be<br/>saying, is it?")
('Aaron', "The old fart's broken moral compass starting to rub<br/>off on you, huh?")
('Agnès', "I-I'm being careful not to go TOO far! I don't want<br/>to end up like Van.")
('Van', 'Hey.')
('Feri', "Heehee... Oh, we're almost done with the<br/>roasted chestnuts.")
('Van', 'Ahh... I look forward to these every year.')
('Van', 'Their fragrance and soft texture really hammer home<br/>that fall is here.')

('Risette', 'My new artificial limbs are a vast improvement over<br/>my previous ones, even.')

('Risette', 'He came along to make sure everything was how it<br/>should be after all the work that was done on me.')
('Risette', '...Though he has something else he wishes to discuss<br/>in addition to that.')
('Quatre', "Hmm... It's a bit cramped, but there's a wired<br/>connection to the orbal network here, at least.")
('Quatre', 'I should be able to work in this environment.')
('Feri', '...What?')
('Van', "Don't tell me...")
('Quatre', "That's right. I'm going to be helping out around here<br/>for a while.")
('Quatre', "I'll admit that Professor Hamilton may have been the<br/>one to recommend it, but the final decision was mine.")
('Quatre', 'All of you remarkably captured my interest during our<br/>time together.')
('Quatre', "Not just because of Agnès' Geneses, but because of<br/>that Grendel and Mare, too.")
('Van', 'Gah...')
('Risette', 'I suppose no one can blame you for that.')
('Quatre', "I'm also concerned on a broader level.")
('Quatre', "Basel doesn't appear to be the only place where<br/>criminals are misusing tech for nefarious purposes.")

('Agnès', "That's, umm...actually a good point.")
('Risette', 'A very good point. While I am well versed in modern<br/>technology, my field is software, not hardware.')

('Paulette', "They're all growing boys and girls, too, so I want to<br/>be sure to give them all the food they need.")
('Quatre', "So let's shift the topic toward the Geneses and<br/>Van's Grendel.")
('Quatre', "Unfortunately, I don't think it'll be possible to learn<br/>anything about the Geneses' nature from<br/>them directly.")
('Quatre', 'They appear to have some kind of protection, akin to<br/>artifacts, keeping their secrets from us.')
('Quatre', "I can't fathom why they only react to Agnès, either.<br/>It does feel as though the mafia knows a fair amount<br/>about them, though.")
('Agnès', "I had a feeling you wouldn't be able to learn anything<br/>from them...")
('Agnès', 'Mind you, Almata is also somewhat in the dark when<br/>it comes to the Geneses.')
('Van', "Yeah. I get the impression they don't know HOW<br/>they're doing what they're doing with 'em—they just<br/>have an idea of WHAT they can do.")
('Van', "They're more like disposable tools to whip out for<br/>whatever they wanna do at any given point.")
('Feri', "It makes me mad that they're using them that way,<br/>but there's no better way of putting it.")
('Feri', "We've taken four back from them so far, and that's<br/>how it's seemed every time.")
('Aaron', "Yeah. Much as it pisses me off, they don't seem to<br/>give a damn about what happens to a Genesis after<br/>they're done with it.")
('Aaron', "Worth noting here that they do seem to be pretty<br/>consistent in how they've used the Geneses, too.")
('Agnès', 'Yes, I agree.')
('Agnès', "They've referred to everything they've done as<br/>an experiment.")
('Risette', "Whether it's manipulating people's vital energies,<br/>interfering with their minds, or installing a human's<br/>personality into a machine...")
('Risette', '...Almata has kept using the Geneses as a trigger for<br/>various kinds of unnatural phenomena.')
('Quatre', "Yeah. I think that's an important fact to bear in mind<br/>if we're going to get to the bottom of this.")
('Quatre', "Fortunately, in all of the cases we've seen, the<br/>phenomenon triggered hasn't reoccurred once it's<br/>been stopped.")
('Quatre', "...But there is one particular phenomenon that<br/>Almata ISN'T behind that's happened again<br/>and again.")
('Feri', 'Oh...')
('Aaron', "Heh. I got'cha.")
('Agnès', "Van's transformation into the Grendel, correct?")
('Quatre', "That's right. The ability to reproduce results for<br/>further study is a crucial factor in science<br/>and engineering.")
('Quatre', "There's a lot that we don't know about the Grendel,<br/>but what we DO know now is that it's comprised of<br/>exceedingly high-density shards.")
('Quatre', "We also know that Van's holo, Mare, appears when<br/>activating it—or rather, a version of her that possesses<br/>free will appears.")
('Van', 'Yeah.')
('Mare', 'Yeah, yeah. Just tell me what you want.')
('Risette', 'Mare, incidentally, is a custom holo developed<br/>at Marduk.')
('Risette', 'Her source code is classified, but she was created<br/>using AI knowledge purchased from<br/>multiple companies.')
('Risette', 'However, it goes without saying that the holo<br/>designed by Marduk does not have free will.')
('Feri', "And that's normal. The holos that the rest of us use<br/>also talk, but you can't have a conversation with them.")
('Aaron', "But when she shows up to help Van transform, she's<br/>clearly got a sense of self.")
('Agnès', "It's theoretically possible she's programmed to only<br/>seem that way on the surface, but I'm inclined<br/>to agree.")
('Van', "Same here. They'd need to program an obscene<br/>number of possible responses to give the illusion of<br/>free will.")
('Van', "She doesn't even have enough space for that much<br/>code, right?")
('Risette', "That's correct. She takes up only marginally more<br/>space on your Xipha than the holos that everyone<br/>else uses.")
('Risette', 'We would need to perform a special test to be<br/>absolutely sure either way...')
('Risette', '...but the Mare that possesses free will seems to be a<br/>lifeform comprised entirely of data.')
('Feri', "I don't think I can even wrap my head around<br/>that idea...")
('Aaron', 'This is sounding real shady all of a sudden.')
('Agnès', "Now, if for argument's sake, we assume that Mare is<br/>an AI app that's achieved free will...")
('Agnès', '...the trigger for that would have to be the<br/>Geneses, no?')
('Quatre', "That's what I was thinking, yeah.")
('Quatre', "Then again...I hate to say this in front of you, Risette,<br/>but I can't say I fully trust anything Marduk says<br/>or does.")
('Risette', "You needn't worry about causing offense.<br/>I understand why you would feel that way.")
('Quatre', 'Thanks. Still, I think that even they have their limits.')
('Quatre', "I can't help but wonder exactly where the material<br/>that formed her source code came from...")
('Quatre', "...but I can't imagine they entrusted her to Van<br/>believing that she would exhibit so much<br/>unusual behavior.")
('Quatre', "So I think the root of the cause lies in Professor<br/>Epstein's legacy rather than her.")
('Quatre', 'Incidentally, an AI gaining free will is one thing that<br/>would qualify as a technological singularity.')
('Quatre', 'Which would mean that, put another way, something<br/>happened to Mare that allowed her to evolve past that<br/>massive hurdle.')
('Feri', 'Evolve...?')
('Aaron', "Now we're really in the Goddess' territory.")
('Agnès', 'The Testaments suggest that evolution was a process<br/>intended to let we humans shape the world around us.')
('Agnès', "It's also described as what's helped us bring about our<br/>latent potential.")
('Van', "That was from the Book of Shahat, Verse 2:<br/>Jokanan's Letter, I think?")
('Van', "Anyway, I think I get what you're sayin'.")
('Van', 'You wanna have a chance to observe<br/>everything, right?')
('Van', "Mare's appearance, the shards goin' berserk—in<br/>short, everything that happens from the start to<br/>me goin' Grendel.")
('Van', 'You wanna see it all, including what role the Geneses<br/>play in it.')
('Agnès', 'Oh...')
('Quatre', 'Exactly. I think that knowledge will help me support<br/>Agnès in her quest for answers, too.')
('Quatre', "It might also let you call on the Grendel's power in a<br/>less haphazard and dangerous way.")
('Quatre', 'What do you think? Does that work for you?')
('Van', 'Sure.')
('Van', "We've got five Geneses so far, which leaves three<br/>still out there to recover.")
('Van', "We can't be sure the mafia has the rest, but if we get<br/>any more chances to stop 'em from causin' any<br/>trouble, we should take 'em.")
('Van', "And if I end up with a good excuse to transform in<br/>our future work, we'll give it a shot.")
('Van', 'As long as we have a Genesis on hand, we should be<br/>able to brute force whatever the other transformation<br/>conditions are.')
('Van', 'Then we just gotta grab Mare-Bear when she shows<br/>up, right?')
('Quatre', "That's about the short of it.")
('Quatre', "I've already added the sensors necessary to observe her<br/>and record it all to FIO.")
('Quatre', "This could be a little dangerous, but I think it'll be<br/>worth our while to try.")
('Van', "Don't worry. I'll have you guys there to back me up,<br/>so I'm sure I'll be fine.")
('Feri', "Of course you will! We'll be right there with you all<br/>the way!")
('Aaron', 'This sounds like it could be fun.')
('Risette', 'I will be there to give any technology-related support<br/>that you may need.')
('Agnès', '...')
('Van', "We can't do any of this without a Genesis<br/>being there. If you're not on board, we won't go<br/>ahead with it.")
('Agnès', "...It's not that.")
('Agnès', "I can't deny that I'm worried you might be hurt in<br/>the process...")
('Agnès', '...but the chances of us learning something more<br/>about the Geneses and the Grendel through this<br/>are promising.')
('Agnès', "So I'll do all that I can to support you!")
('Van', "Then it's settled.")
('Van', "All right. Then let's get started on today's work.")
('Van', "I'm gonna need a few of you to handle some other<br/>stuff, but Quatre's trial period ain't over yet, so he's<br/>comin' with me.")
('Quatre', "That works for me—though I honestly can't imagine<br/>it would take me long to grasp exactly what you<br/>do here.")
('Quatre', 'But go ahead and show me exactly what being a<br/>spriggan is all about.')
('Agnès', "I'll back you up to the best of my ability.")
('System', 'Select one additional member to accompany Quatre,<br/>Agnès, and Van outside. The rest will<br/>work elsewhere.')
('System', 'Orbments can now be customized from the main<br/>menu now that Quatre is in the party.')
('XEROS', 'RUFF?')
('Maxim', 'Whoa!')
('Maxim', "O-Oh, it's just a dog... Wait, IS it?")
('Quatre', "It's a form of cutting-edge technology called an<br/>orbal drone. No need to be afraid—he won't bite.")
('Maxim', 'I-If you say so...')
('Maxim', 'Montmart... Is this a bistro? It looks so cozy.')
('Agnès', 'It is. The food served here is wonderful, too.')
('Feri', "And we're lucky enough to get to eat here all<br/>the time!")
('Maxim', "Hmm... It's no secret that holes in the wall like this<br/>tend to taste surprisingly good...")
('Maxim', 'I should blend in a lot better here than the luxury<br/>restaurants I usually frequent—')
('Yumé', "Hey-hey! What'cha doing?")
('Maxim', "WHOA-AAAH!<br/>...Uhh, huh? There's nobody here?")
('Yumé', 'Heehee. Got you!')
('Maxim', "Oh, it's just a child... Just what on earth was that for?!")
('Van', "She's the granddaughter of this bistro's owner.")
('Van', "Go easy on him, Yumes. He's technically a client.")
('Yumé', 'Okay! But you should still take off your glasses.<br/>They make you look weird!')
('Maxim', "W-Well, wasn't she a rude little thing!")
('Maxim', "I wouldn't be wearing these sunglasses if I had a<br/>choice in the matter!")
('Agnès', "D-Don't let it get to you...")
('Aaron', "You're the one who landed yourself in this situation,<br/>so you kinda did have a choice.")
('Risette', 'Perhaps we should make our way up to the office<br/>before we draw a crowd.')
('Maxim', 'Ugh...')
('Van', "Yeah. We'll hear your story up there.")
('Maxim', 'I want you to help me find someone.')
('Van', 'Getting right to the point, huh? Tell us more.')
('Maxim', "A woman, to be more specific. As you know, I'm<br/>single at the moment.")
('Maxim', 'However, there was one woman in the past I was very<br/>close to.')
('Maxim', 'We did break up after a while...')
('Maxim', '...but I later heard that she gave birth to our child.')
('Agnès', 'Oh, wow...')
('Aaron', "Heh. Buzzraider wasn't kidding about you being a<br/>piece of shit, huh?")
('Risette', 'They do say that our heroes are often corrupt. I see<br/>there is some truth to that.')
('Feri', 'Umm...')
('Feri', '...')
('Maxim', "Y-You're getting it all wrong!")
('Quatre', "Are we? I'm not so sure we are.")
('Maxim', 'A-At least let me explain how it all happened, please.')
('Maxim', 'It all began eight years ago, back when I<br/>was twenty-three.')
('Maxim', 'Z1 had just started to become a big thing, and I was a<br/>rookie racer who was struggling to make it into the<br/>big leagues.')
('Maxim', 'One day, I was in a major accident during one of my<br/>races and was badly injured.')
('Maxim', 'I was rushed to the hospital—and it was there we<br/>first met.')
('Maxim', 'She devoted her whole being to helping me recover<br/>and, thanks to her tireless care and physical<br/>therapy, I did. It was a downright miracle.')
('Maxim', 'When the time came for me to be discharged from<br/>the hospital, I summoned the courage to tell her how<br/>I felt, and the two of us started dating.')
('Maxim', 'She was both a strong-willed and kind woman, and<br/>before I knew it, I was head over heels in love<br/>with her.')
('Maxim', "After I'd begged her enough times, she agreed to live<br/>with me, too. It was a little while after that that I<br/>finally returned to racing.")
('Maxim', 'Thinking back, those were the happiest days of<br/>my life.')
('Maxim', 'Due in no small part to the support I got from her, I<br/>ended up winning my first post-recovery<br/>championship.')
('Maxim', 'Then I won the following championship. Then the<br/>next one after that... Before I knew it, people were<br/>treating me like some kind of hero.')
('Maxim', 'Everyone wanted my attention. I was out partying<br/>one night after another.')
('Maxim', "And, umm...I'm not proud of it, but I had more than<br/>a few one-night stands with other women around that<br/>time, too.")
('Maxim', '...Then one day, she suddenly disappeared from my<br/>life, leaving only a single note behind.')
('Maxim', "I was filled with regret from my actions, but I didn't<br/>know what to say to her—so I just wallowed in<br/>self-loathing and let her go.")
('Maxim', 'But two years later, I went to visit that same hospital<br/>where we first met for a regular checkup...')
('Maxim', "...and learned by pure chance that when she'd left me,<br/>she'd learned she was pregnant and also left her job.")
('Maxim', 'I was so shocked that I tried to get a coworker she<br/>was close with to give me a way to contact her.')
('Maxim', "But she wouldn't give me a drop of information, no<br/>matter what I said.")
('Maxim', "I pestered her enough that she told me she'd call the<br/>guild if I didn't stay away from her.")
('Agnès', "That's... I think I'd do the same in her position,<br/>too, honestly.")
('Feri', 'You really are the worst.')
('Maxim', 'Erk...')
('Quatre', "Well, I certainly see why you can't ask the police for<br/>help with this.")
('Risette', 'She chose to remove you from her life. Trying to<br/>chase her down now would likely just be seen<br/>as stalking.')
('Aaron', "Haha! Yeah, if you went to the guild with this, you'd<br/>be in for a bad time.")
('Maxim', 'Argh...')
('Van', "So that's why when this latest news hit, you decided<br/>to come to us.")
('Maxim', "That's right. You might not believe me, but I've<br/>changed a lot since then.")
('Maxim', "I do still go out partying, but I've always kept myself<br/>in check. I swear that on Aidios' name.")
('Maxim', "I've actually been using a lot of my free time over the<br/>past few years traveling around in hopes of finding<br/>her and our child.")
('Maxim', 'Make that four years, in fact...')
('Agnès', 'Wow...')
('Risette', 'That is quite a lot of time.')
('Feri', 'Erm...')
('Aaron', "Still, even if you aren't actually dating Lanster, it sure<br/>sounds like you were happy to 'get to know her a bit<br/>better,' if you catch my drift.")
('Agnès', '...')
('Maxim', "Sh-She just asked me out for a meal and I accepted!<br/>Really, there wasn't anything more to it than that.")
('Maxim', "We'd never interacted much before that, so I didn't<br/>have a clue why she invited me—and I certainly had<br/>no intentions of crossing any lines with her...")
('Maxim', "Besides, what man in my position WOULDN'T be<br/>at least a little tempted if such a beautiful woman<br/>made a move on him?!")
('Quatre', 'And here come the excuses.')
('Van', "I'd bet mira that if this ex of yours saw that<br/>Buzzraider story, she'd start shakin' her head.")
('Maxim', 'Erk...')
('Maxim', "You're right. Perhaps that should have been enough<br/>to sever the last sliver of hope remaining for me...if<br/>there was ever any hope at all.")
('Maxim', "But as long as I still have a chance, please!<br/>I'm begging you—I need your help!")
('Feri', 'Erm...')
('Aaron', "Well, nothing we've heard so far tells me you didn't<br/>bring this all on yourself...")
('Quatre', "Not a bit of it. But I think it still qualifies as a 4SPG<br/>based on Van's guidelines.")
('Risette', "Indeed. It's a request that can't be taken to the guild<br/>or the police while still being within reason.")
('Agnès', 'Van...')
('Van', "So, what's her name? Do you have any photos of her?")
('Maxim', "S-Sorry, but I can't tell you her name just yet.")
('Maxim', "I know you've saved me before, but I'm still not fully<br/>sure I can trust you.")
('Maxim', "I don't want to cause any more trouble for her or our<br/>child than I already have.")
('Van', '...Oh?')
('Aaron', "Not sure you should be making demands when you've<br/>got nowhere else to go.")
('Agnès', 'Perhaps, though I do understand his intent.')
('Risette', 'You can never be too careful.')
('Feri', 'What are we going to be using to find them, then?')
('Quatre', "We'll at least want a photograph. That would give us<br/>some options in searching.")
('Maxim', "Unfortunately, I don't have any.")
('Maxim', "That's part of the reason why I've been reduced to<br/>wandering around searching for them myself.")
('Maxim', "But it only occurred to me recently that there IS one<br/>picture I took with her still in existence—I just don't<br/>have it.")
('Maxim', 'Before we moved in together, we went to Dirke<br/>Memorial Park on a date.')
('Maxim', "While we were there, we participated in a special<br/>event in an area of the park that's now been closed off<br/>due to monsters.")
('Maxim', "The picture's in a time capsule we buried in front of<br/>the memorial tree there. I want you to come and help<br/>me dig it up.")
('Maxim', 'This really does look like a nice little bistro.')
('Feri', 'The stew and the hamburg steaks are my favorites!')
('Aaron', "The food they serve with alcohol isn't half bad, either.<br/>They know what pairs perfect with baijiu.")
('Van', "Figures you'd go right for the hard drinks...")
('Maxim', "Ack... You're making me want to stop by once we're<br/>done at the park.")
('Maxim', "...No, I can't. I'd just attract attention and cause<br/>them trouble.")
('Quatre', "You're worrying yourself over nothing if you ask me...")
('Risette', "They also do takeout if that's more to your liking.")
('Agnès', 'We can vouch for those, too. Their sandwiches are<br/>always first rate.')
('Yumé', 'Aww... Work must be super busy for them, huh?')
('Paulette', 'Are they already off on another job?')
('Yumé', 'Yeah. They drove off with some weird guy with<br/>blond hair.')
('Paulette', "Heehee. You're so silly, Yumé. Well, are you ready<br/>to go?")
('Yumé', 'Yup! Yaaay, I get to go shopping with Mommy!')
('Yumé', "I'm all done, Grandpa!")
('Victor', "All done? Well, aren't you such a good girl, Yumé?")
('Maxim', "Yumé... So that's her name...")
('Feri', 'Come to think of it, your eyes are the same color<br/>as hers.')
('Aaron', "Tch. Would've been a better twist if she was someone<br/>else's kid.")
('Maxim', 'N-No, it would not!')
('Quatre', 'I hope we did the right thing by telling him where<br/>she lives...')
('Agnès', "I-I have my doubts, too, but it's not as though<br/>she's married.")
('Risette', "And I'm not sure how we could have talked our way<br/>out of telling him after our reactions earlier...")
('Van', "*sigh* I can't believe the diva of the diner used to date<br/>this guy...")
('Maxim', 'Well, sorry for not living up to your standards! ...I<br/>really do appreciate your help finding her, though.')
('Maxim', "But where IS Paulette? I don't recall seeing her<br/>earlier, either.")
('Van', "Maybe buyin' extra stuff? Sounds about right at this<br/>time of day.")
('Quatre', "FIO's helping her, but I'm sure she still needs to go<br/>out herself sometimes.")
('Paulette', "Oh, you'd be surprised just how much of a help that<br/>little one has been.")
('Feri', 'Paulette!')
('Agnès', 'Erm... How long have you been standing there?')
('Paulette', "...? I was just over at Brenda's store buying some<br/>extra seasonings.")
('Paulette', 'Oh...')
('Paulette', '...')
('Maxim', "H-Hey... It's...umm... I, uh...I don't really know<br/>what I'm doing...")
('Feri', '(...!)')
('Aaron', "(Dude's going for it, huh?)")
('Maxim', "I-It's been a while, hasn't it?")
('Paulette', 'Ah! Do we have ourselves a new customer?')
('Paulette', "It's nice to meet you. I'm Paulette, an employee at<br/>this bistro.")
('Paulette', "So you must be a friend of Van's?")
('Quatre', '(Rest in peace...)')
('Risette', '(*sigh* Her reaction comes as no surprise, of course.)')
('Maxim', 'Aha...haha... Yeah, you could say that.')
('Maxim', 'Sorry. It looks like I mistook you for someone else.')
('Maxim', "I suppose I should get out of your hair now. I'll wire<br/>you your mira as soon as I get a chance.")
('Agnès', 'M-Maxim!')
('Van', "Sorry to burst your bubble when you're tryin' to play it<br/>cool, but you leavin' your Leno here?")
('Paulette', 'Heehee...')
('Paulette', "I can see you've had quite the busy day.")
('Paulette', "It's almost time to close up shop for the day, but if<br/>you haven't eaten yet, you're welcome to come in<br/>for something.")
('Maxim', '...')
('Maxim', '...Are you...sure about that?')
('Paulette', "Of course. Montmart's doors are open to anyone<br/>and everyone.")
('Paulette', "You're all welcome to come in, too, of course. I'll go<br/>hop in the kitchen.")
(500, 'November 9th, 6:20PM')
('Maxim', '*sniffle* This food tastes so good...and yet<br/>strangely salty... *sniffle*')
('Victor', 'Paulette...')
('Paulette', 'Huh? What is it?')
('Victor', 'Well, nothing, but...')
('Yumé', "Heeey... What'cha crying for, mister?")
('Aaron', "He's in for a long ride if that's anything to go by.")
('Feri', 'Ahaha... There might be a light at the end of the<br/>tunnel for him, though.')
('Risette', 'Even if he will have to keep proving his sincerity to<br/>earn it.')
('Agnès', "True, but if he can, I'm sure everything will work out<br/>for the best.")
('Van', "All right, then. That's another job well done.")
('Van', 'I bet he earns a boatload, so he better get ready to<br/>pay up.')
('Van', "And y'know, no matter how damn good a racecar<br/>driver he is, I'm not so sure I wanna accept him as<br/>Yumé's dad.")
('Agnès', "It doesn't hurt to be happy for people, Van...")
('Quatre', "I might be with him here... I've only just met<br/>Paulette, but I can tell she's a lovely woman who<br/>deserves only the best.")
('Van', "All the regulars downstairs love her, too. I've been in<br/>her debt for years, myself.")
('Van', "Hmph. Still, I can't imagine it'll be easy for him to<br/>get back into her good graces, so I'll just sit back and<br/>watch smugly till he does.")
('Feri', "Yeah! He should suffer a little for all he's done.")
('Aaron', "He's really gonna have his work cut out if he wants<br/>the old man and the kid to welcome him into their<br/>lives, too.")
('Agnès', '*sigh* I think you all need to be a little more forgiving<br/>of others...')
('Risette', "Changing the subject, however...we certainly had<br/>some interesting developments on another front,<br/>didn't we?")
('Agnès', 'Did we ever... Even if it feels like the number of<br/>questions that need answering has only increased.')
('Van', "Well, we've had dinner, and we still got plenty of<br/>time left before we need to call it a day...")
('Van', 'You mind getting to work, Quatre?')
('Quatre', 'Not at all. This is our time to shine.')
('Quatre', 'Yeah, I think this should be enough data to narrow<br/>down the triggers for making Mare appear.')
('Quatre', "If you'll give me a hand, I should be able to have the<br/>job done by tonight, even.")
('Risette', 'I would be delighted to. I have a wireless network set<br/>up already, so that should help.')
('Van', "You've been gettin' yourselves all set up here while I<br/>wasn't looking, huh?")
('Agnès', "Heehee. I think that's a good thing. We can't rely on<br/>Renne for every little thing, after all.")
('Quatre', "Just don't expect me to work as fast as she does.<br/>I don't think I have that in me.")
('Risette', 'The infamous Kitty is extraordinarily capable as<br/>a hacker. No ordinary operator could hope<br/>to compare.')
('Feri', 'All of you might as well be using some kind of magic<br/>to me...')
('Aaron', "As long as they're willing to do all that work, I'm not<br/>even gonna think about it. Just leave the tech to<br/>the pros.")
('Aaron', "So, do you think you'll be able to turn into the<br/>Grendel without putting yourself in mortal danger?")
('Van', 'In theory, it should be possible.')
('Quatre', 'It looks like Agnès being in the vicinity with at least<br/>one Genesis is a mandatory condition, though.')
('Agnès', "So far, you've constantly been putting yourself in<br/>serious danger just to transform and help us win...")
('Agnès', "...so I sincerely hope there's some way for you to<br/>transform without having to resort to that.")
('Agnès', 'And we should be conscious of what Mare said about<br/>not relying on the Grendel too much.')
('Agnès', "We'll all do what we can to support you so that you<br/>don't have to. I won't let you always shoulder most of<br/>the burden yourself.")
('Van', '...')
('Feri', "I won't, either! I'm going to keep getting stronger so I<br/>can help more!")
('Aaron', "I don't actually care how much danger you have to<br/>put yourself in, but I'm not down to have you always<br/>steal our thunder.")
('Risette', 'As the concierge assigned to support you, I have been<br/>opposed to you exposing yourself to unnecessary risk<br/>from the start.')
('Van', 'Listen here...')
('Quatre', "I'm inclined to agree.")
('Quatre', 'After what Mare said, I think this is something you<br/>should absolutely only use against the strongest<br/>of opponents.')
('Van', '*sigh* Fine.')
('Van', "(The more people who come work for me, the less I<br/>feel like I'm the one in charge...)")
('Agnès', 'Do you have something else you want to say?')
('Van', 'Nope. Not at all.')
('Aaron', "Man, someone's whipped.")
('Feri', 'Ahaha... Oh, by the way!')
('Feri', "We still don't have any idea why we couldn't<br/>understand some of what Mare was saying, right?")
('Van', 'Oh, yeah. Almost forgot about that.')
('Mare', "I'm being gracious enough to lend you a helping<br/>hand as a ㌍㌫㌻㍊㍍ under the influence of<br/>the ㌍㌫㌻㍊㍍!")
('Mare', 'Just be careful. Using it too much will<br/>cause ㌍㌫㌻㍊㌫㍊㌻㍊㌫㍍.')
('Quatre', "We heard what she was saying—it was more like our<br/>brains couldn't process it or something.")
('Risette', "That's how I would put it. It was almost as if we were<br/>listening to an audio recording, and part of it was<br/>replaced by noise.")
('Aaron', "Yeah. Kinda creepy, if we're being real here.")
('Agnès', "It was like we came dangerously close to one of this<br/>world's many secrets...")
('Agnès', "...I-I'm sorry! Just forget I said something so silly.<br/>I've clearly read one too many books.")
('Feri', "I don't think it was silly at all. If anything, it<br/>sounds right.")
('Risette', "I think it's a possibility we ought to keep in mind.")
('Van', 'Yeah, for sure.')
('Van', '...Hmm? Maybe a client?')
('Ashen', "Oh, I got through! Whew—I was worried I didn't<br/>have the right number.")
('Agnès', 'That sounds like...')
('Aaron', 'Ashen?')
('Ashen', 'Wanshang hao! Good evening, guys!')
('Ashen', "It feels like I haven't talked to you in ages.")
('Agnès', "It's good to see you again, Ashen!")
('Feri', 'It really is. What are you calling about?')
('Aaron', 'Decided to give up on Cao and go after this old<br/>fart instead?')
('Ashen', 'O-Of course not! You shut up, Aaron!')
('Ashen', "I hope he hasn't been raising too much of a ruckus<br/>over in Edith, by the way. Especially when it comes<br/>to women.")
('Agnès', 'Umm... About that...')
('Feri', 'He does come home smelling like<br/>perfume sometimes.')
('Aaron', 'What can I say? I like getting to know people.')
('Van', "Can we be serious for five minutes around here?!<br/>Also, I'm five years younger than Cao, I'll have<br/>you know!")
('Quatre', "I can't believe you know that off the top of<br/>your head... Also, sorry to ask, but I don't think we've<br/>met before.")
('Risette', 'I assume she is connected to Heiyue in some manner?')
('Ashen', 'Oh, Aaron did mention that you have some<br/>new part-timers.')
('Ashen', "I'm Ashen Lu. I am indeed part of one of the families<br/>of Heiyue.")
('Ashen', 'Wait—your new part-timers are a maid and a<br/>pretty boy? Arkride Solutions never settles for<br/>average, does it?')
('Van', "Our cast is a colorful one, yeah... So, what's<br/>this about?")
('Van', 'Is Cao causing trouble again?')
('Ashen', "I wouldn't say that. He's as busy as always.")
('Ashen', "And actually, I didn't just call you on behalf of<br/>Heiyue today. This message is from several<br/>others, too.")
('Van', 'Really, now?')
('Aaron', 'What message?')
('Ashen', 'Well, Bàbà had the chance to talk to a few other<br/>important people with different affiliations the<br/>other day.')
('Ashen', 'And apparently, the topic ended up shifting to you<br/>guys, and they agreed to do a little something<br/>special for you.')
('Ashen', "You know, for all you've done for the people of<br/>Langport, Tharbad, and Basel.")
('Ashen', 'Consider it a special thank-you gift from everyone.')
('Van', 'Hang on a minute...')
('Agnès', "The important people you're talking about wouldn't<br/>happen to be...?")
('Ashen', "Mm-hmm. I'm calling on behalf of Elsaim's Crown<br/>Prince Sherid, the Basel Institute of Science's<br/>Professor Hamilton...")
('Ashen', "...the Kowloon Group's Fan Lu, and one other<br/>individual—whose name I will not disclose—to extend<br/>you an invitation.")
('Ashen', 'They all want you to spend two nights at the five-star<br/>Hekizanro Inn in the eastward hot springs paradise<br/>of Longlai.')
('Ashen', 'Your tickets should arrive shortly! ❤')
(40000, 'Evening! Special delivery!')
(500, 'November 9th, 8:05PM')
('Van', "...There's no way there isn't more to this than<br/>it seems.")
('Van', "But it's true we've been real busy lately. Would be a<br/>good chance to get some R&R...")
('Van', 'Man... Longlai sure brings back some memories.')
('Bergard', 'Your mindset is very different from that of others.')
('Bergard', 'It has long convinced you that there is no place for<br/>you in this world.')
('Bergard', 'And that is, from my perspective, proof positive that<br/>you still have so much to learn.')
('Bergard', "For everything in this world is connected. I'm sure<br/>you will one day come to that realization yourself with<br/>enough firsthand experience.")
('Van', '(He always tried to pretend he was normal, but he<br/>was anything but.)')
('Van', "(Wish I'd been able to avenge him, but that chance is<br/>long gone now.)")
('Van', "(Still, I suppose Longlai wouldn't be a bad place to<br/>visit to pay my respects since I can't get over to<br/>his grave.)")
('Van', '(My crew could use a break about now, too.)')
('Van', "Anyway, I guess I'll go wander around for a while<br/>before turnin' in.")
('Van', "We're gonna be away for three days, so I wanna make<br/>sure everything's in order before we head out.")
(500, 'November 14th, 1208, 6:30AM')
('Yumé', "Okay! I'm gonna head out now!")
('Victor', "We'll be right here when you get back. Be<br/>careful, now!")
('Victor', "Take good care of her for us. We're counting on you!")
('Van', 'I know, I know.')
('Feri', "She's in safe hands with us!")
('Paulette', "Thank you for looking after her. If she starts being<br/>selfish or making a fuss, don't be afraid to give her a<br/>talking-to.")
('Paulette', 'We want you to have lots of fun, but we also need<br/>you to be a good girl, okay?')
('Paulette', "And don't forget to brush your teeth and use the<br/>bathroom before you go to bed.")
('Yumé', "I won't!")
('Agnès', "Heehee. She's always a good girl. She'll be fine.")
('Risette', "We'll be sure to keep a close eye on her at all times.")
('Quatre', "Umm... I'll be there for her, too.")
('Aaron', 'Ehh, I can help her pick out souvenirs or something.')
('Victor', '...So, what did you want to talk about?')
('Paulette', 'Well...')
('Paulette', "This conversation might take a while, so I think I'll<br/>go make us some coffee first.")
(500, 'November 16th, 6:52PM')
('Paulette', "Oh, Yumé! Thank Aidios you're back!")
('Yumé', "Huh? What's wrong, Mommy?")
('Paulette', "Welcome home, all of you. I'm so relieved to see<br/>you're safe.")
('Agnès', 'I-Is everything all right...?')
('Aaron', "Come on, now. This isn't like you.")
('Feri', 'Wh-What happened? Why does everyone look<br/>so serious?')
('Quatre', 'An orbal radio? Oh, wait...')
('Risette', 'Is everyone gathered for the announcement<br/>mentioned earlier?')
('Van', "Guess so...<br/>(Then the official announcement must be<br/>comin' from...)")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Van...')
('Agnès', 'M-Marielle...?')
('Van', "Oh, it's you. Wait—what's wrong?")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Dingo's... Dingo, he's...")
('Van', 'What about him? I did get a message from<br/>him earlier...')
(40301, "It's about to start!")
(40302, "Th-Those rumors can't be true, right? That...eil...ed...")
('Victor', 'Just shut up and listen!')
('Feri', '...Huh?')
('Judith', 'Here it comes.')
(40000, "Good evening. Today's 7PM news will begin with an<br/>emergency announcement.")
(40000, 'This announcement is being brought to you by none<br/>other than the Presidential Office. We ask that you<br/>listen closely.')
(40000, "I bring you this emergency announcement from the<br/>Presidential Office in Edith's Vantail District.")
('Agnès', 'Oh...')
('Risette', "Isn't that...?")
('Aaron', "Hold up a sec... Isn't that the spec's voice?")
('Van', 'Yeah...')
('Kincaid', 'As President Gramheart is engaged with<br/>time-sensitive matters, I, Kincaid, will be speaking on<br/>his behalf as his provisional aide.')
('Kincaid', 'This is an announcement that deeply pains me to<br/>make—and one that will be equally painful to hear.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Dingo went... He went to Creil yesterday.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "He'd found a new lead, you see—one that said the<br/>mafia was going to do something awful.")
('Kincaid', 'Before dawn today, in the Vichy County in<br/>northwest Calvard...')
('Kincaid', '...the village of Creil was engulfed in a monumental<br/>explosion from an unknown weapon.')
('Quatre', 'Huh...?')
('Feri', "That can't mean...")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'I... I wanted to go and see what he was doing...')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "...but the whole area was blocked to traffic...and my<br/>editors wouldn't let me go, either!")
('Kincaid', 'The village and its surroundings were<br/>completely annihilated. There are believed to be<br/>no survivors.')
('Agnès', '...')
('Feri', 'Oh, no...')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Van, what—just what am I supposed to do?!')
('Kincaid', 'In light of the circumstances, a presidential executive<br/>order has been issued...')
('Kincaid', '...declaring a state of emergency across the entirety of<br/>the Republic of Calvard.')
('Kincaid', 'We ask that all of you cooperate with local and<br/>national authorities and remain calm.')
('System', 'Main 4SPG [Finding Memories] completed!<br/>Received')
(500, 'November 19th, 1208, 1:03PM')
('Quatre', "I can't believe it. They managed to forcibly detonate<br/>the weapon...")
('Feri', "This can't be happening...")
('Agnès', '...')
('Risette', 'I see now just how capable he was.')
('Risette', 'He uploaded the footage to the orbal network cloud<br/>by combining his camera and Xipha to distribute it<br/>across rural wireless networks.')
('Risette', 'Had he not done so, the footage would have surely<br/>been lost.')
('Van', "He was one of the most irritatingly charming guys<br/>I've ever met. He was charismatic as all hell.")
('Van', 'Everything he did was perfect to a tee, but he never<br/>let his talents get to his head.')
('Van', "He probably knew this would happen, but he still<br/>didn't turn back. What was that dumbass thinking...?")
('Agnès', 'Van...')
('Judith', 'He did a lot for me and Nina.')
('Agnès', 'Same for all of us as well... To say nothing of all the<br/>people in Creil.')
('Feri', '...')
('Aaron', "How'd they figure out how to use a nuclear weapon?<br/>I thought they weren't able to finish it.")
('Van', "Don't think they did. They had to've been pretty<br/>close to completion, though.")
('Van', "And they must've been able to bridge the gap with<br/>the explosive lens and an artifact.")
('Quatre', 'They abandoned the scientific process and relied on<br/>brute force to achieve their desired outcome.')
('Quatre', 'And they trampled on the wishes of Professor<br/>Callaghan all the while.')
('Judith', 'So what are we going to do now?')
('Judith', 'A whole lot of people have access to this video.')
('Van', "Not like it's been released to the public, but yeah, a<br/>lotta people have got their hands on it now.")
('Agnès', "I can't believe the CID effectively resorted to<br/>blackmailing you—just to get access to the video.")
('Agnès', "They could've simply seized the server it was on and<br/>blocked access to it until we provided the password<br/>Dingo left with you.")
('Quatre', "Regardless, they didn't leave us with much choice.<br/>Now it's in the hands of the army's and police's top<br/>brass, as well as the guild.")
('Quatre', "I'm certain other nations' intelligence agencies and<br/>criminal groups have it as well.")
('Risette', 'I asked Marduk HQ if they have it, but they just said<br/>they will get back to me when they have an answer.')
('Risette', 'They are being coy, in other words, so I believe it is<br/>safe to assume they have it also.')
('Van', "Who doesn't have it at this point?")
('Van', "Doubt puttin' it out there was the CID's<br/>decision alone.")
('Van', "I'm thinkin' there's a higher power at play here—the<br/>highest in all of Calvard.")
('Agnès', '...')
('Feri', 'Huh? Why would the president want it?')
('Aaron', "Dunno, but if he's making a big claim like that, he's<br/>probably got some idea of why he would.")
('Aaron', "Though there's one thing we can all agree on: we<br/>can't let these guys get away with this shit any longer.")
('Van', 'You got that right. We just need to sniff out their<br/>next move.')
('Van', "They wouldn't pull a stunt like this without a plan.<br/>There's gotta be a follow-up act.")
('Van', "It'd fit with what that guy in the armor told us, too.")
('Arioch', "Like I said, the real fun'll begin at our next<br/>play date...")
('Arioch', 'In a joyous carnival of blood and violence the likes of<br/>which the world has never seen.')
('Agnès', 'Yes. The tragedy struck on the night of that very day.')
('Agnès', 'They must have already been preparing for the attack<br/>on Creil when we met him.')
('Feri', 'Then they better be prepared to pay for it, too!')
('Risette', "It's safe to assume they were fully aware of how<br/>everyone would react to this incident.")
('Aaron', "Yeah. They wanted all eyes on them. Must've been<br/>what they were after from the word go.")
('Quatre', 'They manipulated Professor Callaghan, and when<br/>they got what they wanted, they tossed him aside like<br/>a used rag doll.')
('Quatre', 'And they proceeded to use his work for the most<br/>heinous purpose imaginable—with flagrant disregard<br/>for human life. It makes me sick.')
('Van', "I still don't know what our best course of action is,<br/>but what I do know is that Dingo gave us a request<br/>that I—no, we can't refuse.")
('Van', "He chose to leave that video in our hands—so I'm<br/>seein' this thing through. It's the least I can do<br/>for him.")
('Van', 'You guys good with that?')
('Van', "Stuff's probably happenin' under the surface in<br/>Edith, too. We can start by hittin' up the notice<br/>boards while we keep our ears to the ground.")
('Van', 'We gotta figure out what the CID, the guild, and<br/>everyone else is up to.')
('Judith', "Makes sense to me. Then let's put our backs into it!")
('Van', "Uhh... So you've managed to make it this far without<br/>takin' no for an answer.")
('Van', "You do know this ain't got anything to do with<br/>you, right?")
('Judith', "Au contraire. It's got everything to do with me.")
('Judith', "These are the same bastards who ruined the film<br/>festival—and I've visited Creil for film shoots, too.")
('Feri', '...')
('Agnès', 'Oh, right...')
('Judith', "Plus I've already signed a lease for a room in<br/>this building.")
('Judith', "I've wanted a second home for a while—both as a safe<br/>haven from the paparazzi and as a hideout for my,<br/>umm...other gig.")
('Van', "I mean, hey, I'm not about to turn away help when it<br/>comes knockin', but you're...uh...gonna attract a lot of<br/>attention out there.")
('Judith', "Oh, you think I'll be recognized?")
('Judith', "Not to worry. I'm not third in a line of phantom<br/>thieves for nothing.")
(40301, 'So what do you think? Impressive, right?')
('Feri', "Whoa! That's so cool!")
('Aaron', 'Sounds like a bargain-bin comic book.')
('Quatre', "So that's one of the tools of your trade. I wonder how<br/>it works...")
('Van', "Eh, that'll do. Now you won't get busted the moment<br/>you walk out the door... Probably.")
('Van', "Okay, gang. Let's get to work.")
('Van', "Same deal as always. One team stays inside, and the<br/>other goes out. Countin' on everyone to do<br/>their thing.")
('System', 'Select two additional members to accompany Judith,<br/>Agnès, and Van.')
('System', "Van's holo core was changed to Mare.")
('System', 'You can change your holo core by pressing  in the<br/>Orbment menu.')
('Bergard', 'I am Bergard Zeman—though I was once known by<br/>another name.')
('Bergard', 'I see you have brought quite a number of fledglings<br/>under your wing, Van. Very interesting.')
('Van', "Not as interesting as the dead man who's back from<br/>the grave. Mind sharin' how you managed that?")
('Bergard', 'That is a very long story. Another time, perhaps.')
('Bergard', "Hard to believe it's already been five years—even<br/>harder to believe you're the same troublemaker I<br/>once knew...")
('Bergard', '...and that those same words of wisdom would come<br/>from your mouth, no less. I see you are living in<br/>accordance with your own principles.')
('Van', "P-Please. I didn't do anything. I just echoed the<br/>words of a much wiser man.")
('Aaron', "Is my man being bashful? Never thought I'd see<br/>the day.")
('Judith', "Haha. It's certainly a rare sight.")
('Quatre', "It's rather cute, to be honest.")
('Van', 'Oh, shove it!')
('Feri', 'Heehee. Well, you did do a good job putting Marielle<br/>at ease.')
('Agnès', 'Yes. I think you helped her regain some of her<br/>old spirit.')
('Risette', 'Those words were quite touching. Very befitting of<br/>you—and of Mr. Brad.')
('Agnès', 'Yeah. They resonated deeply with me as well.')
('Quatre', 'Thinking about the gap between what I can do and<br/>what I want to do is an interesting thought<br/>experiment, if nothing else.')
('Aaron', 'Heh.')
('Van', 'Can we PLEASE move on from this topic?')
('Van', 'Oh, yeah. I should let my employees<br/>introduce themselves. Agnès, you go first.')
('Agnès', 'Gladly. My name is...')
('Feri', "W-Wow. That's quite a history. Honestly, I had<br/>trouble keeping up with it all.")
('Risette', "So you were among the twelve knights who lead the<br/>church's Gralsritter.")
('Risette', "I've heard much about your various exploits,<br/>Roaring Lion.")
('Van', "It's a famous name in a lot of circles, so it's<br/>not surprising.")
('Bergard', '*sigh* Once again, that name is no longer mine.<br/>I would ask that you keep that in mind.')
('Aaron', 'Now we know why we passed you on the way<br/>to Longlai.')
('Quatre', "So you arranged our invitation there? And I'm<br/>guessing a few others played a part in that as well.")
('Quatre', "Namely...Professor Hamilton, Heiyue's future elder,<br/>the crown prince of Elsaim, and former<br/>President Rocksmith? Am I correct?")
('Bergard', 'Bullseye. I happen to be acquainted with all of them,<br/>including the grand prince of Elsaim and Elder Gien.')
('Bergard', 'The former president was anxious to make your<br/>acquaintance, and I believed meeting him would<br/>prove to be beneficial for your future.')
('Bergard', 'Though it pains me that a well-intentioned invitation<br/>coincided with such a horrific tragedy.')
('Judith', "Hey, it's not like you could've seen that one coming.")
('Agnès', "Even if we hadn't been in Longlai, we would have<br/>been powerless to stop it regardless.")
('Van', "Yeah. The only one who could've foretold that would<br/>be the Goddess Herself.")
('Van', "Anyway, I knew you'd gone off to the Empire after<br/>you finished training me five years ago.")
('Van', "Then I heard you bit the dust durin' a border dispute<br/>in Nord. They said you laid down your life protecting<br/>one of your students.")
('Van', "But here you are—alive and well. You cheated death<br/>and carried on livin'—just without your title<br/>and mark.")
('Van', "Won't pry into what you've been doin' all these years,<br/>but can you at least tell me why you never<br/>contacted me?")
('Bergard', 'Before I answer, I should note that you were not the<br/>only one in the dark.')
('Bergard', 'I did not reach out to my other students, either, and I<br/>never intended to do so. I wanted you all to walk your<br/>own paths...')
('Bergard', '...and I intended to leave my survival a secret—a<br/>trump card that I could pull out in the wake of<br/>a crisis.')
('Van', 'Bah.')
('Van', "Guessin' you figured it was time to play that<br/>card, then. To help us with THIS crisis.")
('Bergard', 'Correct. I have news regarding the mafia Almata and<br/>the assassins of the Gardens.')
('Bergard', 'Their whereabouts were discovered several hours ago.')
('Aaron', 'What?!')
('Feri', 'Where?!')
('Bergard', "Almata's leader and executives, as well as the<br/>Gardens' overseers, have established a new base...")
('Bergard', '...and it is located in a city within this very country.')
('Bergard', "What's more, that information has been passed<br/>around to all the major players in this nation.")
('Quatre', 'W-Wait... All of them?')
('Feri', 'Guess that means the army, the police, and the guild<br/>are all in the know.')
('Risette', 'I assume Heiyue and other jaeger corps are also<br/>aware of this new base?')
('Bergard', 'Yes. I imagine they are all preparing to take action at<br/>this very moment.')
('Bergard', "This country's supreme authority is no exception.<br/>They have resolved to quell the unfolding chaos.")
('Bergard', 'And they will do so by any means necessary—even if<br/>that involves fighting one evil with another.')
('Agnès', '...')
('Aaron', "So that's what Gien was talking about earlier.")
('Feri', "I'm sure many jaeger corps will be all over this—my<br/>people included.")
('Risette', 'Marduk HQ will likely be making their move as well.')
('Quatre', "You can't be serious!")
('Judith', 'All of these groups are going to flood the city<br/>at once?!')
('Van', 'So where do you stand in all this, Master?')
('Van', "By the sounds of it, these people're gonna try to<br/>capture Almata alive—or go after their heads.")
('Van', 'Some might even be aiming to get their grubby little<br/>hands on one of those nuclear devices.')
('Quatre', '...')
('Aaron', 'That...would be really bad.')
('Van', "Granted, I don't know how likely that is. Just having<br/>one of those things would make you public enemy<br/>number one.")
('Van', "It ain't a stretch, though. There's plenty of historical<br/>precedent for groups using artifacts as weapons.")
('Van', "So, given the stakes, what're you planning to do?")
('Bergard', 'As it stands, I am effectively dead. If the people of my<br/>former home decide to act, I will not join them nor<br/>stand in their way.')
('Bergard', 'However, now that the gift of life has been bestowed<br/>upon me once more, I intend to honor it by<br/>supporting the youths whose futures are so bright.')
('Bergard', 'And also...to keep them safe from venomous fiends—<br/>like these unwanted guests of yours.')
('Van', '...')
('Aaron', '...?!')
('Feri', 'Uh-oh...')
('Agnès', '...')
('Quatre', 'Wh-What?!')
('Van', "Hey, we're busy in here. 'Fraid you'll have to come<br/>back another day.")
('Harwood', 'That so? What a shame.')
('Harwood', 'And after we came all this way to give you a job...and<br/>a little souvenir from your reporter friend.')
('Van', '...Fine. Get in here.')
('Harwood', "Knew that'd reel you in. Thanks, bud.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'Heehee. Do excuse us.')
('Feri', '...')
('Aaron', 'I recognize you two...')
('Van', "It's the shady duo from that nightclub in Tharbad.")
('Van', 'I also met you back in Longlai.')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'Oh? You recognized me after all?')
('Harwood', 'Heheheh. Nice to finally meet you all, ladies and<br/>gentlemen of Arkride Solutions.')
('Harwood', "Oh? Now there's a face I never thought I'd see again.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "Oho. Neither did I. Tell me, what's a dead man doing<br/>out of his coffin?")
('Bergard', "*sigh* I was granted life once more. And I don't need<br/>to tell you the reason why—because you<br/>already know.")
('Harwood', "No need to give us the death glare, you old fossil.<br/>We've traded many friendly blows in the past,<br/>haven't we?")
('Harwood', "Why don't we bury the hatchet? Let's be like the<br/>jaegers—embrace yesterday's foe as today's friend.")
('Bergard', "I'm afraid I'll have to decline. Had the Azure Abyss<br/>or the late Steel Maiden made the suggestion, I<br/>would have entertained the thought.")
('Bergard', 'Not for you, though. Never in a million years.')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "Heehee. He's got your number, dear. No one will<br/>ever reconcile with you—and for that, you've no one<br/>to blame but yourself.")
('Harwood', "You're on thin ice. But your words are laced with<br/>the truth—venomous though they are.")
('Van', 'I get it now.')
('Van', "You're the guy the Direwolf and Renne warned<br/>us about.")
('Agnès', '...')
('Feri', "Y-You're...part of Ouroboros, then.")
('Risette', 'And one of their highest ranking members, at that.')
('Harwood', "The name's Ellroy Harwood. I'm the Fourth Anguis.")
('Harwood', 'But you can just call me the Oathbreaker.<br/>Everyone does.')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'I am Enforcer No. III, Lucrezia Isselee.')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "I'm delighted to make your acquaintance,<br/>Arkride Solutions.")
('Van', 'Hey, put that away. This is a smoke-free building.')
('Harwood', "Really, now? Very well, I promise I won't smoke<br/>in here.")
('Harwood', "Ooh. Accidentally went and made an oath there—and<br/>I can't afford to keep those.")
('Harwood', "I've got a reputation—and a title—to uphold, you see.<br/>Gotta break an oath or two from time to time.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', '...From time to time? You break oaths and rules as<br/>easily as you breathe.')
('Harwood', 'Haha. True, true.')
('Van', 'Ugh...')
('Harwood', 'Anyway, on to business. I want you to go on a little<br/>trip for me.')
('Aaron', 'Are you for real?')
('Agnès', "You're joking.")
('Harwood', "What, you're not up for it?")
('Harwood', 'Strange. I thought I heard you took work<br/>from anyone.')
('Van', "Yeah, if the work's reasonable—and if I like you.<br/>And your likeability's goin' up in smoke faster than<br/>the tobacco in that cigar.")
('Van', "I know you guys are after Almata. Hell, you probably<br/>know where they're at, too...")
('Van', "...but before we ask you where that is, I need to know<br/>why you've come to us.")
('Harwood', 'You gotta be kidding me. Do I really gotta spell<br/>it out?')
('Harwood', "It's 'cause you kids will make things way more fun.")
('Feri', '...')
('Quatre', 'F-Fun?!')
('Judith', "How can you even say that?! There's nothing FUN<br/>about this whole ordea—")
('Aaron', "Don't waste your energy on this guy. He isn't<br/>someone you can appeal to with logic or reason.")
('Harwood', "The society's already decided its course of action for<br/>this whole thing, and I'm leading the charge.")
('Harwood', 'Enforcer No. III will be backing me up—and so will<br/>Enforcer No. VIII, who you already know so well.')
('Harwood', "The goal's to round up the members of Almata and<br/>the Gardens—and murder every last one of them.")
('Van', "...I see. And you ain't doin' so in the name of justice,<br/>I'm guessing?")
('Harwood', "Nope. Had they kept to their little dog and pony<br/>shows, we wouldn't lay a finger on them.")
('Harwood', 'Honestly, I rather enjoyed kicking back and watching<br/>them wreak havoc.')
('Harwood', "But they've become a threat to our plans now—and<br/>we can't have that. If those little bugs want to punch<br/>above their weight...")
('Harwood', "...then we'll crush them beneath our feet.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'Heehee. Though no doubt it will be easier said<br/>than done.')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "They're both troublesome and insidious, and some<br/>rather formidable guests will be joining their party.")
('Agnès', 'Right. You will have some fierce competition.')
('Harwood', "Everyone's got different aims here. Some want them<br/>brought to justice, some want them dead and buried.")
('Harwood', "Heiyue will surely be joining the fray, and I'll bet the<br/>jaeger corps will be after their bounty. I'm guessing<br/>Marduk HQ will be there, too, yeah?")
('Risette', 'More than likely.')
('Bergard', "The guild won't stand idly by, either.")
('Bergard', 'Same goes for the Gralsritter. Artifacts are involved<br/>in this, after all.')
('Bergard', "And I wouldn't be surprised if other forces from the<br/>church showed up as well.")
('Harwood', 'Ah, right. You got students in other parts of the<br/>church—not just the Gralsritter.')
('Harwood', "Things are gonna get interesting, then. Must be<br/>tough being a master. I don't envy you.")
('Bergard', "If that is what fate has in store, then I will follow it.<br/>You needn't concern yourself with me.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'Regardless, that should serve as the basic overview of<br/>the situation.')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'Almata and the Gardens will not be the only sources<br/>of mischief in that city.')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "One wrong move and the whole affair could turn into<br/>an indiscriminate bloodbath—so someone ought to<br/>keep an eye on the little guys, don't you think?")
('Aaron', "In other words, civilians might get killed, and you<br/>aren't gonna look after them.")
('Judith', 'You guys are scum.')
('Quatre', 'Still, if Almata really does have another nuclear<br/>weapon in their possession...')
('Agnès', '...we have no other choice but to get involved.')
('Harwood', "You can use whatever justification you want. I don't<br/>really care why you join—just so long as you do.")
('Harwood', "'Cause if you don't, this whole thing will be a snooze<br/>cruise from start to finish. I need you kiddos to<br/>prevent this battle from being too one-sided.")
('Van', 'The hell do you mean by that?')
('Harwood', "The guild's the only one in this brawl that's gonna be<br/>fighting for the common man.")
('Harwood', "If we add you into the mix, however, it'll make for a<br/>more balanced blend—a recipe that's made for chaos.")
('Harwood', "Oh, and should you happen to run into us, I'd like<br/>you to come at me knives out—and ready to cut me<br/>into a million little pieces.")
('Harwood', "I'm very much into that sort of thing.")
('Feri', '...')
('Van', 'Hah. You are one masochistic bastard.')
('Van', "Well, we've got our reasons for chasing Almata down,<br/>so I'm not opposed to doin' this on the side.")
('Van', 'But first, I need to get one thing straight.')
('Van', 'I have a hunch you guys have some connection to<br/>either Almata or the Gardens.')
('Van', 'So spill it: what kinda relationship does Ouroboros<br/>have with them?')
('Harwood', 'Hmm?')
('Harwood', "Well, it isn't a close one, if that's what<br/>you're wondering.")
('Harwood', "We haven't exactly been keeping in touch as of late,<br/>but your hunch is on point. We do have a connection<br/>with the Gardens.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'You see, the two of us were once part of the Order of<br/>the Moonlight Horse—an organization of assassins.')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'Fourteen years ago, Ouroboros destroyed the order,<br/>but they extended a hand to the two of us and<br/>brought us into the fold.')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'Although, they did not do the same for many of its<br/>other members. The society is a small group of elites,<br/>and they only accept the best and brightest.')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'Fortune had not abandoned them, however.<br/>Shortly after, another villainous group was nearly<br/>wiped out in a major operation.')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'My companion here herded the lost sheep of both<br/>groups and let them form their own flock.')
('Agnès', 'Wait...')
('Quatre', "You don't mean...")
('Van', '...')
('Harwood', 'Has it already been fourteen years?')
('Harwood', "Heheheh. Time sure flies when you're having fun—<br/>and the society has offered me a wealth<br/>of entertainment.")
('Risette', 'From the data available to Marduk, there is only one<br/>operation that matches her story.')
('Van', "I REALLY hope it ain't the one I'm thinkin' of.")
('Van', "Please tell me the group y'all are talking about isn't—")
('Harwood', "It's exactly as you think: the D∴G cult.")
('Harwood', 'You know the ones—the devil worshipers that spread<br/>chaos across the Republic and the continent as<br/>a whole.')
('Quatre', '...!')
('Aaron', "No way... I've heard about those fiends from Cao.")
('Judith', 'And I heard about them from my grammy.')
('Harwood', 'I brought the remnants of the Moonlight Horse and<br/>the D∴G cult together...and set them loose on<br/>the world.')
('Harwood', "That's how the Gardens were created. They find<br/>seeds that are scattered by the wind and grow them<br/>into fresh assassins that are ripe for the picking.")
('Harwood', "Had I left them alone, the founding members<br/>would've rotted away, and their budding talent<br/>would have died on the vine.")
('Harwood', "But by mixing the leftovers of the cult and the order,<br/>I created a chemical reaction more potent than my<br/>wildest imagination could've conjured.")
('Harwood', 'I gave that one domino a little push—and look at all<br/>the tragedies and pain that befell the world.<br/>Heheheh.')
('Agnès', 'How...could you?')
('Feri', 'So this is all your fault!')
('Van', "I take back what I said earlier. You aren't just a<br/>masochistic bastard—you're also a sadistic monster.")
('Harwood', "Can't say you're wrong. My colleagues, like the<br/>Wellspring Alchemist and the professor, never go far<br/>enough for my tastes.")
('Harwood', "But that's humanity for you. No one's the same.<br/>We've all got our own desires that make us tick.")
('Van', "Yeah, and those things that make you 'tick' just so<br/>happen to tick me off.")
('Van', "I get what you want us to do, though. It also comes at<br/>the perfect time—given Dingo's last request.")
('Agnès', 'Van...')
('Aaron', "I don't like the idea of getting involved with these<br/>shitheads, but...you might be right.")
('Risette', 'So this gathering will include Marduk, Heiyue, the<br/>guild, and many other formidable groups.')
('Risette', 'Loath as I am to admit it, we may require their aid if<br/>we are to force our way inside.')
('Quatre', "S-Surely there's another way...")
('Judith', 'Yeah, I do NOT want to help a pair of<br/>cold-blooded killers!')
('Bergard', '...')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'You do not need to think of it as helping us.')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'You may instead think of it as entering a mutually<br/>beneficial relationship—where our goal is simply to<br/>use one another for our own ends.')
('Harwood', "I can take charge of laying the groundwork for the<br/>requests you'll get at the city. Those'll keep you<br/>plenty busy.")
('Harwood', "I'll even throw in a couple that'll give you a real thrill.")
('Van', "...As long as you don't slip a trap or two in 'em.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "My, my. They really don't trust you, do they?")
('Harwood', 'Anyway, sounds like we have ourselves a deal.')
('Harwood', "Oh! Almost forgot the other reason I came to this<br/>little office. Here's that souvenir I mentioned earlier.")
('Van', '...')
('Risette', "Are you sure it's safe...?")
('Harwood', "If you're worried about radiation, don't be.")
('Harwood', 'The professor—our technical expert—looked into the<br/>matter, and he found no traces of it whatsoever.')
('Harwood', 'The three disciples are probably racking their brains<br/>about that mystery this very moment.')
('Quatre', "There's no radioactive contamination? But all of the<br/>theories we have suggest—")
('Quatre', "No, wait... Perhaps they don't apply because the<br/>bomb was detonated in a non-traditional manner.")
('Van', '...')
('Bergard', 'Hmm...')
('Feri', "I'm so lost...")
('Aaron', 'Hang on a sec. You nabbed the camera before the<br/>authorities locked the scene down?')
('Van', "Won't ask how you managed to get there ahead of<br/>the cops, 'cause if I heard the answer...")
('Van', "...you'd be leavin' this room with a big ol' black eye.")
('Harwood', 'Ooh. Scary.')
('Van', "(It's in our hands now, Dingo.)")
('Harwood', "Guess we'll be off. We wouldn't want to overstay our<br/>welcome, now would we?")
('Harwood', 'I can hardly wait to see how you—and those relics of<br/>yours—will liven things up.')
('Agnès', '(He knows about the Geneses?)')
('Van', "...Haven't got a clue what you're on about. So, you<br/>gonna tell us where we're goin' or not?")
('Harwood', "Heheh. Why don't you ask the defanged lion?<br/>I've done enough talking for one day.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'Well, then. Have a lovely rest of your day!')
('Van', "Whew... Glad you were here, Master. I doubt I<br/>would've been able to keep my cool, otherwise.")
('Bergard', 'Nonsense. You would have handled things just fine<br/>on your own.')
('Bergard', "You held your ground well against them.<br/>You've grown into a fearless leader in my absence.")
('Van', "I think you're giving me too much credit.")
('Van', "All right, guys. I'm gonna ask that you all stay here.<br/>I'm goin' solo on this one.")
('Agnès', 'Huh? But why?')
('Van', "'Cause it's too dangerous. This is their turf, and<br/>everyone there'll be playin' by their rules.")
('Van', "There's no telling what'll happen there, and I can be a<br/>lot more flexible if I'm on my own.")
('Van', "Oh, but I can make an exception for Master. I figure<br/>I'm gonna need his help, at least.")
('Bergard', 'You figure right. That is precisely why I came in the<br/>first place.')
('Van', "Don't get me wrong. I don't think of y'all as a burden.<br/>This is just the best division of labor.")
('Van', "I'll need you to gather info, be the point of contact for<br/>other groups, work with the guild, and—")
('Van', '...Hey!')
('Aaron', 'You done flapping your gums yet?')
('Aaron', "Good. 'Cause I stopped listening when I heard the<br/>words 'it's too dangerous.'")
('Van', '...')
('Feri', "I appreciate that you're worried about us. I really do.<br/>However...")
('Quatre', 'We all have our reasons for wanting to go along<br/>with you.')
('Quatre', 'Mine is to ensure the nuclear devices can never again<br/>be used for malicious means.')
('Risette', 'Marduk considers this crisis to be a matter of grave<br/>concern, so it is only logical that I also<br/>accompany you.')
('Judith', "You said it yourself. I'm not even a part-timer here to<br/>begin with—which means you can't order me around.")
('Judith', "I'm a phantom thief, so I'm going to steal this show<br/>whether you like it or not!")
('Van', "C'mon, you guys...")
('Aaron', "I haven't been steeling my nerves all this time<br/>for nothing. I'm not letting anything get between me<br/>and my sweet, sweet revenge.")
('Aaron', "Even if you fire me, I'll just hitch a ride with<br/>Heiyue instead.")
('Feri', "And I'd try to join up with the Warriors of Kruga.")
('Feri', 'I would really rather go with everyone here, though.')
('Feri', 'I wanna tackle this thing head on—the spriggan way.')
('Van', '...!')
('Agnès', 'Naturally, I would like to accompany you as well.')
('Agnès', "Not just because of the Geneses—though I'll admit<br/>that is a factor.")
('Agnès', "More importantly, I feel this conflict is born from the<br/>source of Calvard's turmoil—the distortions in the<br/>everyday world I know and the underworld.")
('Agnès', 'If my feeling is correct, then I want—no, must see<br/>this through to its conclusion.')
('Agnès', 'I recognize this may be a harrowing experience for<br/>me, but even so, I am determined to confront the<br/>harsh realities that lie in wait.')
('Agnès', 'So take me with you, Van. Please.')
('Quatre', 'Agnès...')
('Judith', '(Wow...)')
('Risette', '...')
('Van', "*sigh* Somehow I knew it'd end up like this one way<br/>or another.")
('Van', "Unlucky for you, though, the trouble isn't happening<br/>on a weekend or during a school trip. You're gonna<br/>have to play hooky.")
('Agnès', "I know, and I do feel guilty about it. Still, I have a<br/>plan in mind, so don't worry.")
('Van', "Startin' to think I'm a bad influence.")
('Van', "I'll make sure you get paid in advance. That way,<br/>you'll have the mira for the bribes and hush money.")
('Agnès', "I-I wasn't planning on going THAT far!")
('Feri', 'Heehee.')
('Quatre', "Wow. Van's right. He really IS a bad influence<br/>on you.")
('Aaron', "Okay, then. Now that we've got all that squared away,<br/>mind sharing the location of the base?")
('Judith', 'Right. We need to know where they are so we can<br/>kick their sorry butts.')
('Bergard', 'Heh. Very well, then.')
('Bergard', 'Their base of operations is located in the third-largest<br/>city in the Republic, as well as its oldest.')
('Bergard', 'It is also the place where the terrorists of Calvard get<br/>much of their funding.')
('Bergard', 'The old city capital: Oración.')
('Bergard', 'That is where they have set the stage for their carnival<br/>of chaos.')
(500, 'November 20th, 1208, 5:35AM')
('Agnès', "It really is a shame we can't take Marielle with us.")
('Feri', "At least she's going there with the guild. Better than<br/>traveling on her own.")
('Van', "Yeah. Sounds like they're planning to send a lot of<br/>people over to Oración.")
('Van', "Can't think of a better group for the job.")
('Bergard', 'Indeed. Helping civilians is what they do best.')
('Aaron', "Heh. Meanwhile, we're only going to avenge that<br/>handsome reporter guy.")
('Quatre', 'Were you able to get the matter settled with your<br/>school, Agnès?')
('Agnès', 'Yes. I told them yesterday I would be absent for a few<br/>days due to a family emergency.')
('Agnès', "They've always been very accommodating of my<br/>family...situation.")
('Agnès', "Although, I've never taken advantage of it like this...")
('Quatre', "I don't think anyone can blame you, given<br/>the circumstances.")
('Aaron', "It's still a black mark on your spotless record, though.<br/>Miss Perfect's gonna turn into Miss Delinquent<br/>before we know it.")
('Feri', "As long as she doesn't sink to Van's level, she'll<br/>be fine!")
('Van', 'I am literally standing right here.')
('Judith', "You guys sure love to bicker, don't you?")
('Risette', 'What of Ms. Bright and your other friends? Have you<br/>informed them?')
('Agnès', "Renne already knows. She's going to be helping the<br/>guild on this mission.")
('Agnès', "She already left last night, so I expect we'll run into<br/>her in Oración.")
('Van', "Makes sense. Guessin' she had to take some time off,<br/>too, then?")
('Agnès', 'Yes. She told the school she received an emergency<br/>request to return home from the Liberlian embassy.')
('Agnès', "I didn't get a chance to fill in Odette and Albert on<br/>what's been happening, though.")
('Agnès', "I'll make it a point to apologize to them when we<br/>get back.")
('Van', 'Sounds like a plan.')
('Van', "Mornin', y'all. Sorry you two had to get up so early on<br/>our account.")
('Victor', 'Hmph. We have to get the bistro ready for<br/>business, anyway. ...Though tell me, why is the actress<br/>going with you?')
('Judith', "O-Oh, I'm, uh, going with them to...assess the<br/>location for my next film. Yeah, that's it.")
('Paulette', 'I hope that goes well, then.')
('Paulette', '*sigh* I was hoping Yumé would be able to get up and<br/>see you off, but it was just too early for her.')
('Van', "We'll buy her a souvenir or two while we're out, so<br/>tell her to look forward to 'em.")
('Paulette', "Of course. I'll do just that.")
('Paulette', "I'm almost scared to ask why you have to leave for<br/>Oración of all places—especially at a time like this...")
('Paulette', "...but remember, I'm holding you to your promise<br/>about that souvenir.")
('Victor', 'Take good care of your people, you<br/>troublemaking buffoon.')
('Victor', "If you don't—if even one of 'em gets hurt—I'm<br/>doubling the rent on your office.")
('Van', "Ouch. You aren't pullin' your punches, are you?<br/>Well, I'll do what I can to keep 'em safe.")
('Feri', "We'll pick the best souvenir money can buy. It'll put a<br/>big smile on Yumé's face. Guaranteed!")
('Victor', "...We have not known each other for long, Mr.<br/>Zeman, but I can tell you're no ordinary traveler.")
('Victor', 'Please make sure my tenants come back safe<br/>and sound.')
('Bergard', "Of course. That's what I'm here for.")
('Bergard', "In return, why don't we go for another round of chess<br/>when I get back? And I would not be opposed to<br/>having more of that heavenly food of yours, too.")
('Victor', 'Haha. Nothing would make me happier—especially<br/>since our game last night ended in a draw.')
('System', 'It had been eight days since the events of Oración<br/>came to a close.')
('System', "After the crisis was resolved, it was announced that<br/>the explosion at Vashtar Palace and Creil's<br/>destruction were the work of Almata.")
('System', 'However, as if to quell any unease, it was also<br/>promptly announced that Almata was no more thanks<br/>to the CID and a number of external collaborators.')
('System', 'With the last remaining nuclear device being<br/>recovered, the state of emergency around Edith was<br/>lifted the next day.')
('System', 'This happened in tandem with fervent reports that<br/>the CEOs of the Quincy Company and ETWS had<br/>been formally arrested.')
('System', "This was a shock to many. The Quincy Company's<br/>products were beloved across the continent, and<br/>ETWS vehicles seen as a major status symbol.")
('System', 'It was almost unfathomable that both men had been<br/>blackmailed into funding a terrorist organization.')
('System', "The Quincy Company's CEO being the father of a<br/>famous A-rank bracer added to much of the<br/>discussion as well.")
('System', "However, as his daughter personally led the charge on<br/>his arrest, the general public's sentiment was one of<br/>compassion and concern...")
('System', "...and her attempt to turn in her bracer badge was<br/>summarily rejected by the guild's headquarters<br/>in Leman.")
('System', "Calvard's economy, which had been briefly thrown<br/>into disarray by the state of emergency, was quick to<br/>return to relative normality.")
('System', 'Yet some things would never return—the impending<br/>end of reparations continued to emit a small degree of<br/>unease among the populace.')
('System', "Still, this and the culmination of events had no ill<br/>effect on President Gramheart's approval rating.<br/>Indeed, they only served to increase it.")
('System', "His office stated that a memorial service for Creil<br/>would be held during December 3rd's Revolution<br/>Festival. Following that would be quite the reveal:")
('System', "The Calvard military's newest weapon would be on<br/>display—a symbol of the country overcoming its grief<br/>and moving forward with great strength.")
(500, 'November 30th, 1208 9:12AM')
('Judith', "So that's that, huh?")
('Van', "Yeah. Melchior's still on the run, which does<br/>bug me...")
('Van', '...but the authorities and the guild have taken out all<br/>their bases and secured any routes that could be used<br/>to flee the country.')
('Van', 'Their partners in crime are being taken care of,<br/>too, right?')
('Bergard', 'Indeed. The Gralsritter and Iscariot have put aside<br/>their differences for now to pursue the Gardens.')
('Bergard', 'Several jaegers, including those of Ikaruga, and even<br/>the society have also been working toward that end.')
('Risette', "Meanwhile, Heiyue and Marduk spearheaded the<br/>effort to expose all of Almata's connections.")
('Risette', 'I believe their findings, which reveal a number of<br/>associates, have since been sold to the CID.')
('Agnès', "That's quite a lot...")
('Aaron', 'Man, Gien and Cao never miss a beat.')
('Feri', 'Abi and the rest of our people have been hard at work<br/>with Eisenschild, too.')
('Quatre', "As for the nuclear weapon, we don't need to worry<br/>about that, either.")
('Quatre', "Professor Hamilton and the other disciples supervised<br/>its disassembly, so it's no longer a threat.")
('Quatre', "Professor Callaghan isn't believed to have made any<br/>more, and the mafia won't be capable of making more<br/>themselves any time soon.")
('Bergard', 'Even if the one sword capable of detonating them<br/>was still in their possession, they would still need a<br/>device to BE detonated.')
('Bergard', 'I might add that Calvard is aiding the Congregation<br/>for the Sacraments in going through and clearing the<br/>rubble that was once Vashtar Palace.')
('Bergard', 'They expect to have finished the task and found that<br/>sword, together with the halberd and armor artifacts,<br/>by mid-next month.')
('Judith', 'None of them can be used by anyone but their<br/>rightful owner anyway, right?')
('Judith', "*sigh* I guess once that's wrapped up, we'll be able to<br/>say this whole thing's well and truly over.")
('Agnès', "I suppose so, yes. To think we've persevered through<br/>so much...")
('Van', '...We sure have.')
('Feri', "I'm still worried about Melchior, though.")
('Feri', "Just to me, it's strange how no one seems to have any<br/>idea where he is.")
('Judith', "I still can't believe what he did to his own boss...")
('Judith', "I don't know if I'll ever be able to understand how<br/>that guy thinks. Not that I want to.")
('Aaron', 'Psychopath does psychopathic things, news at 11.<br/>Just how it is.')
('Aaron', "I wish I could've taken revenge on the last asshole<br/>responsible for my bros' deaths, but can't win 'em all,<br/>I guess.")
('Van', "Yeah. We're gonna have to leave that one to the<br/>Oathbreaker's people.")
('Van', "They say you gotta fight poison with poison—now<br/>it's time to see if he'll live up to that old saying.")
('Agnès', 'Right. But at least now, the world can finally be<br/>at ease.')
('Van', '...')
('Feri', 'Agnès...')
('Judith', "Are you still feeling guilty that you couldn't stop it all<br/>from happening?")
('Agnès', "I am, but I'm also trying to tell myself that I did<br/>everything that I could.")
('Agnès', 'Including for the children of Oración.')
('Agnès', "Even if I can't help but feel like I put a lot of people<br/>out for nothing.")
('Quatre', "That's not true at all!")
('Risette', 'Perhaps there may be some who would see your<br/>actions as self-righteous, but I believe they<br/>were meaningful.')
('Van', "Course they were. And I'm not in the business of<br/>telling my assistants what's right and wrong, either.")
('Van', "You did what you believed was right. That's good<br/>enough for me.")
('Van', 'So you got my thanks, too.')
('Agnès', "Well, you're welcome, but I couldn't have done any of<br/>it without a lot of help from others.")
('Agnès', "Not everything had a happy conclusion, since Elaine's<br/>father ended up arrested...")
('Agnès', "Not everything had a happy conclusion, since Elaine's<br/>father ended up in a coma...")
('Agnès', "...but I'm still so glad that we're all able to gather like<br/>this again.")
('Van', 'Yeah.')
('Feri', 'Me, too!')
('Risette', "Our foes were a terrifying force to be reckoned with,<br/>but through everyone's cooperation, we triumphed.")
('Judith', "You deserve a lot of praise yourself, you know.<br/>Thinking back, there were a lot of times when I don't<br/>know what we would've done without you.")
('Judith', "We owe so much to the Goddess...or maybe to our<br/>chief having the devil's own luck?")
('Aaron', 'Heh. Could be.')
('Aaron', "Either that or 'cause I made Lady Luck my bitch.")
('Feri', 'What does that mean?')
('Quatre', "Will you stop that?! You really can't help yourself,<br/>can you?")
('Van', '*sigh*')
('Bergard', 'Haha...')
('Agnès', 'So we now have six Geneses in our possession.')
('Agnès', 'I doubt I could have ever gotten this far without all of<br/>you, so...thank you.')
('Feri', 'Aww. We were happy to help! That just leaves two<br/>now, though, right?')
('Quatre', 'There are supposed to be eight in all, so that should<br/>be the case.')
('Quatre', "Professor Hamilton has been looking into where they<br/>could be, but nothing's come up so far.")
('Risette', "None have been discovered in any of Almata's bases<br/>or the Gardens' hideouts, either.")
('Van', "I'm sure they'll turn up eventually. Just gotta<br/>keep lookin'.")
('Van', "So, now that we've dealt with Almata, things should<br/>be back to business as usual before long.")
('Van', "There's still gonna be plenty on our plates, especially<br/>in the short term...")
('Van', "...but it's about time you guys started thinkin' about<br/>whether or not you wanna keep workin' here.")
('Feri', '...')
('Aaron', 'Hmph...')
('Agnès', 'Van...')
('Risette', 'I suppose it is getting to be that time... The way<br/>things are going, my primary task will be complete<br/>before much longer.')
('Quatre', "I've still got other things I want to do here in the<br/>capital, at least.")
('Judith', "And hey! I'm not even employed here!")
('Van', "Wasn't really talkin' to you, but since you seem so<br/>dead set against being here anyway, why not go<br/>home already?")
('Judith', 'Umm... Well...')
('Judith', 'I would, but the paparazzi are such a headache, and<br/>the food here is so good...')
('Van', "I get that they're a hassle, but come on—they have<br/>to've given up on your story by now.")
('Van', "And Nina seems worried about you, so even if you<br/>don't go see your family, you should still go back to<br/>your old place.")
('Judith', 'I-I will—EVENTUALLY! What are you,<br/>my mother?!')
('Agnès', 'Perhaps you should discuss the situation with the<br/>owner of your apartment?')
('Van', "I WAS talkin' to you, though.")
('Agnès', '...What?')
('Van', "There's still coverin' all the trouble Almata caused,<br/>but I doubt that'll last more than a month.")
('Van', "So unless I start takin' on more subcontracted jobs,<br/>I'm not gonna need to pay out for any assistants<br/>anymore—or have the budget to do it.")
('Feri', 'Van...')
('Agnès', 'B-But...')
('Van', "I plan to find those last two Geneses, but it's gotta<br/>be on the side while I do other work from here on.")
('Van', "So while a helpin' hand when I'm swamped would be<br/>nice, it's all I'm gonna need you for.")
('Van', "'Sides, you're gonna be loaded up with Student<br/>Council work for a good while after next month<br/>rolls around.")
('Agnès', "That's...true, but...")
('Quatre', 'What kind of work?')
('Feri', "Oh, umm... There's going to be some big event<br/>taking place at Agnès' school in a few months.")
('Bergard', "There's no need to hurry them into a decision.")
('Bergard', "As you said, you still intend to help deal with the<br/>aftermath of Almata's actions.")
('Bergard', 'I will remain here to assist you with that as well—and<br/>the more we have on our side, the better.')
('Van', "You're not wrong there.")
('Van', "I just wanted to give you guys a heads up that you<br/>should be thinkin' about this stuff.")
('Van', "The Revolution Festival's in three days, and we're<br/>gonna be drownin' in work until then for sure.")
('Van', "Been a while since we could focus on 4SPGs in<br/>Edith, so hope you're ready to dive in soon as<br/>breakfast is done.")
('Van', "I'll meet you guys back here at half-past ten.<br/>What're you gonna be up to in the meantime, Agnès?")
('Agnès', 'Oh, not much. I do have something that I need to<br/>do, though...')
('Quatre', 'I think I should take care of a software update that<br/>needs installing now, actually.')
('Risette', 'Version 3.6.2 of the Kitty Engine that was released<br/>last night? I was thinking the same thing.')
('Feri', "Umm... I'll just get going for now, then.")
('Bergard', 'Until later.')
('Van', 'So she pushed an update, huh? Our ex-Kitty sure<br/>keeps herself busy.')
('Van', "And I just know her workload in Oración must've<br/>been nuts, too.")
('Van', '(...This is for the best, I think.)')
('Mare', 'Yeah, yeah. Just tell me what you want.')
('Van', "(She hasn't done anything out of the ordinary<br/>since Oración.)")
('Van', "(There's still a lot of mysteries to be solved about both<br/>her and the Grendel...)")
('Van', "(...but those've got nothin' to do with the others—not<br/>even Agnès.)")
('Mare', 'No... This is all wrong...')
('Mare', "This isn't who I am! This isn't me!")
('Dantès', 'Haha. I was right all along...')
('Dantès', 'I found it... Seems my work here is now done...')
('Van', '...Still, maybe Master was right that I laid that on<br/>them outta nowhere.')
('Van', "There's still time until we need to head out.<br/>Why don't I go check on 'em?")
('Feri', '...')
('Van', 'Are those Central Eastern and Western<br/>history textbooks?')
('Feri', 'Oh! Yeah. Agnès gave me the Western one.')
('Feri', "They're supposed to be the same edition, but there's a<br/>bunch of little differences between their contents<br/>and viewpoints.")
('Feri', "It's been really eye-opening comparing them—even if<br/>there's also lots of stuff I don't really understand.")
('Van', "Well, ain't you a budding scholar? If you can get your<br/>hands on the Far Eastern version, I bet you'd find all<br/>kinds of differences there, too.")
('Feri', 'Heehee. I was thinking the same thing, so Aaron<br/>promised to give me his old copy.')
('Feri', 'You know, before I met you, I barely left the village.<br/>Most of my life was spent inside of it.')
('Feri', "But Aida wasn't kidding when she talked about how<br/>big the outside world is.")
('Feri', 'Even if I dedicated my entire life to studying, I doubt<br/>I could learn all there is to know about it.')
('Van', '...Probably, yeah.')
('Van', "Listen: I meant what I said earlier, but I probably<br/>shouldn't have brought it up outta nowhere the way<br/>I did.")
('Feri', "N-No, I totally get where you're coming from!")
('Feri', "The timing is right. Now that Almata's gone, I feel<br/>like I've been able to avenge Aida's death.")
('Feri', "It sounds like Abi's willing to forgive me for<br/>disobeying his orders, too.")
('Feri', 'I also miss Umi—my mom—and my siblings Lana<br/>and Camil, to tell you the truth.')
('Feri', "But...I've also gotten used to living in Calvard, and I<br/>have a lot of fun at Sunday School...")
('Feri', "...and more than anything else, I'd be really sad to say<br/>goodbye to you and everyone here.")
('Van', '...Haha.')
('Van', "Still, we're not talkin' about tomorrow or even next<br/>week—and even if you do go home it's not like we'll<br/>never see each other again.")
('Van', 'If your goal is to become a real warrior, though, then<br/>I think the choice is clear.')
('Feri', "I guess you're right...")
('Van', "Though you don't have to go down that path if you<br/>don't want to. There's plenty of things you could do<br/>off the battlefield.")
('Van', "You could even try followin' a path more<br/>like Sylphid's.")
('Feri', 'You really think I could be like Fie?')
('Van', "I'm not pushin' you to join the guild or anything, to<br/>be clear.")
('Van', "Just sayin' it might be better than you followin' in<br/>your brother's footsteps...")
('Feri', 'Y-Yeah. I think so, too.')
('Feri', 'Still, I never even considered becoming a bracer...')
('Feri', 'I-Is it okay if I think more about it?')
('Van', "Think about it as long as you want—there's no rush.<br/>And just be ready to head out in a bit, okay?")
('Feri', 'Okay!')
('Aaron', '*humming* ♪')
('Van', "Honestly kinda nice to have you still actin' the same<br/>around times like these.")
('Aaron', 'What? You come to talk about that cold bunk you<br/>said to the kiddos?')
('Aaron', "If it was gonna eat away at you, you shouldn't have<br/>said it in the first place. Looks lame when a dad past<br/>his prime sulks over his teenage kids.")
('Van', "Quit findin' ways to call me old!")
('Van', "'Sides, you seem to have it in your head I wasn't<br/>talkin' to you, but I was.")
('Van', 'You gotta have plans to go back home<br/>eventually, right?')
('Aaron', "Sure do. I'm a born and bred Langport boy, and I<br/>always will be.")
('Aaron', "But I've only been here for three months.<br/>That's barely enough time to miss me.")
('Aaron', "So unless I've got some specific reason to head back,<br/>I'm staying put.")
('Aaron', "But I wouldn't mind going to a few other places, like<br/>Crossbell or Erebonia.")
('Aaron', "Hell, I'd even put eastern Zemuria on the table.")
('Van', 'Heh. Look at you go.')
('Aaron', "Knock it off with the 'my baby's growin' up' vibe.")
('Aaron', "Oh, and let's get one thing straight: me staying in the<br/>capital doesn't mean I'm gonna be at your beck<br/>and call.")
('Aaron', "If the girls left and this place turned into a total<br/>sausage fest...I don't even wanna think about how sad<br/>a sight that'd be.")
('Van', "Hey, don't give me that look! I'm not after your pity,<br/>all right?")
('Van', "By the way...your old problem ain't shown any sign<br/>of resurfacing, right?")
('Aaron', 'You mean that Tyrant?')
('Aaron', "Yeah, nothing there. Gien can call me a reincarnation<br/>all he wants, but as far as I'm concerned, I'm as me as<br/>I can be.")
('Aaron', 'I decide what I wanna do with my life—not some<br/>dusty old relic from the ancient past.')
('Van', "Heh... You're a one-of-a-kind cocky little bastard,<br/>you know that?")
('Aaron', "And what's that supposed to mean? Don't be such a<br/>freakin' creep.")
('Aaron', 'Anyway, get lost so I can have my fun.')
('Aaron', "Though if you don't mind waiting to kick some ass<br/>on the clock, that'll give me time to go tap some ass<br/>off the clock.")
('Van', "We ain't puttin' off work for THAT! Just how much<br/>have you been getting around when I haven't<br/>been lookin'?!")
('Risette', '...')
('Van', '(Must be working on stuff for Marduk.<br/>Probably about Almata.)')
('Van', "(There's still a decent chunk of time until half past, so<br/>I'd better get out of her hair.)")
('Risette', 'Phew... Oh, Mr. Arkride!')
('Van', "Sorry. I wouldn't have come in if I'd known you<br/>were working.")
('Van', 'All the Almata stuff almost wrapped up?')
('Risette', "Yes. We've been able to pinpoint groups related to<br/>them, their dummy corporations, and other<br/>illegal channels.")
('Risette', 'I admit to some surprise at just how far outside of<br/>Calvard their reach spreads...')
('Risette', '...but Marduk has largely decontaminated the areas<br/>over which it has influence.')
('Van', "Your chief of security had a big role to play in that,<br/>too, I'm sure.")
('Van', "Though who wants to bet Thorndyke'll use this as a<br/>chance to expand Marduk's market share?")
('Risette', 'Heehee. I suspect you would be on the winning side<br/>of that bet.')
('Risette', 'Between the war against the Empire and the tower in<br/>Crossbell appearing soon after, it feels like too much<br/>is happening too fast in Zemuria.')
('Risette', 'As other countries seek to catch up with the Republic<br/>and its latest innovations—Xiphas, Assault Frames...')
('Risette', "...I imagine the need for Marduk's services will only<br/>expand going forward.")
('Van', "Makes it abundantly clear we're livin' in a time of<br/>big change.")
('Van', "And speaking of, you started thinkin' of the next step<br/>for yourself at all?")
('Risette', 'I am but a humble concierge. Nothing more,<br/>nothing less.')
('Risette', 'My focus for the foreseeable future remains in<br/>supporting you, Mr. Arkride—be that with Mare or<br/>with your stun caliber.')
('Risette', 'I could do most of my work remotely as I did before,<br/>of course, but I am now aware of just how much more<br/>inefficient that is.')
('Van', "Got'cha. Sure wish I knew why your people love to<br/>have their eye on me so damn much...")
('Van', "...but I ain't gonna tell you what to do. We got an<br/>equal deal goin' on between us.")
('Van', "Just keep in mind that starting next month, I'm not<br/>gonna need as much office help as I have been.")
('Van', "Which is probably fine for you. Your plate's full<br/>enough without dealin' with the day-to-day<br/>around here.")
('Risette', "Well, I suppose I do—though I would like to believe<br/>I'm making a fair contribution irrespective of that.")
('Risette', '...')
('Van', "Somethin' up?")
('Risette', "It's nothing, really...")
('Risette', 'I was only thinking that I might not be able to help<br/>you from next month onward after all.')
('Risette', "You see, next month will mark one year since I was<br/>given this body, and it's about time it was given some<br/>thorough maintenance.")
('Van', 'Oh. Right...')
('Risette', "Depending on matters here and the overall project's<br/>status, I might have to return to my<br/>former environment.")
('Risette', 'In that event, I would have no choice but to revert to<br/>assisting you remot—')
('Van', 'Now hold up there.')
('Van', 'You really gonna be okay with that?')
('Risette', 'So you have an inkling as to what that former<br/>environment was.')
('Risette', "What gave it away? Was it something about the way<br/>I work? ...No, I suppose there isn't any point in<br/>me knowing.")
('Van', "Nah, it wasn't anything like that. Just...")
('Risette', "Please, don't misunderstand.")
('Risette', "As you're aware, Marduk is a logical,<br/>impartial corporation.")
('Risette', "So long as I keep demonstrating I can provide value<br/>to them, I don't doubt they will keep letting me use<br/>this body.")
('Risette', 'In that regard, our relationship is quite equitable.<br/>I even plan to purchase it from them if all goes well.')
('Van', "Huh. That's an option?")
('Van', "A state-of-the-art artificial body can't run<br/>cheap, though.")
('Risette', "It most certainly is costly, but with my salary, I think<br/>it's possible that I could have enough mira saved in a<br/>few years.")
('Risette', 'My current arrangement here earns me even more<br/>than my remote work did, too, so I would like to keep<br/>at it as long as possible.')
('Van', 'Hey, happy to help.')
('Van', "...So I'm curious. Just how high a salary are we<br/>talkin', anyway?")
('Risette', "Well, I can't give you a specific number, since that's<br/>classified information...")
('Risette', '...but about enough to buy an ETWS<br/>entry-level sedan?')
('Van', 'You could buy a used apartment in the suburbs with<br/>that kinda money!')
('FIO', 'Hello, Van.')
('Quatre', 'Oh, is it time to go already?')
('Van', "You still got time, don't worry. But damn, your drone<br/>is somethin'.")
('Van', "Their speech is stiffer than a holo's, but it's wild how<br/>you can hold a whole conversation with them.")
('Quatre', "Yeah. They don't have complete free will, but they do<br/>have a networked sense of self.")
('Quatre', "XEROS is the same. They're around the same quality<br/>as those combat shells in the Empire, from what<br/>I understand.")
('Quatre', "The other Mare is leagues ahead of them on a<br/>technical scale, but Aidios knows how long it'll take<br/>humanity to make something similar.")
('Van', "That'd be a tough ask even for Hamilton and<br/>Cronkite, huh?")
('Quatre', "Oh, absolutely. We're talking singularities here.")
('Quatre', "Still, we know it's theoretically possible. That was<br/>proven by what happened behind the scenes two<br/>years ago.")
('Quatre', "You've heard all about that, I assume?")
('Van', 'A bit, yeah.')
('Van', "I guess I don't even need to ask what you're gonna do<br/>once you graduate?")
('Van', "Feels like a given that you'll be focusing on orbal<br/>drone research. Or have you got your sights set<br/>even higher?")
('Quatre', "Haha. I'd like to help the professor with her work at<br/>some point, even if I don't feel like I'm quite<br/>ready yet.")
('Quatre', "Still, I'd rather finish things here before moving on to<br/>something else.")
('Quatre', 'Working here has been incredible for broadening my<br/>horizons, too, so I think continuing my studies here<br/>would be more than worth its while.')
('Van', 'You think?')
('Quatre', 'Basel has patently more in the way of facilities, but<br/>the orbal network is lightning quick these days.')
('Quatre', "It's even helped me attend lectures at the institute<br/>remotely, so it hasn't been half as inconvenient as I<br/>was expecting.")
('Quatre', 'Being here will also let me take part in the project to<br/>upgrade the network currently in use in Edith and the<br/>surrounding area.')
('Quatre', "Though at some point, I'd really like to broaden my<br/>studies at the Epstein Foundation, ZCF,<br/>and Reinford.")
('Van', 'Makes sense.')
('Van', "Man, our little boy who could only think of protectin'<br/>his grandmother's home is all ready to take the world<br/>by storm.")
('Van', "With how grown up you are, you should've just joined<br/>us in the springs instead of bein' shy.")
('Quatre', 'Wha—?! Who are you, Aaron?!')
('Van', '...My bad. I only heard it after it came outta<br/>my mouth.')
('Van', "But yeah. Compared to the others, it hasn't been long<br/>since you moved in.")
('Van', "If you're satisfied with the setup you got goin' on<br/>here, I don't see the harm in working from here for a<br/>while longer.")
('Van', "Plus you got Paulette to breathe down your neck if<br/>your health starts to nosedive from researchin'<br/>all night.")
('Quatre', "Haha. You're probably right—it's nice how she<br/>always worries.")
('Quatre', "Still, are you sure you aren't going to need my help<br/>after this month?")
('Quatre', 'Almata might be out of the picture, but the issue of<br/>the Geneses is still ongoing...')
('Quatre', "...and there's still a lot we don't know about Mare, the<br/>Grendel, or Marduk, either.")
('Quatre', "Then there's whatever Yang—Professor Cronkite—is<br/>working on with the president...")
('Van', "You got a point. There's a lot goin' on.")
('Van', "So if I need help with stuff, I'll be sure to<br/>come knockin'. That means you come knockin' if you<br/>need help with stuff, too.")
('Van', "I can investigate whatever you want—even down to<br/>the color of Cronkite's underwear.")
('Quatre', "Ahaha. That's so random—and don't think I didn't<br/>notice you patting me on the head!")
('FIO', "You've become very red, Quatre.")
('Van', 'You catch a cold? Let me feel—')
('Quatre', 'My temperature is perfectly normal, thank you<br/>very much!')
('Nina', "So you're going back to your apartment?")
('Judith', "Yeeeah, I guess that's the plan. I must've worried you<br/>sick, huh?")
('Judith', "It looks like Buzzraider's finally given up on their<br/>stupid obsession with me, so it seems safe enough to<br/>live there again.")
('Nina', "There's been so much going on lately that I'm sure<br/>they've got bigger fish to fry now...")
('Nina', '...Hmm?')
('Van', "Sorry. Didn't mean to interrupt.")
('Nina', "Oh, you're fine! I've actually been wanting to thank<br/>you for helping out Judith for a while now.")
('Nina', 'Please pass on my regards to everyone else as well,<br/>including the family who runs the bistro.')
('Judith', "N-Now hold your horses! I'm the one who's been<br/>helping HIM out, so why's he the one<br/>getting thanked?!")
('Nina', "Because I'm sure that you just weaseled your way into<br/>his trips outside the capital without taking no for<br/>an answer.")
('Nina', "I don't know all you've been up to, but I do know that<br/>you were able to return in one piece thanks to Arkride<br/>Solutions' efforts.")
('Nina', "And with how much I respect you as my senior in the<br/>industry, I think it's only natural for me to want to say<br/>thank you.")
('Judith', "So you respect me that much, huh...? I-I mean, not<br/>that it isn't perfectly natural for you to respect me,<br/>of course!")
('Van', "(Never takes much to butter her up...though I'm sure<br/>our young lady here just so happens to be an expert<br/>at it.)")
('Judith', "She's become such a sassy little thing...")
('Judith', 'She was so cute and polite when she first started out,<br/>but look at her now. All that success must be<br/>going to her head.')
('Van', 'That was three years ago, right?')
('Van', "Though I dunno if fifteen's early or late for startin'<br/>out in your industry.")
('Judith', "It's not late, but it's not really early, either. I started<br/>acting at fourteen, myself.")
('Judith', "A lot of actors and actresses get their first roles when<br/>they're children, even, which just goes to show how<br/>much of an unusual case she is.")
('Judith', 'She ended up going from a rookie to a top actress in<br/>three years, which is just...crazy.')
('Van', "I can see why, though. I've seen a few of her films,<br/>and it's interestin' seeing how different her approach<br/>to the craft is compared to yours.")
('Van', "You can handle any kind of role that's thrown at you,<br/>yeah, but she just...fully becomes the character she's<br/>playing without even trying.")
('Judith', "I didn't realize you knew your way around different<br/>acting techniques. I agree with you, too.")
('Judith', "Her performance in Wolves' Requiem was amazing,<br/>but Gloria just blew me away...")
('Van', "Yeah. Her as Sheena Dirke was somethin' else.")
('Van', 'The media kicked up all that fuss about an Easterner<br/>playing the role, but in the end it was hard to see her<br/>as anything other than Sheena reborn.')
('Judith', "Boy... She's four years my junior, and already, she's<br/>nipping at my heels. She's sure not making it easy to<br/>stay top dog...")
('Judith', "...but I say bring it on. I don't plan to go down<br/>without a fight!")
('Van', "Good. I got nothin' but respect for that spunk you got<br/>in you.")
('Van', "Real shame 'bout the rest of you, though.")
('Judith', 'You better watch your darn mouth!')
('Judith', "And while I'm at it—I think what you said earlier was<br/>pretty out of line, too.")
('Van', 'Uhh... Right.')
('Van', "So, now that we've dealt with Almata, things should<br/>be back to business as usual before long.")
('Van', "But it's about time you guys started thinkin' about<br/>whether or not you wanna keep workin' here.")
('Van', '...Yeah. I think so, too.')
('Judith', "Wow. I didn't expect you to outright admit it. Then...")
('Van', "Still, you don't want people butting in on your side<br/>hustle, either, do you?")
('Judith', "W-Well, no, but that's not the same thing.")
('Judith', 'I inherited my techniques from my mom and hers<br/>before her, and while they might not be legal, I still<br/>think the world needs—')
('Judith', "...Oh. I get you now. I don't know what your secret<br/>is, but...")
('Judith', "...you've got something you don't want people to get<br/>involved in, too, huh?")
('Judith', "Or I guess...something you can't afford to let them<br/>get involved in.")
('Van', '...')
('Van', "Anyway, as two people who transform into things a<br/>teenager might've dreamed up, we gotta look out for<br/>each other.")
('Van', "Don't know if I'm down to get caught livin' with an<br/>actual criminal, though, so you should still probably<br/>find some other place to live.")
('Judith', "Erk...<br/>(But I really, really don't want to give this place up...)")
('Judith', "W-Well, I've got my next film's premiere coming up,<br/>so I'll go back to my old place before the festival,<br/>at least.")
('Judith', "*sigh* I just wish I didn't have a bunch of stuff to<br/>report to Mom and Grammy first...")
('Van', "Well, look who's made himself right at home.")
('Bergard', "As you well know, I shouldn't even be alive right now.")
('Bergard', "I have decided to make the most of this chance to try<br/>things I couldn't even imagine in my previous life—<br/>and have found myself rather enjoying them.")
('Bergard', "The magazines you used to read were quite<br/>inspirational, if I'm being honest.")
('Van', 'Wait, so this is my fault?!')
('Van', "(If his hordes of more respectable students ever found<br/>this out, they'd have my head...)")
('Van', "So Ashladd isn't the uncooperative jackass I<br/>was expecting?")
('Bergard', 'Indeed. He may be a man of few words, but he is an<br/>honorable, just, and determined one capable of seeing<br/>the greater picture.')
('Bergard', "Rank-and-file armed monks trust him, so I would be<br/>confident in Iscariot's handling of matters if he were<br/>the only one they answered to. However...")
('Van', "We got his boss to worry about—their<br/>'captain,' right?")
('Van', 'The one all 30,000 members of the Papal Guard and<br/>Iscariot answer to.')
('Bergard', "Correct. They took up their post after my retirement,<br/>so I've never met them.")
('Bergard', 'I believe their identity is considered a top secret even<br/>among the Congregation for Divine Worship, to<br/>whom the Papal Guard also answers.')
('Bergard', 'I suspect only a small number of people know who<br/>they are.')
('Bergard', 'Several hundred Iscariot monks, the cardinals of the<br/>Congregation for Divine Worship, the commander of<br/>the Gralsritter, and the Pope.')
('Bergard', "Whoever they are, they are without a doubt the<br/>congregation's wild card.")
('Van', 'But what reason would someone like that have to get<br/>their righthand man involved in this?')
('Van', "The Geneses? But they're more of a Gralsritter<br/>kinda deal...")
('Van', 'Actually, why are you even telling me all this stuff in<br/>the first place?')
('Van', "I'm already like a magnet for info I don't wanna know<br/>as it is.")
('Bergard', "Hahaha! It's far too late to be caring about such<br/>things, my young friend.")
('Bergard', 'Still, whether they are criminal or legal, your old<br/>friends or your assistants...')
('Bergard', '...I genuinely believe that the more people you know<br/>and interact with, the better.')
('Van', '...')
('Bergard', 'Who we meet shapes who we become.')
('Bergard', 'Be these relationships fortunate or foul, we are all the<br/>more human because of them. Surely the past five<br/>years have taught you this?')
('Van', 'Well, I just...')
('Van', "...Haha. People's natures just don't change easily,<br/>I guess.")
('Van', 'Having you in Oración was a huge help—as huge a<br/>help as it is having you here now.')
('Van', 'So I count this relationship among the fortunate ones,<br/>at least.')
('Van', "So keep stickin' around so the younger generation can<br/>kick back a bit, yeah?")
('Van', "I'd pay you as thanks, but I don't think you'd take<br/>the mira. Hmm...")
('Van', "At least let me get you somethin' even nicer than that<br/>jacket you've taken a liking to.")
('Van', "Anyway, we've still got plenty of time left, so I'll go<br/>ahead and leave you be. Take it easy, Master.")
('Bergard', 'There are things in life you cannot avert your<br/>eyes from no matter how hard you try.')
('Bergard', 'Whether you can realize that fundamental truth is<br/>down to you, Van.')
('Agnès', '... ♪')
('Van', '...')
('Agnès', 'Okay, that should do it.')
('Agnès', 'Oh, Van. Is it almost time to go?')
('Van', "It's getting there, but we still got some time.")
('Van', "I can't believe how lifelike this guy is.<br/>Professor Hamilton's students are somethin' else.")
('Agnès', "I was told there's more to him sleeping in the sun<br/>than just imitating dogs, too.")
('Agnès', "He can turn the sun's rays into orbal energy.")
('Van', "Makes sense. I remember that bein' one of the areas<br/>Professor Hamilton was researching.")
('Van', "Still, I know you've gotten real comfy around here<br/>over the past few months...")
('Van', "...but it's almost time to start plannin' the next school<br/>festival, ain't it? Isn't the Student Council gonna get<br/>real busy soon?")
('Agnès', "Haha... Yes, you're absolutely right. I'm starting to<br/>feel the pressure, to tell you the truth.")
('Agnès', "The end of April still feels like a long ways off now,<br/>but I know it'll be here before we know it.")
('Agnès', "I was able to attend last year's festival just after<br/>enrolling, and there was just so much to see and do<br/>over those three days.")
('Agnès', 'It was hard to believe that the whole event was<br/>planned and executed by students alone—even if<br/>quite a lot of them did take part.')
('Van', "Yeah. It's a staple of spring in the capital at this point,<br/>especially with how many people check it out.")
('Van', "And with your current president at the helm, I can<br/>see this upcoming one bein' a festival for the books.")
('Agnès', 'Aha...ha... The other Student Council members and I<br/>are a liiittle worried about that.')
('Agnès', 'So you did attend Aramis, then?')
('Agnès', 'Just like Elaine and Mr. Kincaid.')
('Van', 'Yeah.')
('Van', 'I dropped out not long after becoming a second-year<br/>student, though.')
('Van', 'Elaine and I were in the same year, while René was a<br/>third year.')
('Van', "The second he had the chance, René took on being<br/>Student Council president, 'cause of course he did.")
('Van', "And 'cause we'd known him for so long, we started<br/>helpin' out with Student Council work, too.")
('Van', 'Then Elaine stepped up and took the role of vice<br/>president once the former one decided to go abroad<br/>for a while...')
('Van', "So there you go—that's how the festival came to be<br/>under one man's merciless watch.")
('Agnès', 'Heehee. I see.')
('Agnès', 'Of course, after getting to know you so well, I can<br/>imagine that whatever you organized for it was<br/>anything but typical.')
('Van', '*whistle*')
('Agnès', "Ahaha! I'm sure Elaine was less than impressed<br/>with it...")
('Agnès', "...while Mr. Kincaid thought it would be funny and<br/>thoroughly approved even though he probably<br/>shouldn't have.")
('Van', "Heh. It's like you were right there with us.")
('Van', 'I still remember my first drink at the afterparty back<br/>then, too. Man, it was so good.')
('Van', "You know how much of a sweet tooth I've got, but<br/>not even the bitterness of the alcohol could keep me<br/>from crackin' a smile.")
('Agnès', 'I should have known. You were pushing the<br/>boundaries of legality even as a teenager...')
('Agnès', 'So the festival came to a close, and the Student<br/>Council elections were held in May.')
('Agnès', "That's when Elaine became the next president...and<br/>when you dropped out, I assume?")
('Van', '...!')
('Agnès', 'You did it without warning, too—without so much as<br/>a single discussion with anyone beforehand.')
('Agnès', 'So? How right am I?')
('Van', "...You sure you're not psychic? It's like you're in<br/>my head.")
('Agnès', 'Heehee. Well, I know the average school year at<br/>Aramis, so I just put two and two together after<br/>seeing the way you talk to them.')
('Agnès', 'That, and these last few months have also done<br/>wonders for my personal growth.')
('Agnès', 'I used to be this shy little girl who was afraid to leave<br/>her comfort zone...')
('Agnès', "Someone who couldn't even speak her mind to the<br/>one family member she wished she could the most.")
('Agnès', "But now, I feel like a whole new me. I can walk a<br/>little further and have learned to say what's in<br/>my heart.")
('Agnès', 'I have everyone here to thank for that—but most<br/>of all I have you to thank for that.')
('Van', '...')
('Van', "I thought divining my high school years was enough<br/>of a surprise, but you weren't done, huh?")
('Van', "At this rate, you're gonna have everyone runnin'<br/>around at your beck and call even more than Renne.")
('Agnès', "Oh, stop. I doubt that'll be the case.")
('Agnès', '(Though there is one person I wish would pay a bit<br/>more attention to me.)')
('Van', "...Hmm? What's up?")
('Agnès', 'Nothing. I was just thinking that I still have a long<br/>road ahead of me.')
('Van', '...?')
('Van', "So you got to talk to him a bit on the phone after<br/>what happened in Oración, but that's it?")
('Agnès', "Yes...though I'm used to that by now.")
('Agnès', "It seems like this year's Revolution Festival is going to<br/>be a big one, too, what with the memorial service and<br/>more besides.")
('Agnès', "It's no wonder he doesn't have much time to dedicate<br/>to me right now.")
('Agnès', 'But he did say we could get together after the<br/>ceremony is over, thankfully.')
('Van', "Really? I guess that's better than nothing—and at<br/>least you can still see him.")
('Agnès', "That is true... Compared to Elaine, I'm<br/>very fortunate.")
('Agnès', "I can't even imagine what she must be<br/>going through...")
('Agnès', "She's amazing to have been able to do what she did—<br/>to make what must have been an excruciating<br/>decision—even if it was the right one.")
('Agnès', "I don't think there are many people who could have<br/>followed through on that, bracer or otherwise.")
('Agnès', "I hate that the hard times clearly aren't over for her...")
('Agnès', "I hate that the hard times clearly aren't over for her<br/>now that her dad is in a coma...")
('Agnès', '...but if you could just be there for her, I think she<br/>would like that very much.')
('Agnès', "I don't mean to put that responsibility squarely on<br/>your shoulders, of course! Mr. Kincaid and the guild<br/>should be there for her, too—but still!")
('Van', "I mean...yeah? I wasn't gonna give her the cold<br/>shoulder or anything.")
('Van', "It won't make up for what I did seven years ago, but<br/>I'd like to think I can be there for her in some way<br/>others can't.")
('Van', "Sounds like she won't be back here for a<br/>while, though. She's got a ton left to do in Oración.")
('Agnès', '...')
('Van', "What's that look for? Not proactive enough,<br/>you think?")
('Agnès', "Oh, don't mind me. I'm sure just knowing you want<br/>to comfort her would mean a lot in itself. Really!")
('Van', "O-Oh, okay...<br/>(Yeesh. Can't always please a teenager once they get<br/>to that age, I guess.)")
('Van', '(Still...)<br/>Haha...')
('Agnès', 'Wh-What is it? Why are you laughing?')
('Aaron', 'Heh. You lovebirds wanna get a room?')
('Agnès', "I-I didn't know you were all here! Is it already time to<br/>leave, then?")
('Van', "You might wanna get your eyes checked if you<br/>thought you were seein' heart eyes.")
('Quatre', "Oh, I don't know... Did you hear anything<br/>special, XEROS?")
('XEROS', 'RUFF?')
('Agnès', 'N-Not you, too, Quatre... We were just making<br/>small talk. Honest!')
('Feri', 'Heehee. I feel a little better now, to be honest.')
('Risette', 'Our futures may still be uncertain, but for now, we<br/>can continue to take each day as it comes.')
('Van', "That we can—and sorry. I shouldn't have said what I<br/>did earlier.")
('Agnès', 'Van...')
('Judith', 'Heh. Our boss is such a little troublemaker.')
('Aaron', "Don't sweat it. They say not being able to read the<br/>room comes with old age.")
('Van', "You know...one day you're gonna realize I'm still in<br/>my prime!")
('Quatre', "It's always the same with you two...")
('Bergard', 'Heh heh...')
('Van', "Forget it... Let's just see what's on the docket<br/>for today.")
('Van', "The Revolution Festival's three days out, and I<br/>wouldn't be surprised if the aftermath of Almata's<br/>destruction led to problems, too.")
('Van', "It's only half-past ten, and there's a lot of us, so I<br/>think we can cover all the districts in this part of town<br/>by today, right?")
('Feri', 'Right!')
('Agnès', "Then let's get to work!")
('System', 'Agnès, Feri, and Aaron have joined the party.<br/>Select two additional members.')
(500, 'November 30th, 4:55PM')
('System', "Upon hearing of their plans, Montmart's owners<br/>graciously allowed them an exclusive run of the bistro<br/>until 7PM.")
('System', 'They then invited many of their friends and<br/>acquaintances to join them, amounting to a<br/>more than modest celebration.')
('System', "With Almata's reign of terror at an end, they were<br/>able to let go and truly enjoy the moment...")
('System', '...and despite most attendees rarely or never crossing<br/>paths, they opened up to each other in record time.')
('System', 'Even celebrities like Judith, Nina, and the crown<br/>prince fit right in with the evening of merriment and<br/>delicious food.')
('System', '(There were some who stepped over the line and<br/>ended up paying the price, but they only got what<br/>they deserved.)')
('Van', "I can't believe even Cao ended up comin'... This shit<br/>ended up being a crazier mess than I was countin' on.")
('Elaine', 'It is quite the mishmash of people—I never pictured<br/>Renne, the Gralsritter, and the crown prince to ever<br/>be in the same room.')
('Elaine', "If you tried to tell someone who wasn't here about<br/>this guest list, they'd think you were making it up.")
('Kincaid', 'Especially so with unscrupulous celebrities like Rixia<br/>Mao and Judith Lanster being here.')
('Kincaid', 'Since we do owe them, however, I see no reason to<br/>drive them out.')
('Van', "I got no comment on either of 'em—though Miss<br/>Vice President here might not be as up for lettin'<br/>some things slide.")
('Elaine', 'Just how far stuck in the past are you? If nothing else,<br/>dealing with the Twilight forced me to be a little<br/>more flexible with whom I work.')
('Elaine', 'And I certainly doubt you could have triumphed in<br/>Oración without the help of people from all sides of<br/>the moral spectrum.')
('Van', 'Sure doubt it.')
('Kincaid', "Realizing that you can't always keep it clean is a sign<br/>you have truly matured.")
('Kincaid', "I'd wondered if the two of you would ever grow up,<br/>but at last, I can breathe a sigh of relief.")
('Van', "Don't lump me in with her! /<br/>Don't lump me in with him!")
('Kincaid', "Haha... Or maybe you two haven't changed in<br/>the slightest.")
('Kincaid', "You're both exactly like you were in high school.")
('Van', "That goes double for you, then. You're still the same<br/>slave driver you've always been.")
('Van', 'Paid off, though. From Student Council president to<br/>counseling THE president.')
('Elaine', "To be sure. You've never been shy about your<br/>lofty ambitions.")
('Elaine', "What's the plan, then? Building a foothold in the<br/>CID, shooting through police bureaucracy, then<br/>finally landing in politics?")
('Kincaid', "I won't deny it. Skill and knowledge only have<br/>meaning when you use them, and I intend to<br/>use mine.")
('Kincaid', 'Of course, there are plenty of roads I could take to get<br/>into politics besides that one.')
('Van', "Here comes his boundless confidence. Not like he<br/>ain't got good reason for it, but ugh.")
('Elaine', 'I bet your chief must have a hard time working out<br/>what to do with you.')
('Kincaid', "Well, she's a smart woman. I don't doubt she sees<br/>right through me.")
('Kincaid', "...You've found yourself a fine base of operations,<br/>haven't you?")
('Kincaid', "It's almost a shame the actual work you do from here<br/>is as shady as it comes.")
('Elaine', 'It really is a nice place. Even your landlords<br/>are sweethearts.')
('Elaine', "I'm sure them being around has helped you achieve a<br/>balanced diet, too—even if it probably still contains<br/>far too much sugar.")
('Van', "Who are you, my mother? And if you think the work<br/>we're doin' here is shady, maybe stop pilin' more<br/>on us!")
('Van', "How're things with your dad, by the way?")
('Van', "I've heard he's at least cooperating with questioning.")
('Elaine', "He is. I've started seeing glimpses of the man he<br/>once was.")
('Elaine', 'I did plan to stay in Oración until a guilty verdict on<br/>his charges was reached...')
('Elaine', '...but my mother sent me away, saying she was sure I<br/>had something more important to do.')
('Van', "Last I heard, he still hadn't woken up.")
('Elaine', "That's all I know, too. Though we're lucky he's alive<br/>at all...")
('Elaine', "The doctors say there's still at least a chance that<br/>he'll recover.")
('Elaine', 'I did intend to stay with him a while longer, but my<br/>mother sent me away.')
('Van', 'I see...')
('Kincaid', 'Simone always was a strong woman—and it appears<br/>that she still is.')
('Kincaid', "Well, even if there's more to come, you must be<br/>feeling some relief that you have finally settled<br/>matters with him?")
('Elaine', 'I do. Half the reason I wanted to become a bracer was<br/>to clear my doubts about Father.')
('Elaine', "I hate how those doubts turned out to be justified, but<br/>even still, he'll always be family to me...")
('Elaine', "...and though it led me to being the one to charge<br/>him, I don't regret the path I chose.")
('Elaine', 'Now I can dedicate my days to mulling over what<br/>being a bracer really means to me.')
('Elaine', "It's time for me to consider my personal goals—to<br/>find how I can wield my sword for my sake.")
('Elaine', "It's like I can finally see things for what they truly are<br/>for the first time.")
('Kincaid', 'Heh.')
('Van', '...')
('Van', "Maybe you should try aimin' for that unofficial<br/>S-rank, then.")
('Van', 'You know you got the determination to work for it.')
('Elaine', "I don't know about that...or why you know about that<br/>rank, for that matter.")
('Elaine', 'But now that I have a clearer head, I feel like even<br/>A-rank is too high for me as I am.')
('Elaine', "Though since the higher ups rejected not only my<br/>resignation but my request for a rank decrease, I'll just<br/>have to make peace with it.")
('Van', 'You even asked for a demotion, huh? Damn, you<br/>really gotta learn to loosen up.')
('Van', 'Oh, yeah. You said that your dad was half the reason<br/>you became a bracer, right?')
('Van', 'What was the other half?')
('Elaine', '...What?')
('Van', "Like, uhh...did something happen at school between<br/>me droppin' out and graduation?")
('Elaine', 'You could say that, I suppose.')
('Elaine', 'But it has absolutely nothing to do with you. Not in<br/>the slightest.')
('Van', 'G-Got it...')
('Van', "(What's her deal? Did I screw up or somethin'?)")
('Kincaid', '(You do nothing BUT screw up with Elaine.)')
('Van', '(Me and my big mouth...)')
('Elaine', 'Stop whispering over me! Honestly, boys...')
('Elaine', "You know, I heard how the two of you had a whale of<br/>a time at your own little gathering following the<br/>school festival's afterparty.")
('Elaine', 'How disgraceful.')
('Van', "Look, just 'cause René brought his older girlfriend<br/>along doesn't mean we were lookin' to get<br/>into trouble!")
('Van', "We just wanted to drink some stuff our square of a<br/>vice prez would've had our heads over. We didn't<br/>have a choice but to leave you out.")
('Kincaid', "Though we certainly saw some stunning 'clientele' at<br/>that place my ex picked out, didn't we?")
('Van', "Don't tell her that!")
('Elaine', 'I-I knew it! I knew it!')
('Elaine', 'You supported me during the Student Council<br/>elections, but you were getting up to such debauchery<br/>behind the scenes...')
('Elaine', 'Then out of nowhere you just leave that letter and—')
('Elaine', "...I'm sorry. Bringing that up again is hitting below<br/>the belt, isn't it?")
('Van', 'Haha. In whose playbook?')
('Van', "'Sides, I'm the one who's in the wrong here.<br/>You don't need to apologize.")
('Elaine', 'Van...')
('Kincaid', '...')
('Elaine', "...If I'm allowed to stay on this subject, then, please at<br/>least answer one question for me.")
('Elaine', "Not why you left us behind—why you wouldn't let us<br/>help you.")
('Van', '...')
('Elaine', "I know we were at that age where we weren't quite<br/>adults, but we weren't children, either.")
('Elaine', "Maybe we couldn't have helped much even if<br/>we'd tried...")
('Elaine', "...but it's been seven years, and all of us are<br/>grown now.")
('Elaine', "And we're not the only ones who want to help you.<br/>All of your part-timers do, too, along with so<br/>many others.")
('Elaine', 'Is there nothing we can do? Can you still not rely<br/>on us?')
('Van', '...Sorry.')
('Elaine', '...!')
('Kincaid', 'Elaine.')
('Elaine', "...I know what you're going to say. I'm sorry, Van.<br/>I overstepped my boundaries there.")
('Van', "Like I said, I'm the one who's in the wrong. So<br/>you know...")
('Van', "...you're right to be mad at me—and honestly, it<br/>makes me kinda happy that you are.")
('Van', 'Thanks.')
('Elaine', '...')
('Elaine', '*sigh* You are so uncool.')
('Van', 'Yeah. No arguments here.')
('Kincaid', "It goes beyond uncool. It's almost painful to<br/>watch sometimes.")
('Kincaid', "You try your best to come across as apathetic about<br/>everything, but it's obvious as can be that you're<br/>faking it.")
('Elaine', "I agree. We bracers might get labeled something as<br/>embarrassing as 'allies of justice,' but you're the one<br/>acting more like a kid's idea of 'cool.'")
('Elaine', "Someone who's so soft that he can't bear to turn his<br/>back on anyone in need.")
('Kincaid', "Heh. Hit the nail on the head. You're softer than half<br/>the candy you eat and aren't even aware of it.")
('Van', "You guys can stop dunkin' on me anytime now!")
('Elaine', 'Heehee. Putting aside your uncool demeanor, then...')
('Elaine', '...you could probably stand to be a little more like the<br/>adult you are in front of your employees.')
('Van', '...?!')
('Feri', 'Ahaha...')
('Aaron', "Damn. Fun's over already?")
('Agnès', "W-We didn't mean to butt in... We just wanted to<br/>tell you that it was about time for the party to<br/>break up.")
('Quatre', "That doesn't really track with how hard you were<br/>trying not to be noticed...")
('Van', 'H-How long have you guys been there?')
('Risette', "Pardon us. We arrived roughly around when you<br/>said 'thanks.'")
('Judith', "You are so hopeless... You can sniff out just about<br/>anything, but you couldn't catch a whiff of us right<br/>around the corner?")
('Bergard', 'Heh.')
('Bracer Alvis', 'Elaine!')
('Zin the Immovable', "We're heading back to the branch now—what're you<br/>gonna do?")
('Fie', "We won't stop you if you were planning a little<br/>one-on-one time with your 'friend' there.")
('Elaine', "O-Of course I'm not! I'll come down and join you.")
('Kilika', "I'm planning to return to the office as well. Will you<br/>be accompanying me, Kincaid?")
('Kincaid', 'If I may. I will be right there.')
('Detective Nate', 'Aww... There were so many cute girls here I felt like I<br/>was clicking with, too...')
('Detective Nate', 'I can stay longer, right, sir?!')
('Inspector Daswani', 'Are you out of your mind? You have reports to write!')
('Director Gotti', 'I feel you, young man! I feel you so much it hurts!')
('Prince Sherid', "Honestly, I'm of the same mind—but it isn't right to<br/>deny the regulars of their bistro any longer.")
('Ashen', 'Thanks for inviting me, Van!')
('Rixia', 'I had a lot of fun here, too.')
('Cao', 'I am so very honored that you extended an invitation<br/>to my humble self as well.')
('Van', "We didn't! Why did you even come?!")
('Aaron', 'My bad. I just wanted the hot dancer, but he ended<br/>up tagging along.')
('Van', 'So it was YOUR fault!')
(500, 'November 30th, 7:51PM')
('Albert', "I still can't believe it... You really went to<br/>Aramis, then?")
('Van', 'Yeah, though I dropped out.')
('Odette', 'That stage performance you did when you were a<br/>student was bonkers!')
('Odette', 'Albert was almost starry-eyed when he was<br/>watching it. He started going on about how we had to<br/>do something at LEAST as goo—')
('Albert', 'I-I was not and I did not!')
('Agnès', 'Ahaha...')
('Renne', 'Well, may it serve as inspiration while we start<br/>ironing out what we want to do for our own festival.')
('Renne', 'Goodbye for now, Van. Thank you for inviting us.')
('Odette', 'There were so many interesting folks. I had a blast<br/>chatting them up!')
('Van', 'Glad to hear it. What about you? Had fun?')
('Albert', 'W-Well, the food was pretty stellar, and it was<br/>exciting to meet so many different kinds of people...')
('Albert', 'Augh, whatever! Thank you for inviting me, sir!')
('Odette', "Aww. 'Sir.' Lookit him being so sweet.")
('Renne', 'Sweet now, but will he go back to sour later?')
('Albert', "You don't need to analyze me!")
('Van', 'Haha...')
('Van', 'Hmm? You good?')
('Agnès', "Oh, it's nothing.")
('System', 'The train arriving on platform two will be traveling<br/>through the Auber District to...')
('Renne', "There's our train.")
('Odette', 'We gotta go, Agnès!')
('Agnès', "Right! Umm... Don't worry—it really is nothing.")
('Agnès', "It's been a challenging day, so I hope you get a lot<br/>of rest.")
('Van', 'Same to you. Night, all.')
('Van', "Whew... It's only eight and I'm already feelin' beat.")
('Van', "(...It's just my imagination, right?)")
('Van', "(We've dealt with all of Almata's leftovers. My nose<br/>ain't pickin' up anything out of the ordinary, either.)")
('Van', '(But...)')
('Albert', '㌍㌫㌻㍊㌫㍊㌻㍊㌫㌻㍊㌻㍊㌫㍊㌻㍍')
('Van', '...!')
('Van', "(I doubt I'll sniff out anything more tonight.)")
('Van', "(Better to focus on clearin' out the 4SPGs I've got<br/>piled up over the next couple days.)")
('Van', "I should make the rounds and see what else I can<br/>wrap up. I'm sure there's somethin'.")
('System', 'The next three days leading up to the festival swept<br/>through like a whirlwind.')
('System', 'Though the trouble with Almata was recent, there<br/>was very little in the way of problems relating<br/>to them.')
('System', "Instead, most of Arkride Solutions' work consisted of<br/>subcontracted tasks and other modest requests.")
('System', 'As if celebrations were already upon them, they found<br/>themselves rewarded with not just mira, but food and<br/>other material gifts as well.')
('System', "Those, together with the gradual increase in<br/>decorations strewn about the city, made them keenly<br/>aware of the festival's approach.")
('System', "Each of Van's assistants also found themselves<br/>considering their respective futures in response to<br/>what he said.")
('System', 'With all this in mind and more, it felt like the grand<br/>event was destined to become a turning point in<br/>their lives.')
('System', 'But the night before the Revolution Festival had an<br/>early surprise in store...')
('System', 'Be on guard for the seventh Genesis at the Revolution Festival tomorrow.<br/>\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000-C')
('Risette', "It's almost 10AM...")
('Aaron', 'Kept us waiting long enough.')
('Feri', 'Just look at all the people! I spot Yumé and a bunch<br/>of others, too.')
('Judith', "I'm impressed you can pick her out from the crowd.")
('Van', "Renne and your other friends are there, too, right?<br/>You sure you didn't wanna tag along?")
('Agnès', "Oh! Yes, I think it was for the best that I didn't.")
('Agnès', 'With my position, I would have needed bodyguards if<br/>I had gone, unfortunately.')
('Agnès', 'And that message we received made me want to<br/>remain here that much more.')
('Van', "Got'cha.")
('Aaron', 'I wish we knew who even sent the damn thing.')
('Quatre', "Yeah. Especially since they mentioned the Geneses—<br/>and one we don't have, at that.")
('Feri', "All we have to go on is the name 'C'...")
('Bergard', 'That name has been assumed by two people who<br/>made themselves known in the Empire in<br/>recent years.')
('Bergard', 'I do not believe either to be the one who sent that<br/>message, however.')
('Judith', 'The original was a terrorist responsible for triggering<br/>the civil war over there, right? Then someone else<br/>used it after that.')
('Risette', 'That is correct, but bear in mind that both of those<br/>matters are considered resolved. We have no reason<br/>to believe they would take up the name again.')
('Risette', "That being said...I'm certain that the alias must have<br/>been chosen through careful deliberation.")
('Van', "Yeah. Now it's just a matter of figuring out if they're<br/>tryin' to help us or mess with us.")
('Van', "But not like we got much to go on. We can't even say<br/>for sure it's someone whose name starts with a C.")
('Agnès', "That's true. It could be anyone...")
('Aaron', "Melchior's still at large, so hell, can't even write<br/>him off.")
('Feri', "Oh! There's Agnès' dad!")
(40801, "Ladies and gentlemen, it's 10AM, which means that<br/>the time has come!")
(40801, 'President Gramheart has arrived to make his speech!')
('Agnès', 'Oh...')
('Van', "There's René, too.")
(40801, 'At this time, the Edith Cathedral Choir will be<br/>singing a hymn, followed by a statement from<br/>Archbishop Jerome.')
('Agnès', '...')
('Risette', 'Creil sounds like it must have been a truly<br/>beautiful place.')
('Feri', "It was. It's where a close friend and someone I owe a<br/>lot to passed away...")
('Judith', "I've done some filming there in the past.")
('Judith', "It's hard to believe I'll never see that same scenery<br/>ever again...")
('Bergard', 'As long as we do not forget them, they will continue<br/>to live on.')
('Bergard', 'Both the people who lived there and the places in<br/>which they lived.')
('Aaron', "...I hope you're right.")
('Quatre', "I'd like to believe that, too...")
('Van', "I feel the same way—but even if we do forget, they<br/>won't be gone forever.")
('Van', 'Everyone who lives leaves a mark on others and<br/>their surroundings. That gets passed down whether<br/>people are aware of it or not.')
('Agnès', 'Van...')
('Feri', 'You think so...?')
('Bergard', "I couldn't have put it better myself.")
('Aaron', "Still, your dad's some wordsmith, huh?")
('Aaron', 'I almost found myself getting won over by all that<br/>stuff he was saying.')
('Agnès', 'Ahaha... You really think so?')
('Feri', "That's what I was gonna say! Your dad is awesome!")
('Feri', "He's super cool. I feel like I could trust him<br/>with anything!")
('Judith', 'Not to mention that face. If he ever wanted to jump<br/>the political ship, he could get work as an actor in no<br/>time flat.')
('Judith', 'Even his voice carries well. Talk about hitting<br/>the lottery...')
('Quatre', 'Rocksmith fits my image of a politician a lot more,<br/>but no one could deny how talented your dad is.')
('Quatre', "Like Aaron said, I could feel myself being roped in by<br/>his act—erm, sorry. I shouldn't have put it like that.")
('Agnès', "You don't have to apologize. I...understand how you<br/>feel, to tell you the truth.")
('Quatre', 'Oh...')
('Feri', 'Umm...')
('Van', '...')
('Bergard', 'He is certainly a man without equal—in a different<br/>sense from President Rocksmith.')
('Bergard', "I believe we're about to get another glimpse of just<br/>how, too.")
('Agnès', '...')
('Risette', 'The mourning is at an end, which means it is time for<br/>the grand unveiling.')
('Van', '...')
('Bergard', 'Hmm...')
('Quatre', 'Th-That was certainly overwhelming...')
('Aaron', "Even if we've already seen the airships and the<br/>AFs, yeah.")
('Agnès', "Right... I didn't expect him to roll them out in such a<br/>dramatic fashion, though.")
('Risette', "He appears to have made full use of all of Marduk's<br/>evaluations of them.")
('Judith', "This is my first time seeing them, so I'm more than a<br/>little blown away right now.")
('Feri', "Oh, yeah... You weren't with us when we saw some of<br/>them in Basel.")
(40000, 'This marks the end of the ceremony. Some of the<br/>new weaponry revealed will be on display in the<br/>Revolution Plaza.')
(40000, 'Visitors are also reminded that the area around the<br/>presidential building will remain closed to the public.')
('Agnès', '(Dad...)')
('Van', "Anyway, now that the big speeches are over, it's time<br/>to get to what we planned.")
('Van', "We'll spread throughout the city while checkin' for<br/>4SPGs on the bulletin boards.")
('Feri', 'Sounds good!')
('Quatre', "We'll also be keeping an eye out for any signs of the<br/>seventh Genesis...")
('Quatre', "Even if we shouldn't dedicate too much of our energy<br/>to that.")
('Van', "Yeah. There's still a chance that message was a prank,<br/>but better safe than sorry.")
('Agnès', "I wish my affairs hadn't ended up casting such a<br/>shadow over what should be a happy day...")
('Feri', "Heehee. Oh, come on! You're being silly!")
('Aaron', 'Tell me about it.')
('Judith', "I'd be more nervous NOT being in the loop on what's<br/>going on at this point. We want to be involved.")
('Van', "'Sides, I'm all for everyone enjoying the festival.<br/>Only me and one other person need to actively patrol.")
('Van', "Just if you notice somethin' out of the ordinary—<br/>anything at all—you let us all know. That's vital.")
('Quatre', "Understood. We'll be on the lookout.")
('Aaron', "Heh. My nose might not be as good as yours, but<br/>there's no way I'd miss trouble brewing.")
('Risette', "Understood. I'll always be available to switch in if I<br/>am needed.")
('Bergard', 'The same can be said for me. Should you need a<br/>hand, I will always be here.')
('Van', 'I appreciate it.')
('System', "Select one additional member to accompany Van.<br/>(This character can be swapped out from the desk in<br/>Van's office at any time.)")
('Van', "Looks like Victor's back already.")
('Van', "Paulette and Yumé must still be out enjoyin'<br/>the festival.")
('Agnès', "I hope they're having fun if they are. I wonder if<br/>Maxim is with them, too.")
('Agnès', 'Their future together started seeming a bit more<br/>promising at the party.')
('Van', "I kinda have mixed feelings about that...but I guess it<br/>ain't my call to make.")
('Van', "All right, then. Let's get to work.")
('Agnès', 'Right!')
('Feri', "I'm real curious if Maxim is with them, too.")
('Feri', 'They seemed like they were getting along really well<br/>at the party.')
('Van', "I kinda have mixed feelings about that...but I guess it<br/>ain't my call to make.")
('Van', "All right, then. Let's get to work.")
('Feri', 'Right!')
('Aaron', 'Wonder if that loser racecar driver is with them, too.')
('Aaron', 'It sure felt like sparks were flying at the party.')
('Van', "I kinda have mixed feelings about that...but I guess it<br/>ain't my call to make.")
('Van', "All right, then. Let's get to work.")
('Aaron', 'More like time to play until we drop.')
('Risette', 'Heehee. I wonder if Mr. Lugan is also with them?')
('Risette', 'They seemed to be getting along rather well at<br/>the party.')
('Van', "I kinda have mixed feelings about that...but I guess it<br/>ain't my call to make.")
('Van', "All right, then. Let's get to work.")
('Risette', 'I would be delighted to accompany you.')
('Quatre', "I wonder if Maxim's with them, too?")
('Quatre', 'They seemed to be getting along really well at<br/>the party.')
('Van', "I kinda have mixed feelings about that...but I guess it<br/>ain't my call to make.")
('Van', "All right, then. Let's get to work.")
('Quatre', 'Got it!')
('Judith', "Heh. I wonder if Maxim's with them, too?")
('Judith', 'They seemed like they were getting along pretty well<br/>at the party, in any case.')
('Van', "I kinda have mixed feelings about that...but I guess it<br/>ain't my call to make.")
('Van', "All right, then. Let's get to work.")
('Judith', "Let's do it.")
('Bergard', 'I wonder if that young racer is accompanying them?')
('Bergard', 'It looked to me as though they were getting along<br/>rather well during the party.')
('Van', "I kinda have mixed feelings about that...but I guess it<br/>ain't my call to make.")
('Van', 'Well, should we get to work? Really appreciate the<br/>help, Master.')
('Bergard', "Not at all. I'm happy to help.")
('Van', 'Ugh...')
('Shizuna', 'It looks like time has stopped in this area, too.')
('Aaron', 'Bah. Here, too, huh?')
('Kincaid', 'I thought this would be the case.')
('Risette', 'The effect extends this far, too, I see.')
('Cao', 'I expected as much.')
('Aaron', 'This place, too, huh?')
('Risette', 'It appears that many people are frozen here as well.')
('Kincaid', 'I suspect the whole city is in the same state.')
('Cao', 'I suspect the entire city is in the same state.')
('Van', "Here they come! And something's tellin' me they<br/>won't be as much of a pushover as the others.")
('Shizuna', "Heh. Looks like—these seem like they'll put up much<br/>more of a fight.")
('Aaron', 'Here they come!')
('Kincaid', 'These look to have been enhanced by a demon<br/>sphere, too.')
('Risette', 'Here they come!')
('Cao', 'These look to have been enhanced by a demon sphere<br/>as well.')
('Aaron', 'Hah! Get outta here, losers!')
('Risette', 'We shall defeat them swiftly!')
('Kincaid', 'One minute will be more than sufficient for foes<br/>like you!')
('Cao', 'This will barely take a moment!')
('Van', "That takes care of 'em. What was up with those auras<br/>they had, though?")
('Shizuna', "I'm wondering the same thing. They were in a<br/>different league compared to the last batch.")
('Van', 'Whew... These things are still a real headache.')
('Aaron', "At least they're small time. Not like they're gonna<br/>give us much trouble.")
('Risette', 'At least they were comparatively low-level devils.')
('Van', "The demon spheres're gonna have to buff 'em up a<br/>hell of a lot more than that if they want 'em to stand a<br/>chance against this crew.")
('Aaron', 'Heh. Damn right.')
('Risette', 'That said, we still cannot afford to let our guard down<br/>against them.')
('Van', 'Tch!')
('Shizuna', "Think you're being clever, do you?")
('Kincaid', "Mimicry?! Think you're being clever, do you?")
('Cao', 'Mimicry? Very impressive.')
('Van', 'Inspector! Victor!')
('Van', 'Glad to see you two ladies are safe, too.')
('Aaron', 'You guys are okay?! Good to see.')
('Risette', "I am relieved to see that you're all safe.")
('Aaron', 'You guys are okay?! Good to see.')
('Risette', "I am relieved to see that you're all safe.")
('Kincaid', "I'm glad to see the young lady from Heiyue is well.")
('Cao', 'It does my heart good to see you well, Lady Ashen.')
('Inspector Daswani', "Just when I thought we'd finished evacuating<br/>everyone, you had to show up.")
('Victor', "If it isn't our little punk of a tenant. Good to see<br/>ya hanging in there.")
('Shaheena', 'You really came!')
('Shaheena', 'You really came!')
('Ashen', "Aaron! Cao! *sniffle* You could've come a<br/>bit sooner...")
('Ashen', "You're here, Aaron! *sniffle* You could've come a<br/>bit sooner...")
('Ashen', "You're here, Cao! *sniffle* You could've come a<br/>bit sooner...")
('Ashen', "*sniffle* You could've come a bit sooner...")
('System', 'Everyone entered the bistro and relayed what they<br/>knew of the situation.')
('System', 'Their experiences mirrored each other—a strange call<br/>followed by the city and sky changing ominously, and<br/>most people being frozen in time.')
('System', 'Everyone entered the bistro and relayed what they<br/>knew of the situation.')
('System', 'As for Feri, who was with Ashen and Shaheena when<br/>the disaster struck...')
('Van', 'So she went off with Claussell, huh?')
('Ashen', "That's right. They thought they might have found<br/>something to help turn the city back to normal.")
('Ashen', "I think they're still somewhere in Old Town, though.")
('Shaheena', "They're after some kind of creepy orb.")
('Shaheena', 'It popped up in the sky after everything got messed<br/>up, but then it disappeared not long after.')
('Inspector Daswani', "They think it's working to strengthen the creatures<br/>roaming around.")
('Inspector Daswani', 'Feri went out saying she wanted to have something to<br/>help you once you came.')
('Van', 'She did, huh?')
('Risette', 'Oh, Ms. Al-Fayed...')
('Aaron', "Small fry's turned big fry now.")
('Shizuna', "She's the Kruga one, right? She's got some<br/>real potential.")
('Van', "Thanks for the heads up. We're gonna head<br/>out, then.")
('Van', 'The rest of you stay holed up here and try to hang<br/>on, okay?')
('Van', 'Can we leave everyone in your care, Inspector?')
('Inspector Daswani', 'Of course. Keeping people safe is my job at the best<br/>of times—that, and my family is here right now, too.')
('Inspector Daswani', "I know you're tough, but take care all the same.")
('Victor', 'Go find Feri and put her at ease!')
('Van', 'Will do.')
('Shizuna', "Then let's get moving.")
('Kincaid', "Then let's get moving.")
('Cao', 'Then let us depart. We will be back soon, my lady.')
('Ashen', 'O-Okay... Just be safe, okay?')
('Ashen', 'And I mean that for you, too, Aaron!')
('Aaron', 'Heh. That just makes me sound like an afterthought.')
('Inspector Daswani', 'Hmm?')
('Ashen', "The fog's gotten less thick all of a sudden!")
('Shaheena', "Then they must've been successful!")
('System', 'They returned to Montmart to report back to<br/>everyone and discuss their next move.')
('Inspector Daswani', 'So you plan to keep making your way around the<br/>other districts, then?')
('Van', "Yeah. It's gonna be between Riverside and Central<br/>Station, since both of those are fairly close.")
('Van', "One's where Aaron is, and the other's where<br/>Risette is... I'm sure they're both fine, though.")
('Feri', 'Oh, without a doubt!')
('Fie', "Hmm... Maybe I'll tag along for a while, then.")
('Fie', "Our local guild branch is in front of the station, and I<br/>wanna know what's going on by the river, too.")
('Van', "Yeah. We've been around all the major districts in<br/>this part of the city now.")
('Van', "Think it's about time we made our way up north.")
('Fie', "Hmm... Maybe I'll tag along for a while, then.")
('Fie', "I wanna know what's going on in the center and<br/>north of the city. I still need to get in touch with the<br/>guild, too.")
('Van', "Yeah. The area around Central Station is the only<br/>district in this part of town that we haven't visited yet.")
('Van', "Risette was in charge of that area. I'm sure she's<br/>fine, though.")
('Feri', 'Oh, without a doubt!')
('Aaron', "Yeah. Chick's like a tank.")
('Fie', "Hmm... Maybe I'll tag along for a while, then.")
('Fie', "It works out since that's where our local guild<br/>branch is.")
('Van', "Riverside is the only district in this part of town that<br/>we haven't visited yet.")
('Van', "Aaron was in charge of that area. I'm sure he's<br/>fine, though.")
('Feri', 'Oh, without a doubt!')
('Risette', 'I quite agree. It would take more than this to<br/>defeat him.')
('Fie', "Hmm... Maybe I'll tag along for a while, then.")
('Fie', "I want to know what's going on in Riverside—plus I<br/>still need to get in touch with the guild.")
('Shizuna', "If Sylphid's good to go with you, then I think it's time<br/>I headed off on my own.")
('Van', "Makes sense. Thanks for all the help you've given us.")
('Shizuna', 'Not at all. Hanging out with you helped me get a<br/>better handle on the situation, so it worked out for<br/>both of us.')
('Shizuna', "I'm going to meet up with Kurogane and the others,<br/>so if we learn anything, we'll give you a heads up.")
('Shizuna', 'See you around.')
('Cao', "If Fie will be accompanying you, then I suppose it's<br/>about time I took my leave.")
('Van', 'You probably got a lot of other stuff to take care<br/>of, huh? I get it.')
('Cao', 'Thank you for your understanding.')
('Cao', 'I will send someone to escort you later, Lady Ashen.<br/>Please remain here in the meantime.')
('Cao', 'Well, excuse me, then—and do take care of<br/>yourself, Aaron.')
('Aaron', 'Pfft. Same to you.')
('Cao', 'Farewell for now.')
('Ashen', 'W-Wait! Cao!')
('Kincaid', 'If Sylphid is accompanying you, perhaps I ought to<br/>take my leave here.')
('Van', "Makes sense, considerin' your job. Just try not to die<br/>out there.")
('Kincaid', 'Heh. I could say the same to you. Goodbye for<br/>now, then.')
('Kincaid', 'I leave law enforcement in this area to you,<br/>Inspector.')
('Inspector Daswani', 'Understood.')
('Feri', 'Oh...')
('Ashen', "She's supposed to be really strong from all I've heard,<br/>but she wasn't at all what I was expecting.")
('Ashen', "I can't believe him! He can't even come back for<br/>me himself?!")
('Ashen', 'But that ice-cold demeanor is part of what I love<br/>about him. ㈱')
('Aaron', "Ugh. There's no saving you.")
('Ashen', "Another intellectual type with glasses, huh? He's not<br/>up to my main man's standards, but he's still not bad<br/>at aaall. ㈱")
('Aaron', "First Cao, now him... You've really got shit taste<br/>in guys.")
('Shaheena', "She's surprisingly chill.")
('Van', "Well, we'd better get on with our own business.")
('Victor', 'Just make sure you do right by your employees,<br/>young man.')
('Feri', 'Sir...')
('Van', "Oh, I will. Almost goes without sayin'.")
('Van', "And I'll bring Yumé and Paulette back safe, too—you<br/>can count on it.")
('Victor', 'Heh... Thank you.')
('Fie', 'The guild will also support him however we can.')
('System', 'Feri rejoined the party.')
('System', "Fie joined as a guest in Shizuna's place.")
('System', "Fie joined as a guest in Kincaid's place.")
('System', "Fie joined as a guest in Cao's place.")
('System', "Fie joined as a guest in Kincaid's place.")
('System', "Fie joined as a guest in Cao's place.")
('System', 'To advance the main story, inspect the car and select<br/>the next destination.')
('Fie', 'So, about your plan to travel north through the center<br/>of the city...')
('Fie', 'There was heavy traffic on the capital expressway<br/>when the crisis struck, so it might be tough to get<br/>there by car.')
('Van', 'Bah. Really?')
('Aaron', 'Makes sense, but damn, that sucks.')
('Risette', 'We could likely still make the journey if we used back<br/>roads and the like, but it would be much slower.')
('Feri', "Isn't there another route that we could take?")
('Fie', "I've got one in mind. What do you think of taking a<br/>detour through the Blacklight District?")
('Fie', "I'm pretty sure Zin should be there now, and it'll be a<br/>good base of operations going forward.")
('Van', "That's not a bad idea, actually.")
('Van', "I think my master was there, too. It'd be a huge help<br/>to have him with us.")
('Aaron', 'Yeah, he is one damn strong dude.')
('Risette', 'We may be able to resupply there as well.')
('Van', 'All right. Best way to the Blacklight District from<br/>here is that secret entrance in Riverside.')
('Van', "But there's no way to be sure the route there'll be safe,<br/>so better make sure we're prepared before headin' off.")
('Feri', 'Roger that!')
('Fie', "Okay, let's roll!")
('System', 'To advance the main story, go to the underground<br/>entrance in the northern part of Riverside.')
('Van', '(Hmm... Now where should we go next?)')
('System', 'Once a district has been selected, the others will be<br/>temporarily unavailable.')
('Van', "(Aaron was the one stationed in this district.<br/>I'm guessin' he's still there, too.)")
('Van', '(Time to go find him!)')
('Van', "(Risette was the one stationed in this district.<br/>I'm guessin' she's still there, too.)")
('Van', '(Time to go find her!)')
('Agnès', "I can't find him anywhere!")
('Aaron', "But if he's not here, then where the hell could he be?")
('Elaine', "(Aramis? No, after all that's happened, I'm sure—)")
('Renne', 'Could he be on the rooftop, perhaps?')
('Renne', 'I remember him talking up there during the party—is<br/>he partial to that spot at all?')
('Feri', 'That must be it!')
('Quatre', "Let's go, Agnès!")
('Agnès', 'Right!')
('System', 'The final battle awaits. Please ensure all party<br/>members are fully equipped.')
('Judith', 'He really is up here!')
('Risette', 'Thank you, Mare.')
('Elaine', '...!')
('Renne', 'This must be a barrier that analyzes those who try to<br/>walk through it—and will only let people from<br/>Arkride Solutions pass.')
('Renne', "Aww. If I'd known this was going to happen, I'd have<br/>tried sneaking my way into a job, too.")
('Agnès', "I'm so sorry, Elaine.")
('Elaine', "Don't worry about it. I'll leave this in your hands.")
('Elaine', 'Just give him a big smack for us, all right?')
('Feri', 'You got it!')
('Aaron', "Then let's do this!")
('Agnès', 'In the end, Van came back to us safe and sound.')
('Agnès', 'That marked the beginning of a very busy three<br/>weeks that somehow flew by in an instant.')
('Agnès', 'We all did what we could to help Van deal with the<br/>aftermath of what had happened while making<br/>preparations of our own.')
('Agnès', 'Then, on the day that the second term at Aramis<br/>ended and my winter vacation began...')
('Lott', '*sigh* I posted the request, but will they really come?')
('Agnès', "Hey, Van. Do you think that's our client?")
('Van', "Don't see who else it could be.")
('Van', "Are you Lott? We're from Arkride Solutions.")
('Lott', "Oh, nice to meet you! Yes, I'm Lott. I'm the one who<br/>made the request.")
('Lott', "I've heard stories about you, but I never thought I'd<br/>get to talk to you in person.")
('Lott', "I wasn't too sure if asking a spriggan for help would<br/>get me anywhere, but I had to try.")
('Lott', 'Thank you so much for coming. I need your help to<br/>save my friend!')
('Van', "All right. We'll see what we can do, so don't worry.<br/>Name's Van. I'm the boss, and this here's Agnès.<br/>She's kinda like my assistant.")
('Agnès', "I still have a lot to learn, but I promise I'll do<br/>everything I can to help!")
('Lott', "Oh, so you help out with problems, too? I wouldn't<br/>expect a girl like you to—")
('Lott', "Ack! Sorry! No offense or anything. I know I<br/>shouldn't judge a book by its cover, but there I go,<br/>sticking my foot in my mouth.")
('Agnès', "Heehee, that's okay. No offense was taken.")
('Van', "Enough chattin'. Let's get down to brass tacks.")
('Van', 'Your request mentioned your friend swiping some<br/>cash from the till at work, right? And you wanted to<br/>figure out why.')
('Van', "Mind giving us a rundown of the situation? What this<br/>friend's like, and anything else you can think of.")
('Lott', 'Not at all.')
('Lott', "My friend's name is Daniel.")
('Lott', "We've known each other since we went to<br/>Sunday School.")
('Lott', "Nowadays, we're both working at the same café<br/>part time.")
('Agnès', 'It sounds like you two are close.')
('Lott', "Yeah, we are. Which is why something just doesn't<br/>add up for me.")
('Lott', "He's such a good guy. I've never known him to do<br/>anything bad in my entire life.")
('Lott', 'It all happened right as we were closing up<br/>shop yesterday.')
('Lott', 'I just so happened to see him slip the money from the<br/>register into his pocket. I was honestly really shocked.')
('Agnès', 'I can imagine why. It sounds really out of character<br/>for him to do that.')
('Van', 'What did you do after that?')
('Lott', "Umm... Nothing, actually. I'm embarrassed to admit<br/>it, but I was too chicken to confront him.")
('Lott', "I just pretended like I didn't see anything...")
('Lott', "D-Don't get the wrong idea! I was worried, so I tried<br/>asking around without giving it away. Y'know, to see<br/>if anyone had any idea what was going on.")
('Lott', 'I finally got a lead this morning.')
('Lott', 'I learned that Daniel is going to do some shopping at<br/>the orbal store over on Station Street!')
('Van', "And? People go to orbal stores all the time.<br/>Doesn't really mean anything by itself.")
('Lott', "Maybe if you don't know Daniel. I don't know<br/>anyone with less interest in orbal devices than him.<br/>He must have a good reason to go looking for it.")
('Agnès', 'When you put it like that, I can see how it might look<br/>a little worrying.')
('Van', "Thanks for the rundown. I think we've got a good<br/>idea of what's goin' on.")
('Van', "First, I think we gotta figure out what he was<br/>planning on buyin' with the money he swiped.")
('Van', '(All right, then. Should we get to work?)')
('Lott', "Daniel's not the kind of guy who would steal from<br/>work, I swear.")
('Lott', "Maybe we can get to the bottom of this if we figure<br/>out why he's going to the orbal store in the first place.")
('Lott', "Would you please look into it for me? I'd really<br/>appreciate it.")
('Van', '(All right, then. Should we get to work?)')
('Van', 'Sorry. Let me think about it first.')
('Van', "We've got some other errands to run, too. Get back<br/>to you when we're done.")
('Lott', "It's okay. I understand.")
('Lott', "I'll be waiting here. Hope to see you again soon!")
('Van', 'All right. Ready to roll.')
('Van', "We're gonna stake out your friend. Keep an eye on<br/>his movements for a little while and see if anything<br/>turns up. Sound good?")
('Lott', "Yes, that's fine. Thank you again for agreeing to help!")
('Van', 'Hold up. Before I go, I still got some questions<br/>for you.')
('Van', 'First, what does Daniel actually look like?')
('Lott', "Right. Daniel's got black hair and he usually wears a<br/>brown jacket.")
('Lott', 'I should have a photo of him around somewhere.<br/>I can send it to you later.')
('Agnès', "Black hair and a brown jacket... Got it. We'll keep an<br/>eye out for him.")
('Van', "You do that. In the meantime, think you can<br/>figure out exactly when he's gonna go to the store?")
('Van', "You two are close, so you've got a better chance than<br/>anyone else of figurin' that out.")
('Lott', "You've got a point. I'll see what I can do!")
('Lott', "I'll let you two know what I find out after I get in<br/>contact with him.")
('Van', 'Perfect. Time to get to work, then.')
('Van', 'But before anything else, we still need to pay the<br/>repair shop a visit.')
('Agnès', "Right. We shouldn't forget that.")
('Van', 'Perfect. Time to get to work, then.')
('Agnès', "It was nice to meet you, Lott! Don't worry, we'll take<br/>care of this.")
('System', 'Quest Friendly Felon started!')
('Chris', "That's all the second-hand stuff that we've got lately.")
('Chris', 'Thank you for buying so much! We sincerely<br/>appreciate it.')
('Yimai', "Trust me. If anyone's thankful, it's me.")
('Yimai', "I'm just happy I could find so much<br/>intriguing merchandise.")
('Yimai', "Haha, today's my lucky day, truly!")
('Van', "There's our guy. Hey, folks. Don't mind us.")
('Chris', "Oh, hey, Van! I didn't see you there.")
('Yimai', "'Van'? You must be that spriggan everyone's been<br/>talking about.")
('Van', 'Maybe I am. Sorry to bug you. Care to answer a<br/>few questions?')
('Van', 'We wanted to talk about some of your merchandise.')
('Yimai', "Oh? I'm listening.")
('System', "Van and Agnès explained their client's request<br/>to Yimai.")
('Yimai', "Hmm... So you're looking for a Pintilie wallet? I did<br/>recently come across one, yes.")
('Yimai', "Time-wise, it does line up with the one you're<br/>looking for.")
('Yimai', 'Crafty lot, you two, managing to sniff your way<br/>to me.')
('Van', "We're just cleaning up after the bracers. They were<br/>havin' a rough time figurin' out the specific broker<br/>that got it.")
('Van', 'But anyone with actual experience in the black<br/>market will know what tree to go bark up first.<br/>Yours, old man.')
('Yimai', "Haha, I guess I've built something of a reputation for<br/>myself over the years.")
('Agnès', "So...are you going to part with the wallet? We'll make<br/>sure it gets back to its rightful owner.")
('Yimai', 'Hmm...')
('Yimai', "What my merchandise goes through before it gets to<br/>me is really none of my business. It's in my hands<br/>now, and that's what matters to me.")
('Yimai', "I can't give away my valuable merch to just anyone<br/>that comes asking for it. I'd go out of business.")
('Yimai', "Now, if you were to come to me as a paying<br/>customer, it'd be a different story.")
('Agnès', "You still intend to sell it even though you know<br/>it's stolen? That's...")
('Yimai', "Stolen? Why, I have no idea what you're talking<br/>about!")
('Van', "I get how you feel, Agnès, but if we're gonna get that<br/>wallet back, we'll have to play by this guy's rules.")
('Yimai', "I knew your boss would get it. In that case, why don't<br/>we start talking numbers, hmm?")
('Yimai', "This wallet of yours is practically new. Whoever its<br/>old owner was must've taken good care of it.")
('Yimai', "With that in mind, I'm willing to offer you<br/>a discount. Ten percent off market price. Down from<br/>10,000 mira to 9,000. Seems fair to me.")
('Agnès', "Nine thousand mira? I don't know...")
('Van', "If you're not happy with the price, you don't gotta<br/>take it.")
('Van', "Try haggling with him. See if you can get him to bite<br/>for cheaper. Don't got much to lose.")
('Agnès', "...Okay, why not? It'll be a good learning experience<br/>as well.")
('Yimai', "Oho! Going to try your hand at bargaining with me,<br/>young lady? Let's see what you bring to the table.")
('Agnès', "(I know Alicia said she was willing to buy the wallet<br/>back if that's what it took.)")
('Agnès', "(But 9,000 mira for it isn't a fair price, considering<br/>everything we know.)")
('Agnès', "(I've got to give him a good reason to change<br/>his mind!)")
('Agnès', 'That wallet is a precious birthday present our client<br/>received from her parents.')
('Agnès', "Just because we're willing to pay to get it back if we<br/>have to doesn't mean that 9,000 mira is a fair<br/>asking price!")
('Yimai', "*sigh* It's almost cute how you think that sob story's<br/>gonna work on me. I don't see why that's a reason for<br/>me to lower my asking price.")
('Van', "This guy's ruthless, Agnès. If you wanna get<br/>anywhere with him, keep it about business. That's the<br/>only language he'll talk.")
('Yimai', "Ruthless, eh? I'll take that as a compliment.")
('Agnès', "(Argh, that didn't work. I'll have to come up with<br/>another argument...)")
('Agnès', 'Knowingly selling stolen merchandise is a<br/>major crime.')
('Agnès', "We might be willing to look away and purchase it<br/>back, but just a ten percent discount won't cut it.<br/>You have to do better than that!")
('Yimai', 'Or else what? Are you threatening me, young lady?')
('Yimai', "Being a client of mine is a privilege. I won't let you<br/>strong-arm me into a deal.")
('Van', 'Hate to break it to you, but he calls the shots here.<br/>Better try a different tactic if you wanna get anywhere<br/>with this chat.')
('Agnès', "(Argh, that didn't work. I'll have to come up with<br/>another argument...)")
('Agnès', 'We had a conversation with another vendor before<br/>we came here.')
('Agnès', 'He told us that specific wallet can be personalized<br/>with an engraving.')
('Agnès', 'We know for a fact that our client received the wallet<br/>for her twentieth birthday.')
('Agnès', "It's extremely likely that the wallet has some sort of<br/>birthday message engraved on it.")
('Agnès', 'Even if it looks new, the engraving alone would dock<br/>a lot of its value.')
('Agnès', "Before we agree on a price, could you confirm<br/>whether or not that's the case?")
('Yimai', 'Ugh, you drive a hard bargain, young lady.')
('Yimai', "All right, I'll come clean. You're right. The wallet is,<br/>in fact, engraved.")
('Yimai', "I don't know whose birthday it was, but the message<br/>on it is to that effect.")
('Yimai', 'That aside, the wallet itself is in pristine condition.')
('Yimai', "But you've made your point. I'm willing to offer you a<br/>thirty percent discount instead. That sounds<br/>reasonable, yes?")
('Agnès', "No, I don't think it does. I think you can still do<br/>better than that.")
('Agnès', "(We're getting closer to a fair price, but I know he's<br/>still trying to take me for a ride.)")
('Agnès', "(If I want to get a good deal on it, it's now or never!)")
('Agnès', '(Maybe I should just settle for a 30 percent discount<br/>if it means Alicia will get her wallet back...)')
('Agnès', "(No, no! I know that wallet can't be worth so<br/>much money!)")
('Agnès', '(Just the engraving could dock its value to about a<br/>tenth of the retail price. Maybe I should go for that?)')
('Agnès', "(No, that's probably too low. It's still in good<br/>condition, and it's from a very popular series. In<br/>that case...)")
('Agnès', "We'll give you fifty percent. I think that's a much<br/>fairer price.")
('Yimai', 'Oh, do you now? Mind illuminating me?')
('Agnès', 'I can understand why you would insist on limiting the<br/>discount to thirty percent when the wallet is from<br/>such a popular brand.')
('Agnès', "But we really can't forget about the birthday message<br/>addressed to our client.")
('Agnès', "It'll be hard to find a client willing to buy an item<br/>with an engraving addressed to someone else.")
('Agnès', "If you want to make it an enticing purchase, you'd<br/>have to reduce the price one way or the other.")
('Van', "I'm with her on this one.")
('Van', "I'd give it up if I were you. You're just going to make<br/>yourself look bad if you keep playing hardball in the<br/>face of the facts.")
('Yimai', 'Nrgh!')
('Yimai', '*sigh* All right, all right. You win.')
('Yimai', "A fifty percent discount it is. That'll be 5,000 mira,<br/>final offer. Do we have a deal?")
('Agnès', 'Yes! Thank you so much!')
('Van', 'Damn, good work. Not bad for a rookie.')
('Van', "Here's your 5,000 mira.")
('System', 'Van took the sum out of the money prepared for the<br/>request and handed it to Yimai.')
('Yimai', "Looks good to me. Here's the wallet for you two.")
('Agnès', 'A Pintilie memorial wallet! This is it! We did it!')
('Yimai', 'I was hoping to make more money off of that, but it<br/>is what it is.')
('Yimai', "With that, I'll be taking my leave. If any of your other<br/>clients need something from me, I'd be happy to do<br/>business again. Until then!")
('Van', "Damn, that old man's one tough customer. Give him<br/>a rege and he'll take a selge.")
('Van', "Anyway, we got what we were after. Let's get that<br/>wallet back to its rightful owner.")
('Agnès', "Right! I'm just glad this all will have a happy ending.")
('Eddy', "C'mon, it's just 5,000 mira. You can lend me<br/>that much! Call it my wage for helping around<br/>the store.")
('Brenda', 'Ugh, again with that nonsense?')
('Brenda', "I wouldn't call 'doing something for a few minutes<br/>before flaking out' helping at all!")
('Van', "Uhh, sorry to interrupt. I know you're in the middle<br/>of somethin', but do you think we could talk?")
('Brenda', "Oh. Sorry, Van. Didn't mean for you to see that.<br/>What can I do you for?")
('Eddy', "Back off, asshole! Can't you see me and the old lady<br/>are having an important conversation right now?")
('Brenda', "Hey! That's no way to talk to a customer!")
('Eddy', "And what're you gonna do about that?")
('Agnès', 'Er, maybe we should try again later?')
('Feri', "*sigh* Just like that, they're back at it.")
('Aaron', "Sheesh. Give it a few more minutes and they'll rip<br/>each other's throat out.")
('Van', 'Whoa, chill out, folks. We wanted to talk to<br/>Eddy, actually. Can you give us a sec?')
('Eddy', 'What? Me? What do you want?')
('Brenda', "If it's him you're after, take your conversation outside.<br/>He'll scare away business if he's inside much longer.")
('Eddy', "I've seen you guys around the shop before. What do<br/>you want?")
('Van', "This is strictly business. We're investigating<br/>somethin' for a client.")
('Van', 'What can you tell us about a guy named Mark?<br/>Rolls in the same gang as you, right? Desire.')
('Eddy', "That guy? Why should I tell you anything? I don't<br/>owe you people!")
('Agnès', 'Please, you should really reconsider.')
('Agnès', "We were hired by Mark's girlfriend.")
('Agnès', "She was worried because she hasn't been able to<br/>contact him. We're looking into things for her.")
('Feri', "We're asking around for Mark's girlfriend.")
('Feri', "She hasn't heard from him in a while and she's<br/>really worried. Could you please help?")
('Aaron', "It's not just anyone asking. Dude's girlfriend wants<br/>to know.")
('Aaron', "Lady's been real worried she can't get in touch with<br/>him, so she contacted us.")
('Eddy', "Oh, so that's what's going on? All right.")
('Eddy', "I can see why you'd wanna put her mind at ease.<br/>It'd suck if they bumped into each other one day and<br/>she had no idea what's been going on.")
('Eddy', '...You just wanna talk, yeah? Nothing more?')
('Van', "(That wasn't hard.)")
('Van', "Yeah, that's all we need. Whatever you know.<br/>Anything helps.")
('Eddy', "Well, I don't got much for ya.")
('Eddy', 'Mark asked to be cut loose from the gang a<br/>while back. They let him go.')
('Eddy', "Haven't heard much from 'im since. Been quiet.")
('Agnès', "Wait. You're saying he's already out of the gang?")
('Feri', "Then, he's out of the gang already?")
('Aaron', "So he's not running with you guys anymore?")
('Eddy', "That's right. And I don't think it was out of the blue<br/>or nothing. They'd apparently been thinkin' about it<br/>for a while.")
('Eddy', 'About a month ago, our boss agreed to let him go.<br/>On one condition.')
('Van', "All right, we're getting somewhere. What condition?")
('Eddy', "As I hear it, we'd just gotten a big job from Almata.")
('Eddy', "They had some beef with this other group that's been<br/>hiring jaegers or somethin'.")
('Eddy', "Mark was supposed to infiltrate their base and get<br/>some intel on 'em.")
('Agnès', 'That...sounds really dangerous. He could get caught<br/>by the jaegers.')
('Feri', 'Did... Did they actually just send in a single scout on<br/>an infiltration and recon job?')
('Eddy', "Uh, yeah, I guess? Somethin' along those lines.")
('Aaron', "Give me a break. That's not the sort of shit you put<br/>an amateur up to.")
('Van', "Not the kinda gig you'd expect to make it back alive<br/>from, that's for sure.")
('Van', "But he's out now, so somethin' must've gone<br/>right, yeah? That what you heard?")
('Eddy', 'Something like that. Looks like the crazy bastard<br/>pulled it off.')
('Eddy', "Can't imagine shit was easy, though. The jaegers are<br/>in Baume, and that's a long ways away.")
('Van', 'Baume?')
('Agnès', 'It also came up when we visited the gun shop earlier.')
('Agnès', 'Pieces keep clicking into place...')
('Feri', 'I think I remember hearing that name back at the<br/>gun shop.')
('Feri', 'This is getting really complicated...')
('Aaron', 'That chick at the gun shop mentioned that place, too.')
('Aaron', 'So this is all related?')
('Van', "We ain't sure yet. We got no hard evidence on it.")
('Van', "While you're here, can you think of anyone else that<br/>might know what's goin' on with Mark?")
('Eddy', "Yeah, I know a guy. Mark always talked about this<br/>childhood friend of his. Name's Simon, I think.")
('Eddy', "If I'm remembering correctly, he said Simon's the<br/>basketball team captain over at Seiden.")
('Eddy', '(Must be nice having a cool friend like that.)')
('Eddy', "(I'm gonna pull off something real badass one of<br/>these days and then all the senior members will finally<br/>want to hang out with me!)")
('Van', "Then our next stop's the Seiden District. Thanks<br/>for that. Owe you one.")
('Eddy', "Yeah, whatever. Don't go wastin' that info, okay?")
('Huck', "Hey, there. You folks look pretty glum. What's<br/>going on?")
('Van', "We're in the middle of investigatin' a politician for<br/>a job. You see...")
('Huck', "Now I understand. You've left no stone unturned, eh?<br/>You've dug up a lot of stuff meant to stay buried.")
('Huck', 'Anyway, yes. Taylor and I were good friends.')
('Huck', "We'd debate about all sorts of things over drinks.<br/>Like policies to diminish racial disparity and such.")
('Agnès', "(I've always wondered what this man gets up to here.<br/>Now I'm even more curious...)")
('Feri', "Wow. That's pretty surprising.")
('Aaron', 'No kidding? Here I thought all you did was sweat<br/>it at the sauna.')
('Van', "That's 'cause Huck manages a well-established<br/>investment firm.")
('Van', 'People like that always have connections with the top<br/>brass calling.')
('Agnès', 'Oh, that makes sense!')
('Feri', "I just assumed you were some random sauna fan.<br/>That's amazing!")
('Aaron', "Goes to show you really can't judge a book by<br/>its cover.")
('Huck', "Haha, that's okay. I'd rather it stay like that. I prefer<br/>how people treat me when they don't know.")
('Van', "Back on track. This guy's son is still alive, yeah?<br/>You got any idea where he went?")
('Huck', 'That I do. His name is Roderick.')
('Huck', 'After the attack, I believe he went to live with some<br/>relatives in Altair.')
('Huck', "As for what he's up to these days, I have no clue.")
('Van', "Got'cha. Back to lookin' for someone who does, then.")
('Van', 'Actually, one more question while I still got you here.<br/>Do you know what happened to the culprit?')
('Huck', 'Culprits, actually, but I do. There were two of them.<br/>They went on the run after the fact but got caught<br/>sometime later.')
('Huck', 'Their testimony suggested that there had been some<br/>friction for a while.')
('Huck', 'They mentioned something about an intruder letting<br/>the kid get away, and that they thought someone was<br/>selling them out.')
('Huck', "From what I understand, Roderick's own recollection<br/>of what happened is pretty hazy.")
('Van', "I'm curious about this intruder letting the kid escape.")
('Agnès', "If you're right, that's nothing short of a miracle.")
('Agnès', 'Then maybe...')
('Feri', "Wow. At least he made it out alive, so that's good.")
('Feri', 'If he did, then...')
('Aaron', "An intruder? That's interesting. I think I can see the<br/>bigger picture now.")
('Huck', "Oh, now that I think about it, I might know<br/>somebody who'd have an idea about Roderick's<br/>whereabouts these days.")
('Huck', 'You should talk to the editor-in-chief of the<br/>Tyrell Times. She was all over that whole case back<br/>in the day.')
('Huck', "With any luck, she might still be keeping up with it.<br/>Wouldn't hurt to ask, at the very least.")
('Van', "Good to know. Hopefully will save us the trouble of<br/>sniffin' out the info ourselves. Thanks, Huck.<br/>Owe you one.")
('Huck', "Heh, I won't say no to gratuity! I think some milk<br/>gelato will do just fine as thanks after a long soak.")
('Van', "Sure thing. I'll remember to hook you up with<br/>some later.")
('Agnès', 'I suppose our next destination is the Tyrell<br/>Times, then.')
('Feri', "Well, what're we waiting for? Let's head to the<br/>Tyrell Times!")
('Aaron', "Guess the next stop on this involuntary city tour is<br/>Tyrell Times, then. Ugh, this gig's been a big pain in<br/>the ass.")
('Van', "Hey, Brenda. I'm dropping by 'cause of a job.")
('Van', "I wanted to ask about your son. Mind telling us what<br/>your kid's been up to lately?")
('Brenda', 'Oh, Aidios. Should I be worried? Did that boy of<br/>mine do something?!')
('Agnès', "No, no. Nothing to be alarmed about! We're looking<br/>into something and we thought to ask him a<br/>few questions.")
('Agnès', 'How has he been doing lately? Feel free to go into as<br/>much detail as you can, please.')
('Brenda', "That's a relief. Or as much as can be, really. I get no<br/>end of stress when it comes to that boy.")
('Brenda', "As for how he's been lately... Something does come<br/>to mind.")
('Brenda', "He usually doesn't have a single mira to his name and<br/>will constantly demand I lend him some, but he looks<br/>like he's doing well lately.")
('Brenda', "Actually, he even said he'd finally pay me back all<br/>he owed.")
('Feri', "That's good news, isn't it? You don't sound excited.")
('Aaron', "Dude could be doing a whole lot worse, but you don't<br/>look too happy about it.")
('Brenda', "I know for a fact that boy doesn't have a job.<br/>Not even a part time one.")
('Brenda', "The money he's been getting is coming from that<br/>gang he's a part of.")
('Brenda', "And if that's not enough, they said they might<br/>promote him if he did good with his current job, if<br/>you can believe it.")
('Brenda', "I think he mentioned it having to do with helping<br/>this girl he'd met, but I didn't really get it.")
('Van', "The plot thickens. Must be some big shit he's up to if<br/>they're offering him authority.")
('Risette', "There's also the matter of the girl in question.")
('Risette', 'At this point, I believe we can more or less piece<br/>together what his task entails.')
('Brenda', "*sigh* So Eddy's really up to something dangerous,<br/>isn't he? That stupid son of mine...")
('Brenda', "Could you please lend him a hand?<br/>Despite everything, I'm still his mother and would<br/>hate to see him hurt.")
('Van', "Don't even need to ask. Neighbors gotta look out for<br/>each other.")
('Agnès', "*sigh* I'm glad we're finally done talking to Brenda.<br/>That was a lot.")
('Agnès', "We have everything we need to report back to Mr.<br/>Rumsfeld now, don't we?")
('Risette', "Correct. Considering when the two sides are<br/>supposed to meet, the timing couldn't be better.")
('Van', "Which means we're headin' over to Dirke Memorial<br/>Park next.")
('Van', "We'll take the time to go through all the info we<br/>gathered and come up with an action plan.")
('Feri', 'Sounds good to me!')
('Aaron', "Fine by me. You're the boss.")
('Van', 'That key we got from the driver probably goes to one<br/>of the coin lockers here.')
('Van', "What do you say? Should we check what's inside?")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', '*gulp*')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Absolutely! I'm ready!")
('Agnès', "Okay. Let's head in.")
('System', 'Marielle and the others found the coin lockers tucked<br/>away in a corner of the subway station.')
('System', 'They located the one that corresponded with the key<br/>they held, finding a black leather notebook inside.')
('System', 'The group then proceeded to move to a quiet location<br/>in order to inspect the contents of the notebook.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'I-I need a little more time to prepare first. Do<br/>you mind?')
('Van', "Take all the time you need. We won't start<br/>without you.")
('Aaron', 'This is something, all right.')
('Quatre', "I didn't get to talk to Dingo much...")
('Quatre', '...but I know for a fact that he was an<br/>outstanding man.')
('Risette', 'Indeed. Not just anyone could pursue Almata to the<br/>degree he did without backup.')
('Judith', "It was probably his way of making amends for the role<br/>he played in Dantès' rise to power.")
('Judith', "These notes mention how the previous boss' family<br/>was murdered, too. Even they didn't get spared...")
('Feri', "That's... That's horrible.")
('Agnès', 'Such a heavy burden for him to carry...')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "But... But that wasn't his fault! He couldn't have<br/>known that's what would happen.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "I can't imagine he felt like he could be in the public<br/>eye anymore after that.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "And that's why he took me under his wing...<br/>A good-for-nothing rookie...")
('Van', '...')
('Bergard', 'It appears he compiled quite a few notes about the<br/>ringleaders we took down in Oración as well.')
('Van', "Yeah. Let's take a look.")
('System', "Viola     Gender: Female, Age: 26<br/>Originally from a minor noble family in the Qadas region in<br/>the Central East. Her family fell into bankruptcy after Qadas'<br/>annexation by Valis, Viola herself being sold off to a<br/>wealthy merchant so they could make ends meet.")
('System', 'She soon fell into the hands of a criminal<br/>organization that was targeting the merchant.<br/>Though initially nothing more than a plaything and<br/>object of pleasure, she eventually managed to oust the<br/>boss and wrestle control into her own hands.<br/>Her brutal leadership reputation precedes her.')
('System', 'When, two years later, the group tried to expand their<br/>influence into Calvard, they caught the attention<br/>of Almata. Conflict with them was brief, as they were<br/>quickly obliterated by Dantès, to whom Viola swore<br/>loyalty afterward.')
('System', "As a consequence of her turbulent past, she's<br/>incredibly dependent on Dantès, which might be the<br/>reason she harbors a fierce rivalry with her fellow<br/>Melchior, their positions equivalent within<br/>the organization.")
('System', 'Though the body of her needlegun was produced by<br/>Zecht Arms, the full piece is not a part of their<br/>official lineup. Further research regarding the origin<br/>of her weapon is needed.')
('System', 'Alexandre   Gender: Male, Age: 35<br/>Born in the former Principality of North Ambria in northwestern<br/>Zemuria, he was five years old when the Salt Pale appeared,<br/>sowing chaos in his homeland. Him and his father, then<br/>protectors of the ruling family, fled alongside Prince Balmund<br/>when he fled the country. Spent most of his childhood and adolescent<br/>years in the free city of Taslem.')
('System', 'Trained by his father in the traditional military arts of<br/>their homeland, he served the former ruling family<br/>until the age of 25, though his life was soon thrown<br/>into chaos.')
('System', "His father and he were both ordered to retake<br/>North Ambria following the death of the Northern<br/>Jaegers' figurehead—the current ruler since Prince<br/>Balmund's escape.")
('System', "After their assault on North Ambria's capital,<br/>Haliask, they managed to seize and control the city<br/>for a time, acting as its effective government before<br/>being overthrown by the Northern Jaegers.")
('System', 'This ensued a massacre of the remaining civilians in<br/>Haliask, mandated by the crazed former<br/>Prince Balmund. Standing in opposition with one<br/>another, Alexandre and his father dueled to the<br/>death, Alexandre emerging victorious before<br/>withdrawing from the battlefield. Though his current<br/>whereabouts are unknown, it is believed that Prince<br/>Balmund was swiftly—and secretly—executed by the<br/>Northern Jaegers following his capture.')
('System', 'Wandering from one corps to another, Alexandre was<br/>eventually scouted out by Dantès himself, and brought<br/>into a leadership position within Almata.')
('System', "Though outwardly austere and restrained, he's<br/>merciless in combat, sparing none who dare<br/>cross him.")
('System', 'His ultimate goal being the search for his final resting<br/>place, he has rejected any attempt at persuading him<br/>to leave Almata.')
('System', 'Despite the mechanized gauntlets he wields not being<br/>part of their official lineup, it does appear that they<br/>were developed by Zecht Arms.')
('System', 'Olympia     Gender: Female, Age: 19<br/>Little is known about her, although she allegedly hails from<br/>a remote village hidden in eastern Zemuria.')
('System', 'Rumors say the entire village was comprised of<br/>heretical puppeteers who worshiped a doll made in<br/>the image of an angel.')
('System', "Thought to be an artifact of some sort, the doll was<br/>looked after by a medium. The village's gruesome<br/>customs mandated that those close to the medium<br/>were to be offered as sacrifices.")
('System', 'These sacrifices spared no one. Not friends<br/>nor family. Though soon, tragedy befell the village,<br/>leaving Olympia and the doll alone to wander the<br/>continent after the demise of all they knew.')
('System', 'Multiple records suggest instances of criminals being<br/>slaughtered when encroaching on the wandering pair.')
('System', "She was later inducted into the Gardens—the assassin<br/>organization—and made overseer of the Garden<br/>of Aurum. Though it appears she's been mostly left to<br/>her own devices after being invited by the other<br/>overseers, these including Melchior and the Emperor.")
('System', 'If I were to guess, the incident that took place in her<br/>village led to her and the angel developing a<br/>psychologically interdependent relationship, resulting<br/>in her autonomy and emotional<br/>expression diminishing.')
('System', "In light of the crisis that's made the Gardens join<br/>forces, she may have a chance to reclaim that lost<br/>capacity, albeit an incredibly slim one.")
('System', "Arioch     Gender: Male, Age: Over 150?<br/>In contrast to the known, confirmed leaders of Almata and<br/>Garden overseers, eyewitness reports of him are few. What we<br/>do know of him, the Garden of Rust's overseer, is that he's<br/>a very dangerous man, clad in heavy armor.")
('System', 'Much of the information about him stretches belief,<br/>including how he was supposedly born in a different<br/>time period altogether, over 150 years ago.')
('System', "If he was, he's said to proceed from the mythical Holy<br/>Iskan Empire, an enormous nation believed to have<br/>laid just across the Tianshan and Ishgal Mountains to<br/>Calvard's east. This empire is presumed to have<br/>vanished following a calamity 130 years ago.")
('System', 'In its heyday, nine groups served to protect the royal<br/>imperial line. Eastern sources indicate that he was a<br/>warrior who represented the Rahu, a tribe of white<br/>descent hailing from the West.')
('System', "I'm inclined to believe it's all bullshit. But in an age<br/>where Immortals like the Lance Maiden can exist in<br/>Erebonia, I can't rule out the possibility of there being<br/>some truth to it, either.")
('System', "Whether it's true or not, evidence might suggest that<br/>his armor and his strangely shaped battle axe might<br/>be artifacts. Considering his joining the Gardens and<br/>the stories claiming his immortality, this might be<br/>highly likely.")
('System', "On top of that, he's the primary suspect regarding the<br/>Eisenschild's annihilation in the outskirts of Creil,<br/>though I still can't state that for a fact.<br/>More information's needed.")
('System', "Melchior     Gender: Male, Age: 21<br/>One of Almata's three pillars, and quite possibly its most<br/>evil and sinister member. He doubles down as the Gardens'<br/>ringleader and overseer of the Garden of Thorns.")
('System', "Melchior's skills don't fall behind any of his<br/>artifact-wielding peers, being highly skilled in the use<br/>of the orbal net and being capable of infinitely<br/>spawning and freely controlling explosives.<br/>Beyond that, he also acts as Almata's main strategist<br/>and Dantès' righthand man and confidant (and<br/>possibly his lover).")
('System', "Though his past is shrouded in mystery, his origins<br/>might trace back to the same organization the<br/>Oathbreaker, one of Ouroboros' Anguis, also<br/>comes from.")
('System', "The Order of the Moonlight Horse existed since the<br/>Middle Ages, where the Oathbreaker sat among its<br/>top brass for the longest time before losing to<br/>Ouroboros and switching sides. He's an entirely<br/>different matter, and a major threat all of his own.")
('System', "Wrapping this back around, Melchior might've been<br/>a direct subordinate of the Oathbreaker before going<br/>on to take in the scattered remnants of that<br/>infamous cult.")
('System', "If that's true, that would make him something of a<br/>prince of the underworld.")
('System', 'For someone as powerful as him to idolize Dantès so<br/>much is nothing short of ominous and concerning, to<br/>say the least.')
('System', "Another thing that concerns me is him staying in<br/>Creil's vicinity following the Eisenschild turning<br/>into ghouls.")
('System', "Creil's not just some sleepy village with<br/>beautiful vistas. More than a touristic spot, it lies<br/>stuck between several forces working from<br/>the shadows. It also happens to be one of the few<br/>places in northern Calvard with a sizable Eastern and<br/>Central Eastern population.")
('System', "Knowing the source of Almata's financing...<br/>Actually, I'd rather not speculate any further.")
('System', "Gerard Dantès     Gender: Male, Age: 34<br/>If I let my feelings take way, Dantès could fill every single<br/>page in this notebook. There's not a night where I'm not<br/>overcome with regret, but this notebook is not meant for my<br/>personal thoughts.")
('System', "Most things I've come to learn about him and his life<br/>are at least a little eyebrow-raising. Him being a<br/>member of the D∴G cult before joining Almata.<br/>Being related to Calvard's old royal family—perhaps<br/>even a direct descendant.")
('System', "The tales of his sword are equally as hard to believe.<br/>A gigantic blade of black and silver, thought to be an<br/>artifact hidden by the royal family. This demon blade<br/>was the instrument with which he slew Enrique,<br/>Almata's previous head.")
('System', 'Hard as these tales are to believe, their true purpose is<br/>to strike fear into the hearts of those who hear them.<br/>To make Dantès nothing short of the living<br/>manifestation of shadows and agony.')
('System', 'Deep as the abyss and equally as alluring, his<br/>unquenchable thirst for fear is what draws many<br/>to him. Seductive and enchanting, it has earned him<br/>many loyal followers.')
('System', 'But where does such unfathomable hunger<br/>come from?')
('System', "A new hypothesis surfaced recently, which might<br/>finally explain things. Its source, however, is a little<br/>unusual, and I'm not particularly keen to take it at<br/>face value.")
('System', "But that's neither here nor there. The more pressing<br/>matter is his goal in Basel, and that him and the<br/>others might've been after something else.")
('System', "His true goal, I imagine. Fear. The want and need to<br/>bring about true dread and terror to the masses.<br/>He wasn't able to achieve it even with the help of a<br/>genius, but that will not put a stop to him. He'll stop<br/>at nothing to achieve his mission. Looking into this<br/>matter should take priority.")
('System', "Regardless, he sure managed to pull a fast one on me<br/>in Tharbad. I was distracted by that call, but that's<br/>no excuse. I should've seen through him much sooner<br/>than I did. But try as he might to stay one step ahead,<br/>I'll forever be hot on his heels.")
('Dingo', "At this point, I've worked out how I'm going to get<br/>everything recorded, as well as how to leave these<br/>notes behind.")
('Dingo', "Now comes the real showdown with him. It's going<br/>to be the biggest gamble I make as both a reporter<br/>and an information dealer.")
('Dingo', "If, by some sheer miracle, I make it back in one piece,<br/>I'll absolutely be following up on those theories I've<br/>written about.")
('Dingo', "I can already imagine the hell I'm in for with that<br/>dope of a spriggan and that cub reporter—I really do<br/>worry about her—but you know what?")
('Dingo', "At the end of the day, that's just part of the fun.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Dingo... Dingo!')
('Van', "You dumbass... Who's the real dope between us, huh?")
('Aaron', 'This dude was totally nuts. How the hell did he find<br/>it in him to go that far?')
('Risette', 'I can only imagine his love and care for others<br/>spurring him on to gather this much information.')
('Agnès', 'He was both a clever and kind man.')
('Judith', "And he wasn't just trying to make amends or settle<br/>a score. I don't doubt he genuinely worried for<br/>everyone's future.")
('Bergard', "It goes without saying, but it's a true shame. He was<br/>taken from us far too young.")
('Feri', "*sniffle* I'm so glad you two were able to find<br/>his notes.")
('Quatre', "Likewise. It must've been the will of the Goddess.")
('System', 'Once Marielle collected herself, the party drove her<br/>back to the Tyrell Times.')
('System', 'After reporting their success to editor-in-chief<br/>Cunning, they got back to work.')
('System', "As for Dingo's notes, once the contents were copied,<br/>it was decided that Marielle would hold on to the<br/>originals for safekeeping.")
('System', "Quest Dingo's Legacy completed!")
('System', 'Earned')
('System', 'Received')
('Van', "You're Zora, right? The one who put the call out<br/>for us? We're with Arkride Solutions. Nice to<br/>meet you.")
('Zora', 'Oh, wonderful! Thank you so much for coming!')
('Zora', "Please, have a seat. I'll get some tea ready in just<br/>a minute.")
('Zora', 'I was curious what a spriggan would be like,<br/>you know.')
('Zora', "But you look just like normal people. I might've even<br/>seen you around town before.")
('Van', 'You probably have. Our office is in Old Town.')
('Van', "I know some stuff about you and your son.<br/>He's studying for high school entrance exams, right?")
('Zora', "Wow, you weren't kidding! You really do know<br/>about us!")
('Zora', "But you're right. We're hoping he'll be able to get<br/>into Aramis Academy, so I've been having him<br/>rigorously study every day.")
('Zora', 'His grades were in a bit of a rut for a while, but they<br/>have thankfully started improving.')
('Zora', "Not that I ever doubted him, of course. He's my son,<br/>so of course he's capable!")
('Zora', 'If he keeps this up, he surely will nail a spot in the<br/>academy at the tippy top of his class! ♪')
('Judith', "(Mom's real, er, passionate about her<br/>kid's education...)")
('Quatre', "(I don't think it's inherently wrong to want your child<br/>to succeed, but she might be taking it a bit too far...)")
('Risette', '(Hmm...)')
('Zora', "But right as he's starting to show some promise, the<br/>situation turns dire. Curtis has been behaving really<br/>strange as of late.")
('Zora', "He's become violent all of a sudden. Yelling really<br/>loudly, hitting things.")
('Feri', "And he's never done that before?")
('Bergard', 'I can see why you would be concerned.')
('Zora', "Never in his life! He's always been a good boy.<br/>He must be in some awful company if he's acting<br/>this way! That's the most logical explanation!")
('Zora', "I take my eyes off him for a moment, and<br/>this happens... That's why I need you. Please, figure<br/>out what happened to my precious Curtis!")
('Aaron', "(So what if he's gotten a little sassy? I'd wanna curse<br/>myself mute if I was getting choked like this 24/7.)")
('Agnès', "(Really? I don't think it would hurt to look around a<br/>little and make sure he isn't falling in with a bad<br/>crowd, just to be safe.)")
('Feri', 'What do you think, Van? Should we help her?')
('Zora', 'My son Curtis has started to act violently all of<br/>a sudden.')
('Zora', "I'm worried he's made some bad friends right as his<br/>grades have started to show real promise.")
('Zora', 'I need you to find out what happened to him when I<br/>took my eyes off him.')
('Feri', 'What do you think, Van? Should we help her?')
('Van', 'Maybe... Give me a minute to think about it.')
('Van', "I'm willin' to help, but we need to get some stuff<br/>done beforehand.")
('Van', "You okay waitin' a bit?")
('Zora', "*sigh* I'd rather not, but I can if I must. Don't let me<br/>keep you.")
('Van', "All right, we'll take the case.")
('Zora', 'Fantastic! Thank you so much.')
('Agnès', "If you don't mind me asking, ma'am, where is Curtis<br/>right now?")
('Zora', "He's out buying some reference material.")
('Zora', "There's a book store in the Tyrell District we like to<br/>shop at. I imagine he's there.")
('Van', "Oh, so he's out right now. Perfect.")
('Van', 'Before we start with anything else, mind if we search<br/>his room?')
('Van', "I ain't too hot on diggin' through a teen's room like<br/>that, but it's the most obvious place to start lookin'.")
('Zora', 'I understand. You can search his room. Follow<br/>me upstairs.')
('Aaron', "Bet you anything he's got all the good dirty mags<br/>hidden under his mattress.")
('Van', 'How did I know you were gonna say that?')
('System', 'Quest Problem Child started!')
('Zora', "Here you are. This is Curtis' room.")
('Van', "Thanks for showing us. All right, let's get this done<br/>before the kid's back home.")
('System', "Van and the rest started combing through<br/>Curtis' bedroom.")
('System', 'At first, they found nothing of note that could<br/>plausibly explain his violent turn in behavior.')
('System', 'The only objects kept hidden were mock exams with<br/>failing scores.')
('System', 'But a few minutes later...')
('Van', 'Well, look at that.')
('Agnès', 'Did you find something, Van?')
('Van', 'You bet. Take a look at what I found tucked away<br/>inside the desk drawer.')
('Feri', 'A mint tin? It looks empty.')
('Zora', "I don't think I recognize the brand. Could you<br/>explain what it is?")
('Aaron', "They sell tobacco-flavored mints inside these suckers.<br/>You only get them if you're smoking or trying to quit.")
('Aaron', "That would explain why it doesn't smell like cigs<br/>in here. He could've been chewing on those instead of<br/>lighting one up.")
('Zora', 'They taste like WHAT?!')
('Zora', 'They might not be the real thing, but only<br/>delinquents even THINK about smoking at his age!')
('Zora', 'Oh, my poor Curtis. Where did I go wrong with you?<br/>I thought I raised you to be such a good boy...')
('Agnès', "Let's not get ahead of ourselves. We might be missing<br/>something that explains why he had this tin.")
('Zora', "I know EXACTLY why he had it! It's all my<br/>husband's fault! Him and that scandal of his that got<br/>him demoted from the Bank of Edith.")
('Zora', "We were forced to move into Old Town because<br/>of that. If we were living in a safer neighborhood, my<br/>son wouldn't be straying from the path!")
('Zora', 'My husband was supposed to start working at a<br/>subsidiary once he was out of probation.')
('Zora', 'But where do I end up finding him instead?<br/>Montmart! I caught him eating there AGAIN<br/>without a care in the world while I was out shopping.')
('Zora', "Absolutely ridiculous! Has he been working this<br/>whole time, or just pulling the wool over my eyes?<br/>I can't trust him anymore. Would you?")
('Feri', 'Wow... She just keeps going.')
('Van', "*sigh* Anyway, this tin gives us a good jumping<br/>off point. We'll keep sniffin' around and see what we<br/>turn up.")
('Zora', "*ahem* Pardon my outburst. I'll leave you all to it.<br/>I'll be waiting for your report downstairs.")
('Agnès', "What's the matter, Van? Did you notice<br/>something else?")
('Van', "Yeah. The tin still stinks. It's faint, but you can still<br/>get a whiff if you get real close to it.")
('Van', "It smells just like an orbal hookah. Feels like a<br/>lifetime ago, but I'd recognize that smell anywhere.")
('Agnès', 'What? Really?!')
('Aaron', 'And here I thought we were finally done with<br/>that bullshit.')
('Quatre', 'I remember you telling me about that case. Hmm...')
('Judith', "I don't know if I'm more surprised by the orbal<br/>hookahs coming back OR that hound's nose of yours<br/>picking up the smell.")
('Risette', "I don't doubt Mr. Arkride's right about it, but the<br/>CID and the police were supposed to have<br/>confiscated all of them.")
('Bergard', 'You mean the drug that A developed and peddled<br/>through Vegas Films?')
('Feri', "I don't remember hearing about that stuff coming<br/>in tablets.")
('Feri', 'Where did he get something like that?')
('Agnès', 'I worry for how his health might be affected...')
('Aaron', "All right, chief. What's the plan? Do we go straight<br/>to the kid and get him to spill?")
('Van', 'No. We need to figure out where these things came<br/>from in the first place.')
('Van', 'Right now, this stays between us. Nothing good can<br/>come of his mom catching wind of this.')
('Aaron', 'With a firecracker of a mom like that, I can<br/>only imagine.')
('Feri', "Since we're talking about tobacco-flavored mints,<br/>maybe a cigarette seller would know something.")
('Agnès', 'If his father smokes, too, that could also<br/>lead somewhere.')
('Van', 'Agreed. Might as well look into both of those.')
('Van', 'The mom said something about her husband eating<br/>at Montmart.')
('Van', 'Got a minute? We want to ask something about<br/>your son.')
('System', "Van explained the request from Roman's wife and<br/>summarized the team's findings thus far.")
('Roman', 'What?! My son is chewing on<br/>tobacco-flavored mints?!')
('Roman', "I can't believe it. He's never been the brightest at<br/>school, but I didn't think he'd be THAT stupid!")
('Agnès', 'S-Sir, please, calm down.')
('Van', 'As an aside, do you smoke at all yourself?')
('Roman', 'Goddess, no.')
('Roman', 'Why would I? The smell would only make our<br/>clients uncomfortable.')
('Feri', 'Then do you have any idea why Curtis would be<br/>taking those tablets? Any idea at all?')
('Roman', "Oh, I know what's going on with him!")
('Roman', 'Boy must be getting lazy. Tired of studying for<br/>entrance exams, so he must be taking them as<br/>a distraction.')
('Roman', "What an embarrassment. He's getting real spoiled if<br/>he thinks he can get away with all of this nonsense.")
('Roman', "When I was his age, I was so focused on my studies, I<br/>didn't even eat or sleep!")
('Roman', 'Just what in Gehenna is Zora doing raising our son<br/>for him to turn out like that?!')
('Judith', "(What's his problem?! I get that he's mad, but he's<br/>still the kid's dad!)")
('Bergard', '(Hmm... It sounds like the parents themselves have<br/>some issues to work through.)')
('Aaron', '(With parents like these, kid was gonna start acting<br/>out sooner or later.)')
('Van', "Thanks for the info. We'll get outta your hair now.")
('Agnès', "Well, that's both people on our list.")
('Aaron', "And none of it helped. Dad didn't really tell us<br/>anything new about the kid, and we got no info to go<br/>on about those mints.")
('Van', "Guess the last stop's that bookstore his<br/>mom mentioned.")
('Van', "He might not even be there, but it can't hurt to talk<br/>to him if he is.")
('Feri', "If he's not, we can always ask the staff. They might<br/>know something!")
('Van', 'Sorry to interrupt your class. Can we have a<br/>quick chat?')
('Van', "We wanted to ask about a kid we've been hired to<br/>look into. Name's Curtis.")
('Gin', "*sigh* Of all the times... I guess we can if it really<br/>can't wait.")
('Gin', "Let's go somewhere else.")
('System', "Van explained the request he and the others received<br/>from Curtis' mother.")
('System', 'They also explained his stark change in personality.')
('Gin', 'Right, okay.')
('Gin', "Not gonna lie, I think his parents are making a storm<br/>in a teacup. Kid's not gonna turn into some hardened<br/>criminal because of this.")
('Gin', "But to answer your question, I do know who you're<br/>talking about. He came to my tobacco kiosk about<br/>an hour ago.")
('Feri', 'He did?!')
('Gin', 'Yeah. He asked if I had any tobacco-flavored mints<br/>for sale.')
('Gin', "I told him I don't sell them and that, even if I did, a<br/>kid like him shouldn't go anywhere near them.")
('Gin', 'He got all huffy and started yelling. Called me an old<br/>hag, which was nice of him.')
('Agnès', "Wow... I'm so sorry you had to deal with that.")
('Van', "Damn, kid's got balls to say that to your face.<br/>What'd he do after that?")
('Gin', 'Beats me. My guess is he went looking for some other<br/>place he could sucker into selling him those mints.')
('Van', 'Makes sense. Thanks for the info.')
('Agnès', "Well, that's both people on our list.")
('Aaron', "And none of it helped. Dad didn't really tell us<br/>anything new about the kid, and we got no info to go<br/>on about those mints.")
('Van', "Guess the last stop's that bookstore his<br/>mom mentioned.")
('Van', "He might not even be there, but it can't hurt to talk<br/>to him if he is.")
('Feri', "If he's not, we can always ask the staff. They might<br/>know something!")
('Van', "Okay. Now that everyone's here, we can get started.")
('Zora', 'Well, what did you find? Was I right? Has Curtis<br/>made some bad friends?')
('Roman', "Bah, I'm sure it's just a typical rebellious teen phase.")
('Curtis', '...')
('Van', "Let's go over what we found and then we can take<br/>things from there.")
('System', 'Van began by discussing how Curtis bought the<br/>tobacco-flavored mints from a dealer on a whim.')
('System', 'Curtis soon had developed a dependency on them,<br/>since his academics improved when he used them.')
('System', 'Van also brought up how the mints were laced<br/>with drugs.')
('System', 'Though the side effects were light, Curtis soon<br/>started taking prescription medicine, thinking it<br/>would cure him.')
('Zora', '*sigh* This is all so much to take in. I feel so dizzy<br/>simply thinking about it...')
('Zora', "To think my own son would be taking<br/>prescription drugs! He's even worse than I<br/>could've imagined.")
('Zora', "I'm very disappointed in you! Is this the<br/>thanks I get? After supporting you and<br/>your studies unconditionally?!")
('Zora', 'What do you have to say for yourself,<br/>young man?!')
('Roman', 'Keep it down, will you? Or do you want the<br/>neighbors to hear you?')
('Roman', 'As for you... Did you forget that your father just<br/>started working again?')
('Roman', "I don't have time for this nonsense, and yet here<br/>you are! Causing me nothing but problems, as if I<br/>don't have enough on my plate already!")
('Roman', "I practically had to beg for some time off work to<br/>come have this conversation with you. Are you even<br/>aware of what I'm going through?!")
('Curtis', "...I'm sorry.")
('Van', "*sigh* I'm honestly surprised at the total lack of<br/>shame here.")
('Zora', "So am I! Are you actually sorry for what you've put us<br/>through, young man?!")
('Roman', "I trust the police aren't going to have to get involved<br/>at this point?")
('Roman', 'The last thing I need is for my son to get arrested.<br/>Now THAT will really get me fired.')
('Van', "No, you two got it all wrong. He's not the one that<br/>should be ashamed—it's you two. You should<br/>be mortified.")
('Van', "Though I guess that's up to you. Can't force either of<br/>you to feel guilty.")
('Zora', 'G-GUILTY?! What should I even feel<br/>guilty for?!')
('Roman', "Don't try to change the subject! Curtis is the one<br/>that's acting like a delinquent! This isn't about us!")
('Aaron', 'Heh, on the contrary. This is all about you folks.')
('Aaron', "Or did you forget already? You asked us to figure out<br/>why your kid changed. We're serving you the answer<br/>on a silver platter.")
('Agnès', 'Curtis was hitting a dead-end with his studies and felt<br/>like he was being driven into a corner.')
('Zora', '...That may be true. But I fail to see what that has to<br/>do with either of us.')
('Van', "Since you're not gettin' it, I'll spell it out for you.<br/>Your son didn't fall in with a bad crowd or change<br/>because of some damned mints.")
('Van', "It's all his parents' fault. A neglectful pair that failed<br/>to notice what he was going through. Or maybe you<br/>just didn't want to.")
('Roman', "I knew I wouldn't like where this conversation<br/>was headed. Where did I fail as a father, huh?!")
('Feri', 'Have you two ever stopped to think about how<br/>Curtis feels?')
('Feri', "I don't know everything about your family, but it<br/>looks like you two only worry about what you want<br/>for him, and not what he wants.")
('Curtis', '...')
('Zora', 'And who are you, thinking you can tell us how to run<br/>our family?!')
('Zora', "You don't have the slightest idea of how hard I've<br/>worked for this! All so Curtis could get into a<br/>prestigious high school. His future would be set!")
('Roman', "Exactly! Do you know how much money I've spent<br/>on his textbooks and mock tests?! I've done all that,<br/>despite my work situation!")
('Van', "(This conversation's gettin' nowhere, and fast.<br/>Should've known they wouldn't listen.)")
('Van', "(It'd feel wrong bailing out and leavin' the kid out to<br/>dry, though.)")
('Van', "(Not really my style, but I guess it's time for a little<br/>marriage counseling.)")
('Van', '(Maybe talking about their family bonds will get<br/>these two to snap out of it.)')
('Van', 'Has it even crossed your mind just WHY your son<br/>was so desperate with his studies?')
('Van', "Who knows, maybe I'm talking out of my ass, but<br/>shit looks like he was just trying to live up to those<br/>lofty expectations of yours.")
('Curtis', "Th-That's not why!")
('Curtis', 'I... I just thought...a good student should go to a<br/>prestigious school...')
('Van', 'And then you hit a brick wall.')
('Van', "So that's when you started turning to those mints to<br/>get into Aramis.")
('Van', 'At the end of the day, is that what you wanted?')
('Curtis', 'I mean...')
('Van', 'Sounds to me like what you really wanted was to not<br/>let your folks down. You put in all the effort so they<br/>would finally acknowledge you.')
('Zora', "I... I don't know what to say...")
('Van', "And while your son's bustin' his back to succeed,<br/>what support did he have?")
('Van', 'He had a mother that twisted her love and affection<br/>for her child into a leash.')
('Van', "And a father acting only for his own<br/>self-righteousness, without ever stoppin' to look back<br/>at his family. Honestly, none of you ever did.")
('Van', "You two don't know the first thing about takin' care<br/>of a kid if you think this sad excuse for parenting's the<br/>best way to raise him.")
('Roman', '...')
('Zora', "*sniffle* I'm so sorry.")
('Zora', 'I wanted to support you, but it turns out all I was<br/>doing was burdening you even more.')
('Zora', "I might've let it get to my head, having so much<br/>power over managing your life.")
('Zora', "I failed you as a mother. I should've believed in you,<br/>and I didn't.")
('Roman', "I'm also sorry, son. I thought it was my job as the man<br/>of the house to provide for my family, and that it was<br/>your mother's job to raise you instead.")
('Roman', "When I was demoted at work, I thought I'd failed<br/>you all.")
('Roman', "But that's not when this all started. It began with me<br/>neglecting you, and what really should've been my<br/>role within this family.")
('Curtis', 'Dad... Mom...')
('Roman', "I think it's time for us three to sit down and talk, as<br/>a family. Talk and figure out where we went wrong,<br/>and how to fix things.")
('Zora', "*sniffle* You're right. It's time we stopped running<br/>from reality and started trying to work together.")
('Curtis', 'Yeah, I guess so... We really do need to talk.')
('Van', "(Maybe a little shock therapy's in order. Let's see<br/>what they think if I tell them they oughta split.)")
('Van', "Dunno if this is the best time to bring it up, but from<br/>where I'm sitting, things look kinda hopeless for<br/>this family.")
('Van', "If this is how things will keep on goin' between you<br/>two, the one that's gonna come out losing the most is<br/>your son.")
('Van', "I'll be frank. At this point, everyone might be better<br/>off if you get divorced.")
('Curtis', "What?! No! I don't want Mom and Dad to get a<br/>divorce because of me! That's going too far!")
('Curtis', 'Right, Mom? Dad?!')
('Zora', '...')
('Roman', "I won't deny our home life isn't exactly happy.")
('Roman', "Tell us the truth, son. You're fed up with me and your<br/>mother, aren't you?")
('Curtis', "...! Th-That's... I...")
('Zora', "*sigh* I didn't mean for things to turn out this way...")
('Zora', 'I thought that, even if it took hard work, it would be<br/>smooth sailing after Curtis made it into Aramis.<br/>That his future would be set.')
('Zora', 'But the more I think about it, I was just forcing him<br/>to do what I wanted and what would make ME<br/>happy, not him...')
('Curtis', 'Mom...')
('Roman', "It's my fault, too. I left your mother alone to deal with<br/>everything regarding the household.")
('Roman', "I didn't realize that you felt so trapped, son.")
('Roman', "No... That's not it. I didn't even make the effort to<br/>understand how you felt.")
('Roman', 'I failed as your father.')
('Curtis', 'Dad...')
('Van', "So, what'll it be? You gonna give up? Cut your<br/>marriage loose?")
('Zora', "*sniffle* No, I don't want to!")
('Zora', "Yes, we've not seen each other eye to eye for a while,<br/>but that's no reason to throw it all away. We've come<br/>so far as a family!")
('Roman', "Not sure it's just been 'a while'...")
('Roman', "But I'm not ready to throw in the towel, either.<br/>I want to make amends, even if I still have a lot to<br/>think about.")
('Roman', "You're my family, after all. I think it's time for us<br/>three to sit down and talk. Talk and figure out where<br/>we went wrong, and how to fix things.")
('Zora', "*sniffle* Yes, I think that's what we need.")
('Curtis', 'Okay...')
('Agnès', '(Phew. Glad things have finally calmed down.)')
('Quatre', "(You sure didn't pull your punches, Van.)")
('Judith', '(You had me on the edge of my seat the whole time!)')
('Risette', "(I sincerely hope the conversation they'll have once<br/>we leave proves to be a fruitful one.)")
('Bergard', '(That was some fine work defusing the situation.<br/>No one does it quite like you, Van.)')
('Van', "(Nah, it wasn't anything special. Just did what I felt<br/>was needed to turn things around.)")
('Van', "I don't got anything else to add here. The rest is up<br/>to you.")
('Van', "And don't worry about the whole drug deal.<br/>We'll take care of it discreetly so it doesn't<br/>become public.")
('Van', "We'll get out of your hair now. Good luck y'all.")
('System', 'Quest Problem Child completed!')
('System', 'Received')
('Van', "The hell's this? 'Dear spriggan'?")
('Van', "Hmm... Doesn't look suspicious, at least. All right—<br/>my interest is piqued.")
('Van', "I guess this message here must be the code it was<br/>tellin' me to look into.")
('System', "'First task: Go to the stable along the river upon<br/>which the injured iron steeds descend.'")
('Van', 'Hmm... Seems innocent enough.')
('Van', "Dunno what they're after, but I'll play along for a bit<br/>and see what's up.")
('Raymond', 'Hey, Van. Thanks for coming.')
('Van', "Sure thing. Figured I'd hear you out at least.")
('Van', 'You wrote that Jess has disappeared, right?')
('Raymond', 'Uh, yeah.')
('Raymond', "You know who he is, don't you?")
('Van', 'Yeah. We cross paths at the station from time<br/>to time.')
('Van', 'Did a small job for him a while back, too.')
('Raymond', "Oh, interesting. I didn't know that.")
('Van', 'Yeah. We cross paths at the station from time<br/>to time.')
('Van', 'Just like you and I, really.')
('Raymond', 'Haha, I guess we do, now that you mention it.')
('Van', 'Anyway, when did he go missing?')
('Raymond', 'He was already gone when I woke up this morning.')
('Raymond', 'I went into his room to check in on him, but found<br/>this note there instead.')
('System', 'I know this is sudden, but I have to leave. The longer<br/>things go on, the harder it is for me to bear it.')
('System', "And don't worry about holding on to my things.<br/>You can go ahead and get rid of them. Thanks for<br/>everything, and sorry for all the trouble. Goodbye.")
('Van', 'All right.')
('Van', "From the looks of it, none of y'all were expectin' this?")
('Raymond', "No. He'd never said anything about leaving.")
('Raymond', 'We were having dinner just fine with my sister just<br/>last night.')
('Agnès', "Has anything unusual happened when you've all<br/>been together?")
('Feri', 'Did anything weird happen to you guys?')
('Aaron', 'Anything weird happen while you guys were chilling?')
('Risette', 'Has anything strange occurred while you<br/>were together?')
('Quatre', 'Anything odd stick out to you lately?')
('Judith', 'You guys spend a lot of time together, yeah?<br/>Did something weird happen?')
('Bergard', 'Has anything unusual happen to you lately?')
('Raymond', 'Let me think...')
('Raymond', 'You know, things did feel a little awkward between<br/>him and my sister.')
('Raymond', 'Something else happened that stuck out to me, yeah.')
('Van', "Mind sharin'?")
('Raymond', 'Sure. It was three days ago.')
('Raymond', 'Jess was gonna have a nighttime show over at<br/>Riverside, so I went to check it out.')
('Raymond', 'But he never showed up to it. They had to cancel.')
('Van', "He bailed out on a gig at the last minute? That<br/>ain't normal.")
('Raymond', "Yeah, he'd never done that before.")
('Raymond', "I asked him what happened the next day, but he<br/>wouldn't answer me.")
('Raymond', "Everything else was fine so I didn't bring it up again.")
('Agnès', 'Then he disappeared this morning.')
('Feri', 'But you woke up today and he was gone.')
('Aaron', 'But he up and vanished this morning, eh?')
('Risette', "Then you woke up this morning and he'd vanished.")
('Quatre', 'And when you tried checking in on him this<br/>morning, he was already gone.')
('Judith', 'But he bailed out on you, too, this morning.')
('Bergard', 'And by this morning, he had already departed.')
('Van', "Well, at least it doesn't look like anything<br/>illegal happened.")
('Raymond', "Yeah. And I didn't think it was worth bothering the<br/>guild over it.")
('Raymond', 'Instead, I took some time off work today to look<br/>for him.')
('Raymond', "I've been everywhere I thought he might've gone to,<br/>but no luck.")
('Raymond', "I don't think I can do this by myself.")
('Raymond', "That's why I decided to ask you guys for help.<br/>You've got a good rep of doing good by your clients.")
('Van', 'Yeah, makes sense. I think I got a good grasp on this<br/>whole shtick now.')
('Raymond', "In that case, will you help look for him? I'm not<br/>trying to pressure you.")
('Raymond', '*sigh* Jess... Where are you?')
('Raymond', "I'm not trying to pressure you Van, but...could you<br/>help look for him? You'd be doing me a big favor.")
('Van', 'Sure, we can pitch in.')
('Raymond', "Oh, I'm so glad. Thank you!")
('Van', 'I hate to ask, but can you give me some time to think<br/>it over?')
('Raymond', "That's fine. I imagine you're really busy. Don't feel<br/>obligated to if you can't.")
('Raymond', "But if you do have time to help, you'd be doing me a<br/>big favor.")
('Van', "Not to change the subject, but didn't you and Jess<br/>grow up together?")
('Raymond', "Uh-huh. We're both from Anchorville. We've been<br/>friends since we were kids.")
('Raymond', 'My sister and I decided to move to Edith after he<br/>made his big break.')
('Raymond', "I thought things were back to how they used to be<br/>when we were kids. But now... Now I don't know<br/>what to think.")
('Van', "Your sister's name is Carol, right?")
('Van', "And she's not looking for him?")
('Raymond', "I don't know. Don't think so. I told her about it,<br/>obviously, but she didn't want to help me.")
('Raymond', 'She should be at her job, like usual. Works in the<br/>boutique over in the Seiden District.')
('Raymond', "Something must've happened between her and Jess<br/>for her to be acting like that.")
('Raymond', 'I feel a little guilty not having a clue what it<br/>is, though...')
('Van', 'Sometimes stuff just happens. All we can do now is<br/>look for him.')
('Van', 'Do you know who else was friends with Jess aside<br/>from Carol?')
('Raymond', 'The only other person I can think of off the top of<br/>my head is his manager.')
('Raymond', "I don't how to reach her, but Carol probably does.")
('Van', "Got it. Thanks for sharin'.")
('Van', "Don't worry about lookin' for him anymore.<br/>We'll take it from here.")
('Agnès', "We'd appreciate it if you waited here.")
('Feri', 'You can wait here while we look!')
('Aaron', "Keep yourself comfy and we'll be back with news<br/>before you know it.")
('Risette', "In the meantime, if you could please wait here, we'd<br/>sincerely appreciate it.")
('Quatre', "It'd be good if you could wait here while we looked.")
('Judith', "Hang in there! Wait here, and we'll do our best to<br/>find him!")
('Bergard', "Wait here. We'll be sure to bring back good news.")
('Raymond', "Okay, I'll do that. Thanks again, you guys.")
('Van', "All right. First stop: Raymond's sister, Carol.<br/>Let's see what she's got to say 'bout all this.")
('Van', "All right. First stop: Raymond's sister, Carol.<br/>Let's see what she's got to say 'bout all this.")
('Agnès', "He mentioned she was in the boutique in the<br/>Seiden District. I think it's called Erland.")
('Feri', 'I think he said something about a boutique in Seiden?<br/>Erland, maybe?')
('Aaron', 'Dude said she was at her boutique job, over in Seiden.<br/>I think that place is called Erland.')
('Risette', "I believe he mentioned his sister working in Erland.<br/>That's the boutique in the Seiden District.")
('Quatre', 'Maybe we should start by going to that boutique in<br/>the Seiden District he talked about. Erland, I believe.')
('Judith', 'He said she was working in a boutique in the<br/>Seiden District. Only one I know of is Erland.')
('Bergard', "He said she's at her job in the boutique in the<br/>Seiden District. It must be Erland.")
('System', 'Quest Missing Friend started!')
('Raymond', 'He said he was going out of town to see his<br/>favorite flower?')
('Van', "That's what we heard. Any idea what that might be?")
('Raymond', 'Yeah, think so.')
('Raymond', 'He was probably talking about white daisies.')
('Van', 'Huh. Not really that rare a flower.')
('Raymond', "They're really common in our hometown.<br/>Anchorville is full of them.")
('Raymond', 'Jess, Carol, and I would go out to the fields and look<br/>at them all the time.')
('Raymond', "Though you can't really find any natural fields like<br/>that out here in Edith. The only ones here<br/>are cultivated.")
('Van', 'Huh. Who knew?')
('Agnès', 'Why do the three of you like white daisies<br/>in particular?')
('Agnès', 'Maybe something specific about them appealed to<br/>you all?')
('Feri', 'Why do you like white daisies so much?')
('Feri', 'Is there a reason why you like white daisies so much?')
('Aaron', 'Why are you all so big on white daisies?')
('Aaron', 'There something special about them?')
('Risette', "If I may, what's so fascinating about white daisies?")
('Risette', 'I wondered if there was a particular reason you<br/>liked them.')
('Quatre', 'Why white daisies?')
('Quatre', 'Is there something special about them that stands out<br/>to you three?')
('Judith', "What's the fascination with white daisies?")
('Judith', 'Why not something else? How come you like them<br/>so much?')
('Bergard', 'What is the fascination with white daisies?')
('Bergard', 'What makes them so special compared to<br/>other flowers?')
('Raymond', "I mean, they're easy on the eyes and smell nice,<br/>for one.")
('Raymond', 'But I guess their true meaning spoke to us. Do you<br/>know what white daisies mean in the language<br/>of flowers?')
('Raymond', "Hidden love. It's pretty poetic, don't you think?")
('Van', 'Yeah, I feel you.')
('Van', "But if that's what they stand for, then I wonder...")
('Van', "Are y'all hiding some sort of hidden love?")
('Raymond', "Haha, I don't know. That might be a stretch.")
('Raymond', "Maybe they appeal to Jess' artistic sensibilities, being<br/>a musician and all.")
('Raymond', "Carol's more of an open book, though.")
('Raymond', 'But now that I think about it...')
('Raymond', 'She might actually be hiding her true feelings.')
('Van', "Well, you're the expert.")
('Van', "Oh, yeah. I don't think she told you about<br/>what happened.")
('Raymond', 'Huh? Something happened?')
('System', "Van told Raymond about Carol and Jess'<br/>confrontation, careful to omit some of the particulars.")
('Raymond', "'Things can't keep going on like this forever'?")
('Raymond', 'She really said that?')
('Agnès', 'She did. She really bore her heart out.')
('Feri', 'Yeah. I guess she really laid it out there.')
('Aaron', 'Sure did. Poor girl spilled her heart out to him.')
('Risette', 'That she did, and in no uncertain terms.')
('Quatre', "Yes. She didn't really suppress her emotions when<br/>talking to him.")
('Judith', 'Uh-huh. Basically spilled her whole heart out.')
('Bergard', "She did. And didn't hold back, from what I gather.")
('Raymond', 'Huh... And what did Jess say?')
('Van', "That he didn't want to ruin his relationship with<br/>you two.")
('Raymond', "That's...a relief, at least?")
('Raymond', 'I feel bad for my sister.')
('Raymond', "I want her happiness more than anything, but that's<br/>just not how things have shaken up.")
('Van', 'To backpedal to the flower thing a little.')
('Van', 'You kinda sidestepped the whole hidden<br/>love discussion. What about you? Got any secrets of<br/>your own?')
('Raymond', 'Me?')
('Raymond', "You're not seriously springing that on me out of the<br/>blue and expecting an answer?")
('Van', "Yeah, that's fair.")
('Raymond', 'I do understand where Jess is coming from...')
('Raymond', 'Not wanting to ruin how things are now and all.')
('Van', '(Hmm...)')
('Van', "Anyway, don't mind me. Let's get back to the topic<br/>at hand.")
('Van', "We know what he's lookin' for, but do you know<br/>where he might've gone to see those flowers?")
('Raymond', 'I think so.')
('Raymond', 'He asked me once if I knew where daisies<br/>grew naturally.')
('Raymond', "I actually didn't have any idea at the time, but my<br/>boss did. Some bloom in the Dirke Memorial<br/>Park forest.")
('Raymond', "Apparently there's a whole bunch of them near<br/>the entrance.")
('Van', 'The forest? You sure about that?')
('Agnès', "That area's restricted, though.")
('Feri', "But that part's sealed off.")
('Aaron', 'That place is closed right now.')
('Risette', 'However, that area is ostensibly closed to the public.')
('Quatre', 'That section has been cordoned off from the public.')
('Judith', "Isn't that area closed off though?")
('Bergard', 'That area is restricted, last I heard.')
('Raymond', 'Believe me, I know.')
('Raymond', "But you'd be surprised how far Jess could go on just<br/>stubbornness alone.")
('Raymond', "I don't doubt he could sneak in there if he wanted to.")
('Van', 'All right.')
('Van', "He shouldn't get attacked by any monsters if he<br/>doesn't wander too far in, but I don't wanna risk it.")
('Raymond', 'Are you going to the park, then? Can you take me<br/>with you?')
('Raymond', 'I understand what happened between Jess and Carol.')
('Raymond', "But I don't see why that meant he had to leave us so<br/>out of nowhere.")
('Raymond', "It just doesn't make sense to me.")
('Raymond', 'I want to talk to him. I need to hear the answers<br/>directly from his mouth.')
('Van', "Sure, why not. If he's not coming back, might as well<br/>take you to him. Let you two smooth things out.")
('Van', "I'll let you know once we're ready to roll.<br/>Sound good?")
('Raymond', 'Sounds great! Thanks, Van!')
('System', "You won't be able to explore the forest in Dirke<br/>Memorial Park until this request is completed.")
('System', "Talk to Raymond once you're ready to go.")
('Raymond', 'Hey, Van. Are we going to the Memorial Park<br/>forest now?')
('Van', "Yep. Let's roll.")
('Van', 'You gonna let your sis know?')
('Raymond', "Yeah. I'll contact her just to let her know what's<br/>going on.")
('System', 'Raymond reached out to Carol before they left to let<br/>her know of everything, but she was too busy to<br/>come immediately.')
('System', 'The group then ventured into the forest after<br/>promising to meet up when Carol had the chance.')
('Van', "(Whoops. Can't forget to bring Agnès before I hit<br/>this place up.)")
('Eddy', "Don't get me wrong, you've got good taste, coming to<br/>me for roasted chestnuts.")
('Eddy', "But are ya really sure those kids'll like these?")
('Van', "I don't see why not. The kids around here love 'em.")
('Eddy', "I guess. But they're not, like, a special occasion kinda<br/>thing, y'know?")
('Eddy', 'Give the chestnut glacé a try. Those might be more<br/>up your alley.')
('Agnès', "Oh, wow. I didn't realize you were selling those, too!")
('Agnès', "We'll gladly take some for our taste-testing, then.")
('Van', "Wow, look at you, Eddy. Playin' the part of<br/>professional salesman for once. I'm legit impressed.")
('Eddy', "Sh-Shut up! I wasn't asking you!")
('Van', "Okay, we've visited all the stores we planned on.")
('Agnès', "We've also got plenty of things to try! Shall we head<br/>back to Odette?")
('Yumé', 'Vaaan! Good morning!')
('Agnès', 'Huh?')
('Van', 'Hey, Yumes. Good to see you. You look ready to take<br/>on the world.')
('Yumé', 'Have you brushed your teeth? Washed your face?<br/>Had breakfast?')
('Yumé', "You better, or else you're in big trouble!")
('Van', "I have, promise. Geez, who's the adult between<br/>us two?")
('Yumé', "Not you! You're too messy! You don't take care<br/>of yourself!")
('Yumé', 'Oh, did you make a new friend?')
('Yumé', 'Hello! Nice to meet you!')
('Agnès', "Heehee. Nice to meet you, too. She's adorable.")
('Van', 'Her family are my neighbors. They run the<br/>bistro here.')
('Paulette', 'Nice to see you again. Glad to see you got to talk to<br/>Van after all.')
('Agnès', 'Oh, I remember you! Yes, thank you for all your<br/>help earlier.')
('Van', 'You two know each other?')
('Agnès', 'Not really. She pointed me toward your office when I<br/>first came here. It was a big help.')
('Paulette', "Heehee, it was nothing. Van's office isn't exactly easy<br/>to find anyway.")
('Paulette', "You're not the first to come looking for directions.")
('Agnès', "I honestly didn't think to look for your office on top<br/>of a restaurant as cozy as this one. That caught me<br/>by surprise.")
('Van', "I wasn't really plannin' on it, but things shook out<br/>like that. Friendly, normal neighbors like these make<br/>for a nice front.")
('Victor', "You could stand to be a better one, y'know! I still<br/>don't like that murky business of yours being right on<br/>top of mine.")
('Van', 'Good to see you, too, Victor.')
('Victor', "I'm not used to seeing you out during the day.<br/>When do you plan on coming—oh. I see you have a<br/>young lady with you today.")
('Victor', "I better not see you try any funny business with<br/>her, understood? Girl that young doesn't need a<br/>ruffian like you ruining her life.")
('Van', "Come on, give me at least a LITTLE credit! I ain't<br/>that much of a degenerate. She's just a normal<br/>client, chill.")
('Agnès', "I don't know about, umm, 'normal,' but he's right.<br/>I came to him first because I have some business I<br/>need his help with.")
('Victor', "Hmm. Things must be complicated, if you're coming<br/>to this idiot for help.")
('Victor', "Van, if you go dragging this lady to any shady alleys<br/>or bad parts of town, I'll have your head on a nice<br/>platter before dinnertime. Are we clear?")
('Yumé', "And don't eat too many sweets! Or you'll get cavities!")
('Victor', "That's exactly right, my sweet little Yumé! We can't<br/>forget that! ❤ ...I said, are we clear? Answer me, punk!")
('Van', "Yeah, yeah, I'll be careful. Don't gotta grill me in<br/>front of a client.")
('Agnès', 'Haha. You and your neighbors look close.')
('Paulette', "It's because we've known each other for a while now.<br/>Anyway, good luck out there! Stay safe!")
('Paulette', "Let us know if you get hungry. We'll get something<br/>for you in no time.")
('Agnès', 'Oh, is this what you were talking about earlier?')
('Van', 'Yep. I usually get requests through bulletin boards<br/>like this one.')
('Van', "They're all over the city, too. Not just in Old Town.")
('Agnès', 'Sure, I see advertisements and messages and other<br/>kinds of information posted on them all the time.')
('Agnès', 'But do people really put in spriggan requests on<br/>them, too?')
('Van', 'Yep, but you gotta know where to look for them.')
('Agnès', 'Was that behind the bulletin board?')
('Van', "Sure was. See how it says '4SPG'? That means<br/>'for spriggan.'")
('Van', 'Been going out of my way to spread rumors about it<br/>so people reach out this way.')
('Van', 'Partly for my own safety, but it also gives me some<br/>breathing room so I can pick and choose which jobs<br/>I take.')
('Van', "To be honest, I don't get clients like you often.<br/>Not many actually bother to track me down.")
('Agnès', "Oh, I didn't know that. I'm sorry if I broke any rules.")
('Van', "Nah, shit's not set in stone. Everyone's different, so<br/>you're fine.")
('Van', "Anyway, let's see what kinda job this is.")
('Agnès', 'They want you to investigate a friend they<br/>caught stealing? So this is what people post about...')
('Van', 'This might just be the perfect gig to get your feet wet<br/>and see how work rolls.')
('Van', "The meeting spot's not far from here at all. Let's go<br/>talk to 'em when we're ready.")
('Agnès', "A-All right. If you're sure.")
('System', 'The To-Do List has now been unlocked.')
('Raymond', 'Hey, Van. Good to see you!')
('Raymond', 'Those new muffins you asked me to put aside turned<br/>out great!')
('Van', 'Awesome! I appreciate you doing that. Can I get<br/>two, then?')
('Raymond', "Sure thing. I'll have them ready in just a minute.")
('Raymond', "Your timing couldn't be more perfect. I've got a new<br/>recipe I wanted you, specifically, to try out.")
('Van', "Oh, yeah? Is this the one I've heard all those<br/>rumors about?")
('Raymond', "It's a sweet muffin made using flower nectar. I'll have<br/>them ready in just a sec.")
('Van', "Awesome. I'll take two.")
('Agnès', "(Wait a minute. Van, you don't think...?)")
('Van', '(Heh. You caught on, did you?)')
('Agnès', '(Then does that mean...?!)')
('Van', "(Let's not get ahead of ourselves. I don't sense<br/>anything suspicious, but we should still be careful.)")
('Raymond', 'Thanks for waiting! I hope you enjoy them. I really<br/>like how they turned out.')
('System', 'Received muffins.')
('Agnès', 'G-Good to know. Thank you for making them.')
('Van', "Let's make our way back to the office now. Best not<br/>to waste too much time out here.")
('Anya', "Hey, Van. Do my eyes deceive me or do I see you've<br/>made yet another new friend?")
('Anya', "And a pretty one at that! Say, since you're here, why<br/>don't you hop in for a little dip? Guaranteed you'll<br/>love it here!")
('Quatre', 'A dip? In what? Oh, wait. This is—')
('Van', "The local bathhouse. I take it they're not that<br/>common in Basel?")
('Van', "This one's real nice. Got a legit sauna and everything.<br/>I can show you how to get the most out of it, if<br/>you're game.")
('Van', "This place is real nice. Got a legit sauna<br/>and everything. I can show you how to get the most<br/>out of it, if you're game.")
('Quatre', "I'm... I'm good, thanks. I just had a shower this<br/>morning, so it's a bit soon to wash up again.")
('Quatre', "Don't let me stop you, though. If the rest of you want<br/>to take a bath, go ahead. I don't mind waiting.")
('Van', "You sure? Shame. I was lookin' forward to inducting<br/>you as an honorary sauna sage.")
('Quatre', "A what? I...don't know if I like the sound of that.")
('Agnès', "According to him, a sauna sage is someone with an<br/>'enlightened' appreciation for saunas. Or something<br/>like that...")
('Feri', 'I think it involves some kinda hamam training?<br/>I dunno.')
('Aaron', "Don't sweat it too much. You'll regret it if you let him<br/>yap your ears off about it. Trust me.")
('Risette', 'Heehee. It is supposedly a practice born in Remiferia,<br/>where saunas originate from.')
('Anya', "Van, knock it off! I know you mean well, but don't go<br/>making my potential future customers uncomfortable!")
('Anya', "Anyway, if you're ever interested in giving this place a<br/>try, new guy, you're more than welcome to come<br/>back anytime.")
('Quatre', 'Uh, right. Thanks. Maybe I will sometime.')
('Quatre', "(Should I? I know what's supposed to happen in these<br/>sorts of places...)")
('Quatre', "I think I'll pass on it for now. I'll just relax out here, if<br/>that's okay.")
('Van', "If you're sure. Would've been nice to have you, but<br/>all right. See ya in a bit.")
('Anya', "Psst! Hey, I've got an idea. You wanna try our<br/>reserved private bath instead?")
('Anya', "It's pretty small, but it still comes with a sauna.<br/>You interested?")
('Quatre', 'Huh? H-How did you know I—')
('Anya', "Heehee, it's Edith. You meet all kinds of people here<br/>with different needs and comfort levels.")
('Anya', "Grandpa and the others built it to cater to people who<br/>might prefer to soak alone, whether it's out of custom<br/>or whatever.")
('Anya', 'What do you say? You in?')
('Quatre', "I...would actually like that, thank you. I'll take you up<br/>on that offer.")
('Van', 'Hey, Paulette. You guys closing up shop for the day?')
('Paulette', 'We are. We had a really good day today. Lots<br/>of customers.')
('Paulette', "But if you want anything, just let me know. We'll still<br/>be open for a bit longer.")
('Van', "Right. I'll let you know. Umm...")
('Paulette', "No need to say anything, Van. It's okay. Thanks for<br/>looking out for me and Yumé. I really appreciate it.")
('Paulette', "It...caught me off guard, seeing him. But I don't<br/>regret it. I'm glad we got to sit down and talk.")
('Van', "All right, if you're sure.")
('Van', "If he starts giving you trouble, let me know and I'll<br/>deal with him.")
('Van', "But it doesn't look like he'll be a nuisance. I<br/>think, anyway. Not from how he was actin', at least,<br/>so maybe I don't gotta worry after all.")
('Paulette', "Thank you, but I don't think you do. He's making<br/>sure to put my and Yumé's feelings first.")
('Van', 'Not to pry, but do she and your old man<br/>know anything?')
('Paulette', 'No, not yet. I plan to talk to them soon.')
('Paulette', "But it won't be an easy conversation to have with<br/>either of them. Especially Yumé. I'm a little worried<br/>about her.")
('Van', "Got'cha. She might be too young for that kinda talk.")
('Paulette', "That's what I'm thinking, too. I might speak with my<br/>dad about it first, but I don't know how to approach<br/>it yet.")
('Van', 'I might have an idea. Well, if you two are up for it...')
('Van', "Well, I've said what I think needs to be said. The rest<br/>is up to her. Back to patrollin' I go.")
('Paulette', 'Oh, hi, Van. We just wrapped up the breakfast menu<br/>for the day.')
('Victor', "What she said. No more from the morning menu<br/>for you. Don't care if you didn't get enough to eat.<br/>You lost your chance.")
('Van', "I'm fine! I'm a grown-ass adult! I don't need to eat<br/>that much.")
('Van', 'I just dropped by to kill time until I leave for work.')
('Paulette', "Also... I just wanted to say, I'm so glad you all made it<br/>back here safe and sound.")
('Victor', "I second that. Sometimes you make for noisy<br/>neighbors, but lately it's hard to rest easy when things<br/>get too quiet.")
('Victor', "...Especially now that I won't be seeing my Creil<br/>regular anymore.")
('Van', "Oh, yeah. I guess you and that guy from Creil had<br/>some history, huh? I'm sorry.")
('Paulette', 'Yeah. Since he helped with restaurant stock, we got<br/>to know him pretty well.')
('Victor', "We'll be going to his memorial service, as you<br/>can imagine. It's only fair we send him off after<br/>everything he did for us.")
('Van', 'Right. Makes sense...')
('Van', "Well, I'm not going anywhere anytime soon, so<br/>things should still be lively around the office.")
('Van', "But the source of the issue's gone now, so my<br/>assistants might split off soon.")
('Victor', "I'll believe it when I see it.")
('Paulette', "It's a little hard to imagine they would.")
('Van', 'Oh. I was gonna ask earlier, but what about<br/>that racer? Did he stop by again?')
('Paulette', 'He has. He actually stopped by yesterday. Thanks<br/>for asking.')
('Victor', 'Hmph.')
('Van', "That's good, I guess. He all right?")
('Paulette', 'Heehee, I suppose. He enjoyed his meal, at least.')
('Van', "(What's the verdict? Anything between them<br/>or what?)")
('Van', "(What?! You don't gotta glare at me like that!)")
('Yumé', "Oh, are you talking about Maxim? He's funny, in a<br/>lame way. Heehee! ♪")
('Van', "(Dude's got his work cut out for him before anyone<br/>respects him as a father. Good luck, pal.)")
('Gigi', 'Mmm, this is yummy!')
('Latifa', "It's just as good as you said it was. It's lovely to get to<br/>sit down and enjoy this time as family.")
('Inspector Daswani', "Well, I'm glad you both like it.")
('Inspector Daswani', 'When I came here the other day, I heard that they<br/>even serve some dishes with more Central<br/>Eastern flavors.')
('Van', "Out for a meal with your family, Inspector? Good to<br/>see you're enjoying yourself for once.")
('Inspector Daswani', 'Hmph. Look at you, patrolling for the festival.')
('Inspector Daswani', "*sigh* Listen, I'm off duty, so I'll cut you some slack.<br/>Some. Just make sure you know your place and don't<br/>cross any—")
('Gigi', "Daddy! You just said you're off duty, right?<br/>Because you're not acting off duty right now!")
('Inspector Daswani', 'O-Of course I am, sweetheart! I got all of my work<br/>done yesterday. You two have my<br/>undivided attention.')
('Latifa', "Heehee, well, I'm glad to hear it.")
('Latifa', "We don't get family time often. I think I see you walk<br/>out the door to handle a new case more than I<br/>actually see you at home.")
('Gigi', 'Right?! Mommy misses you a lot.')
('Inspector Daswani', "I-I... I know. I'm really, really sorry. You know it's<br/>really hard for me to get time off work...")
('Van', "(I guess the guy's got it hard, too.)")
('Agnès', '(I feel a little sorry for him.)')
('Feri', '(Yeah, I kinda feel sorry for him.)')
('Aaron', "(Dude just needs to learn to play hooky a little and<br/>maybe then he'll relax.)")
('Risette', "(Indeed. I can't help but feel a little pity for him.)")
('Quatre', "(I guess he doesn't have it too easy, yeah.<br/>I sympathize with him a little.)")
('Judith', '(Yeah, geez. I feel for him.)')
('Bergard', "(It isn't easy being so committed to one's job.)")
('Victor', 'Pardon the interruption.')
('Victor', "I've brought you all some dessert.")
('Victor', "It's on the house to celebrate the festival. Enjoy!")
('Gigi', 'Oooh! This also looks really yummy!')
('Latifa', "You didn't have to, but thank you.")
('Inspector Daswani', '(They both look so happy right now... I definitely<br/>made the right call bringing them here today.)')
('Van', "(Heh, look at 'em. Got a pair of doting fathers<br/>over here.)")
('Agnès', "(They're off to some good bonding time, it<br/>looks like.)")
('Feri', '(Heehee, birds of a feather!)')
('Aaron', '(These two are pretty similar when you think about<br/>it, huh.)')
('Risette', "(I don't doubt they're both wonderful fathers.)")
('Quatre', '(To say the least. They really do get along.)')
('Judith', "(I hope he doesn't actually become a regular, though.<br/>Don't need him getting on our case even more than<br/>he already does...)")
('Bergard', '(Heh. It looks like this place has found itself a<br/>new regular.)')
('Judith', "Yes, yes, Mom! I get it! I promise I'll be back in time<br/>for New Year's!")
('Judith', "I'll go ahead and talk to Grammy—what?!<br/>You already told her?!")
('Judith', "Why wouldn't I? You already went off, gallivanting<br/>over to Oración without even telling us!")
('Judith', "And not to mention what the tabloids have been<br/>saying about you! Do you have the slightest idea of<br/>how worried we've been over you?")
('Judith', 'Uh... I can explain! Er...')
('Judith', 'Just make sure you get all of your affairs in order and<br/>tidy yourself up before you come here. Understand?')
('Judith', "By the by, if there's a special someone you're just<br/>getting serious with, you can totally bring them over<br/>with you if you want. Your mom won't mind!")
('Judith', "Mom! Give me a break! You're asking the impossible!")
('Van', "(Sounds like an important family call. I won't<br/>butt in.)")
('Van', "(From the sound of it, she's talking to her mom.<br/>As far as I know, she was a theater actress. And the<br/>second Grimcat.)")
('Van', "(Tough nut to crack. Her grandma's probably<br/>worse, though. She was a chanson singer, and the<br/>first Grimcat. Wouldn't wanna mess with her.)")
('Judith', "You realize I have better things to do with my<br/>life, right? Like, I don't know, my career as the<br/>biggest movie act—")
('Judith', "Excuse me? What do you mean, 'Look for someone<br/>at work'?! You're not seriously expecting me to<br/>do that?!")
('Feri', 'Oh. Hey, everyone!')
('Shaheena', 'Hi, guys! Nice to see you!')
('Ashen', 'Nihao! Happy Revolution Festival!')
('Feri', "Shaheena! And Ashen and Fie! It's nice to see all<br/>of you.")
('Van', "Y'all are awfully cheery.")
('Aaron', "Oh, great. Ashen's here, too.")
('Van', "Y'all are awfully cheery. And Shaheena's here, too.")
('Agnès', "Hi, Ashen. I didn't realize you were with Shaheena<br/>and Fie.")
('Van', "Y'all are awfully cheery.")
('Risette', "Hello, Ms. Shaheena. Ms. Claussell. I didn't realize<br/>you both were together.")
('Van', "Not to mention Heiyue's own little princess. Y'all are<br/>awfully cheery.")
('Judith', "Oh. I didn't know Shaheena was with you.")
('Van', "Not to mention Heiyue's own little princess. Y'all are<br/>awfully cheery.")
('Van', "Y'all are awfully cheery. I see you've got Shaheena<br/>and Heiyue's own little princess with you.")
('Van', 'Did you ladies go to the bathhouse together?')
('Fie', "Yup. We'd made plans for it a little while back.")
('Fie', "But right now, I'm on break. Just finished<br/>morning patrol.")
('Fie', "Hey, Feri. Let's chat again once you're done with<br/>stuff on your end.")
('Fie', "I plan on taking another bath later and it'd be a<br/>shame if you weren't there.")
('Shaheena', 'Oooh, count me in! I wanna come, too!')
('Ashen', 'Let me teach you ladies a few of the skincare secrets<br/>that keep my own skin this beautiful. ♪')
('Feri', 'Yeah! That sounds great! See you then!')
('Van', "(Might be a good idea to swap out who's coming with<br/>me when I get the chance.)")
('Feri', 'Oh. If anything comes up, just call me anytime!')
('Feri', 'Be there in five minutes, tops!')
('Agnès', "Ahaha, it's okay, Feri. You don't have to rush<br/>that much.")
('Aaron', 'Calm down with the overexcited puppy vibes there.')
('Risette', "Heehee, you don't need to hurry that much if that<br/>happens, Ms. Al-Fayed. We'll be okay.")
('Quatre', "Haha, I'm sure we'll be okay, even if you have to take<br/>a little more time.")
('Judith', "You're always so full of energy and raring to go.<br/>Not that it's a bad thing.")
('Bergard', 'Ha! No need to hurry. Just take your time and<br/>enjoy yourself.')
('Van', 'Shoot! They called in demons!')
('Shizuna', 'They must be trying to protect it!')
('System', 'Break the Demon Stone?')
('System', 'Break the Demon Stone?')
('System', 'Break the Demon Stone?')
('System', 'Unfortunately, time passed without them so much as<br/>finding a clue, let alone the book itself.')
('Agnès', "*sigh* I guess it's not going to turn up after all.")
('Agnès', "I'm sorry, Van. I feel like I just wasted your time.")
('Van', "Don't sweat it. I suggested doin' all of this in the<br/>first place.")
('Van', 'We already looked in all the obvious spots.')
('Van', 'Might need to reconsider how we go about it.')
('Agnès', 'Do you think someone stole it?')
('Agnès', "I've been trying to keep my mind off of<br/>that possibility...")
('Van', "It might look a little beat up, but we are talkin' about<br/>a rare first edition here.")
('Van', 'Maybe someone recognized it and just decided to<br/>snatch it.')
('Van', "Could just be like that stolen wallet we were trackin'<br/>down before.")
('Agnès', "If that's the case, maybe we should talk to Mr. Yimai<br/>about it.")
('Agnès', "I don't think contacting the police about it will help if<br/>it's been sold already...")
('Agnès', "True. There might not be much of a point reporting<br/>it to the police, if that's the case...")
('Van', "Don't go throwin' in the towel yet. I got one more<br/>idea, so let's have a crack at it.")
('Van', "Hey. It's Van. Long time no talk.")
('Van', "My assistant and I are tracking somethin' down, and<br/>you might just be the right person to ask.")
('System', 'After Van returned, the boy barged into his office,<br/>demanding that Van hear him out.')
('System', 'Left with little choice, Van resigned himself to<br/>hearing the details of his request.')
(40301, "Come on, man! You're a spriggan, you HAVE to<br/>help us!")
('Van', "Keep beggin' all you want. I don't want anything to<br/>do with whatever shit you're up to.")
('Van', "Way I see it, you're lookin' for someone to cover for<br/>your sorry asses just 'cause you can't man up and take<br/>the loss.")
(40301, "Please listen to me! It's both our gang and our<br/>Riverside turf that's at stake here!")
(40301, "We can't lose to these guys! They're full of shit!")
('Van', "'Your' turf, eh? News to me.")
('Van', "(I'm familiar with these guys. Just a bunch of<br/>smalltime gangs that stick to doing their own stuff in<br/>small pockets around the city.)")
('Van', "(They're too scared of the guild and cops to try to<br/>make any real noise, let alone catch the attention of<br/>actual gangsters.)")
(40301, "Man, you're killing me here! I remember when one of<br/>our guys picked a fight with them and you kicked his<br/>ass like it was no big deal.")
(40301, "I've looked up to you since that! If we had you, we'd<br/>be ten times stronger! Or maybe even a hundred<br/>times stronger!")
('Van', "Dunno what you're talkin' about. Go bother literally<br/>anyone else.")
(40301, "You really just gonna leave us out to dry? We're in<br/>deep shit here!")
(40301, "That crew from Tyrell, they got some outsider to help<br/>them all of a sudden! It's crazy!")
('Van', "An outsider? What kinda guy we talkin' about?")
(40301, "It's some crazy strong red-haired dude.<br/>Already kicked more asses than I can count!")
(40301, 'We were on equal footing until he showed up,<br/>but now... Damn it!')
('Van', '...')
(40301, "Please just think about it? You're the only one who<br/>can help us, bro!")
('Van', "Let's start with that. Don't call me your 'bro.' Ever.")
('Van', '...But I guess I can at least take a look for myself.<br/>Got some time to kill, anyway.')
(40301, "For real?! Hell yeah! Thanks, man! This war's as good<br/>as won!")
('Van', "(I only said I'd look, kid. Ain't making any<br/>promises here.)")
('System', 'Van went back to the office, bringing Yumé upstairs<br/>with him.')
('Van', "Come on, Yumes. Cheer up already. Don't gotta be<br/>so mad.")
('Yumé', "I'm not mad...")
('Yumé', 'I was just...really looking forward to it...')
('System', 'The night before the previous work trip...')
('Yumé', 'Van, are you going on another work trip?')
('Van', 'Yep. Got some stuff in a city called Basel.')
('Yumé', 'Okay. You better behave for Agnès and Feri,<br/>all right?')
('Van', "I will. And you be a good girl while I'm gone, 'kay?<br/>If you behave, I'll bring you back some snacks.")
('Yumé', "Yaaay! You promise me? If you do, I promise I'll be a<br/>good girl!")
('Van', "Yup. It's a promise, Yumes.")
('Van', '(It completely slipped my mind with everything that<br/>happened back in Basel. I feel awful...)')
('Yumé', "Heehee, it's okay. You must've been really busy.")
('Yumé', "I don't mind. And I can always ask Grandpa<br/>for snacks...")
('Van', "(Nope. She totally minds. If she goes back lookin' like<br/>that, Victor's gonna skin me alive.)")
('Aaron', "Heh, looks like you're getting sent to the dog house.")
('Yumé', 'Aaron? Why are you here?')
('Van', "It's rude to listen in on people, you know.")
('Aaron', 'Yeah, yeah. You just need some snacks that are a little<br/>different, right?')
('Aaron', "Hold on a sec. I've got just the thing.")
('System', 'Aaron left and came back soon after carrying<br/>some ingredients.')
('Yumé', 'Wow, Aaron! You can cook?')
('Aaron', "You gotta learn when you live alone for so long.<br/>I don't think I'm as good as your grandpa, but I'm not<br/>too shabby either.")
('Van', "What'cha gonna make?")
('Aaron', "Oh, you'll see.")
('Yumé', 'Oooh! That looks yummy!')
('Van', 'These are mantou, right?')
('Aaron', 'Kinda. Similar, but not the same. Here you go, kiddo.<br/>Have a bite.')
('Yumé', 'Thanks!')
('Yumé', "Mmm! It's so sweet! I love it!")
('Van', '...?!')
('Aaron', "What's the matter? Sweet tooth aching for a bite?")
('Van', "I mean, yeah, I'm a little interested. Not like I'm<br/>dying to have one or anything, though.")
('Van', "Call it academic curiosity. Since I'm a professional<br/>sweets connoisseur and everything.")
('Aaron', 'All right, just shut up and try one. Your excuses<br/>are embarrassing.')
('Van', "Don't mind if I do.")
('Van', 'What the—?!')
('Van', 'Such subtle sweetness inside this round package.<br/>And the buttery-smooth texture from the filling<br/>reminds me of red bean paste. And is that...egg?!')
('Van', "It's sweetest at its center, yet it also has the slightest<br/>hint of sourness to balance it out, too!")
('Van', "So many flavors all compacted together. It's sublime.<br/>Eatin' this warms my very soul!")
('Aaron', 'I knew letting you have one was a bad idea.')
('Yumé', "It's so sweet! And smooth! And YUMMY!")
('Aaron', "...The dough's kneaded with honey. And the eggs got<br/>their seasoning before getting mixed in.")
('Aaron', "The filling's hawthorn mixed with crystal sugar.")
('Aaron', "Gives it some nice variety, both in texture<br/>and sweetness. That's also what gives it the<br/>nice acidity.")
('Van', 'Damn. Look at you, hiding these secret cooking<br/>talents behind the punk façade!')
('Yumé', "I don't get what you guys are talking about, but you're<br/>amazing, Aaron!")
('Aaron', "Hell yeah, I am. That's all you need to know<br/>about me.")
('Yumé', 'Hey, can I share them with Mommy and Grandpa?<br/>I want them to try, too!')
('Aaron', "Sure. There's plenty to go around. Better eat them<br/>while they're still hot.")
('Yumé', "Yaaay! Okay, I'll be back!")
('System', 'Yumé hoisted the plate of sweets up and took<br/>off, beaming.')
('Van', 'Thanks for that, kid. You saved my hide.')
('Aaron', 'Damn straight, I did. You owe me for that, chief.')
('Van', 'Yeah, yeah. I know.')
('Van', "But you seriously caught me off guard. Didn't think<br/>you'd know your way around a kitchen.")
('Aaron', "Well, I don't make sweet stuff all that often.<br/>Compared to how I was growing up, I like savory<br/>stuff better now.")
('Van', "Where'd you pick this recipe up, then?")
('Aaron', '...My mom used to make these all the time.')
('Aaron', 'She was a theater actress, just like me. They were her<br/>way of celebrating plays going well.')
('Aaron', 'I liked them a lot. When I was a kid, at least.')
('Van', 'Huh. Guess acting runs in the family.')
('Aaron', 'You got it. She was pretty damn popular back in the<br/>day, too.')
('Aaron', "Anybody who knew anything about theater knew<br/>who she was. But if they had the sort of<br/>technology that we do now, man, I'm telling you...")
('Aaron', "She'd easily be up there with that Phoenix Dancer<br/>chick from Arc en Ciel.")
('Van', "You're really proud of your mom, huh?")
('Aaron', "I mean...how can I not be? She raised my punk ass all<br/>by herself, for Aidios' sake.")
('Aaron', "I didn't have a dad growing up. Mom was the only<br/>family I ever had.")
('Aaron', "She's the reason I'm into theater, you know.")
('Aaron', 'But she died before I got any good at it...')
('Van', 'Did she teach you how to make those sweets?')
('Aaron', 'Bingo. She taught me right as I started getting<br/>into theater.')
('Van', "Then I don't think you gotta worry about it.")
('Aaron', 'Worry about what?')
('Van', "You said they were her way of celebratin' her plays<br/>being a success, right?")
('Van', "Then she obviously taught you because she was<br/>already sure you'd succeed as an actor.")
('Van', 'And you know what?')
('Van', "I'd bet you anything she could already see you<br/>performin' on stage, absolutely killing it.<br/>Probably knew from the start that you'd make it.")
('Van', "It's what I think, anyway.")
('Aaron', '...Damn it. Where the hell did that come from?')
('Yumé', "Aaron, Aaron! I've got a package for you!")
('Aaron', 'For me? What gives?')
('Yumé', 'I dunno! This lady on an orbal bike told me to give it<br/>to you. She said it was from Langport.')
('Aaron', 'She did?')
('Van', "Hey, that's...")
('Yumé', "Didn't you just make these? That's weird!")
('Aaron', "There's a few letters, too...")
('System', "I figured you're probably getting lonely up in Edith<br/>right about now, so I tried to make these the way your<br/>mom's used to taste.")
('System', 'Make us proud up there. Yours Truly, Ashen<br/>PS: Try not to be a pain in the butt to Van and<br/>everyone else there, okay?')
('System', "Hey, buddy. Ashen had me taste test these to make<br/>sure they'd be up to snuff for you.")
('System', "Keep your chin up and don't stop for nothing!<br/>It's what Sei and Huang would want. —Syd")
('Aaron', 'Damn it, Ashen. Mind your own business.')
('Aaron', "And what the hell's Syd doing here, acting like he's<br/>doing me a favor just for playing taste tester?")
('Aaron', '*sigh* Those guys, I swear...')
('Van', "I think what they're tryin' to say is that you still got a<br/>family, even if you don't have any blood relatives left.")
('Van', 'They still really care about you.')
('Aaron', '...Yeah.')
('Yumé', "Aww. Are you lonely, Aaron? Do you wanna play<br/>with me? I promise you'll feel all better if you do!")
('Aaron', 'Sure, sport. Sounds like fun.')
('Aaron', "What do I do with these, though? They're just gonna<br/>end up getting wasted.")
('Yumé', 'Ask Agnès and everyone else to come! Then we can<br/>eat them together!')
('Aaron', "Sounds perfect. We'll make a whole party of it!")
('Van', "Don't get too carried away, kid. Don't want the<br/>neighbors getting mad.")
('System', 'Aaron did just as Yumé suggested and had the rest of<br/>the agency over for a tasty sweets party.')
('System', 'Once the impromptu party wrapped up, Van resumed<br/>his normal activities.')
('System', "Van's group decided to take a short break.")
('System', 'Everyone split up so they could spend their free time<br/>as they pleased.')
('Van', 'Hey. You said you wanted to talk about some<br/>office paperwork?')
('Risette', 'Correct. In the course of organizing everything, I<br/>found some forms whose deadlines are<br/>quickly approaching.')
('Risette', "I thought you should be made aware of them so that<br/>they aren't submitted late.")
('Van', "Ah, shit. Yeah, don't wanna fall behind on those.<br/>Which forms are they?")
('Risette', 'Actually, I went ahead and sorted them out for<br/>you already. All you have to do is fill them in.')
('Van', "Perfect. Thanks, Risette. Gonna take care of those<br/>right now so they're not hanging over our head.")
('System', 'Van contacted Risette and returned to the office.')
('Risette', 'Thank you for coming in, Mr. Arkride.')
('Risette', 'I hate to impose like this, especially so late, but I<br/>sincerely appreciate it.')
('Van', "Don't mention it. You said you were testing some<br/>features in development for the simulator, right?")
('Van', "Are you sure I'm the man you want for that?<br/>Sounds like it'd go way over my head.")
('Risette', "Certainly. As a matter of fact, there's something that<br/>only you can help me with.")
('Risette', 'Could you please take your Xipha out for me?')
('Van', 'My Xipha? What do you want with that?')
('Risette', 'The holo core system gathers a wide variety of data<br/>through the Xipha, not just biological information.')
('Risette', "This time, I'd like to test location information-based<br/>shard replication functionality to...")
('Risette', "Heehee, perhaps it'd be faster if I just show you.<br/>Are you ready to begin?")
('Van', "I didn't really get all that, but sure. You just need me<br/>to connect my Xipha, right?")
('Van', "...We're back.")
('Risette', 'Strictly speaking, we never left this room in the<br/>first place.')
('Risette', 'How do you feel about this new functionality test?')
('Van', "Good reminder of how crazy shard tech really is,<br/>that's for sure.")
('Van', "Honestly, I'm even more excited to see this fully<br/>realized than I am the combat simulation portion.")
('Risette', 'I agree with you.')
('Risette', 'Thankfully, we managed to record some<br/>excellent data. Things will hopefully continue to<br/>progress smoothly.')
('Van', "But I gotta say, you looked pretty happy while we<br/>were doin' that test.")
('Risette', "As embarrassed as I'd be to admit it, I can't<br/>claim otherwise.")
('Risette', "All I had until now were pictures and videos from<br/>other places. For a while, I thought they'd be all I'd<br/>have, and I was content just imagining them.")
('Risette', 'But thanks to you, Mr. Arkride, I now get to<br/>experience such places for myself.')
('Risette', "If I hadn't taken so long to join you, I might've even<br/>been able to see the places we just simulated.<br/>Honestly, I'm a little jealous of the others.")
('Van', "...You've been through a hell of a lot in your life,<br/>haven't you?")
('Van', "Don't mean to pry, but it's the impression I got after<br/>what happened last trip.")
('Risette', 'That...would be a fair assessment, yes.')
('Risette', 'Regardless of that, I owe a great debt of gratitude<br/>toward the Marduk Company, and Mr. Thorndyke<br/>by extension.')
('Risette', "I wouldn't be here, helping as your concierge, if it<br/>weren't for them. I'm incredibly grateful for<br/>the opportunity.")
('Risette', 'That, in and of itself, is a great privilege and more<br/>than enough for me to feel fulfilled and satisfied.')
('Van', "Don't gotta be so humble. We're happy to have you<br/>here, too, you know.")
('Van', "And don't forget we've got our trip to Longlai comin'<br/>up, too.")
('Van', "I know it's all kinda last minute and not exactly meant<br/>for us, so we might not really have all that much time<br/>to relax.")
('Van', "But I still hope you get to enjoy yourself while<br/>we're there. You deserve it just as much as<br/>anyone else.")
('Risette', 'Thank you, Mr. Arkride. Just the opportunity to join<br/>you all is exhilarating.')
('Risette', "Whether it's the local cuisine, the beautiful vistas, or<br/>the relaxing hot springs, I'm looking forward to it all.")
('System', 'With the simulator test concluded, Van left the room.')
('System', 'After that, he resumed his nighttime patrol.')
('System', "Van's group decided to take a short break.")
('System', 'Everyone split up so they could spend their free time<br/>as they pleased.')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "And...that's it! There! Your hands should be working<br/>a little bit more smoothly nooow.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'Tell me if anything feels off. Or are you doing<br/>just peachy?')
('Risette', "More than 'just peachy.' I actually feel like I'll be able<br/>to perform even more precisely now, thanks to<br/>these adjustments.")
('Van', "Damn, I'm impressed. Can't even tell they're implants<br/>by just lookin' at 'em.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'Heehee. I know, riiight?')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "The updated frame was designed by Marduk's<br/>engineering and development department.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "But I took the receptors that handle her brain's<br/>electrical signals and tried to subdivide them to<br/>further refine their design.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "I also increased the precision of her skin's<br/>cutaneous sensors.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "Hopefully, it'll feel so natural, you won't even know<br/>it's not the real thing. It'll fit juuust like a glove!")
('Van', "Er, all the jargon's going straight over my head, doc.<br/>But hopefully it means it's an improvement?")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "That's right! Though this also puts more of a burden<br/>on the remaining organic parts, albeit faint.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "Since it's only a partial replacement, I'm a teensy bit<br/>concerned about the balance shift between the old<br/>and new parts.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "So be a sweetie and try testing everything with Van?<br/>Just to make sure all's dandy.")
('Risette', 'Of course. I expected as much, having had<br/>adjustments of a similar ilk in the past.')
('Van', "Should probably keep the testin' to day-to-day<br/>activities and see if she can still perform 'em<br/>well, yeah?")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'Yup! That kind of real world use case data is much<br/>more useful than anything a formal test<br/>would generate.')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'What do you say, Van? Wanna help?<br/>Pretty pleaseeee?')
('Van', "Yeah, no prob. I'm her boss, you know. It's in my best<br/>interest to help out with these things.")
('Van', 'Well, what do you say we get started already?')
('Risette', 'Heehee, I appreciate the support, Mr. Arkride.<br/>Thank you for offering your assistance.')
('System', 'From there, Van and Risette got straight to work<br/>testing out her prosthetic parts.')
('Risette', 'Hmm... Typing feels normal.')
('Risette', "Well, that might be inaccurate. The sensation's<br/>definitely changed. The key presses feel much<br/>more vivid.")
('Van', "Huh. I've never even given how typing feels a second<br/>thought, but I guess it's pretty important, too.")
('Van', "I didn't know you were keeping business records for<br/>Master, too.")
('Van', 'Not that I mind, of course. I always intended to pay<br/>him his due, unlike a certain celebrity in our ranks.')
('Risette', "Careful. I can't imagine Ms. Lanster will like<br/>hearing that.")
('Van', "You could fool anyone, standin' in the kitchen<br/>like that. Could pass for a real maid.")
('Risette', "I appreciate the flattery, but I can't quite claim to be<br/>as apt as proper maids in terms of housework.<br/>It's only appearances where I fit the part.")
('Risette', 'However, I feel like I might be able to approximate<br/>my former cooking skills much more closely now.')
('Van', "That's good, Risette. I'm glad to hear it.")
('Risette', "Since I'm already here, would you like me to prepare<br/>you some snacks for later tonight?")
('Van', "Oh, please and thanks. I'm usually hunting for a bite<br/>at night.")
('Van', "Not like I can ever find anything, considering Aaron<br/>loves raidin' the fridge in the middle of the night, the<br/>little mooch.")
('Risette', "Heehee, all right. I'll prepare something light for you.<br/>Don't want to overburden your digestive system<br/>so late.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'And done! No marks on sight for you.')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "I took a look-see at the data you two got for me and<br/>everything looks hunky dory. Your body's not<br/>straining to accommodate for the new parts.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'So feel free to keep using them.')
('Risette', "Are you sure? I was certain that you'd be taking them<br/>back once we were done testing.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "That was the plan, buuut I changed my mind.<br/>Let's call it a gift to celebrate the Revolution Festival.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'And your data indicates that the parts are now<br/>reliable enough to put to practical use.')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'Our data quality has improved so much ever since you<br/>came here. My research has been progressing by leaps<br/>and bounds!')
('Risette', "Oh, that's great news to hear. Thank you for your<br/>generosity, Associate Professor.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "Well, my business here is done! I'm going to<br/>skedaddle now.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "I'm so eager to get my hands on that new data so I<br/>can look it over in more detail.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'Thanks for helping out today, Van!')
('Van', "Don't mention it. You're the one putting in all the<br/>hard work.")
('Van', "All right. Let's take a small break and then it's back<br/>to patrolling. Sound good?")
('Risette', "Of course. Thank you again for assisting with today's<br/>test—oh.")
('Risette', "Actually, there's one last thing we didn't test.<br/>It almost slipped my mind.")
('Risette', "It's not strictly required, so don't feel pressured to<br/>help with it.")
('Van', "That's fine. Don't mind goin' for another round.<br/>Better safe than sorry, right?")
('Risette', 'I suppose so.')
('Risette', 'In that case, Mr. Arkride, could you please hold out<br/>your palm for me?')
('Van', "Uh, I don't get it. What kinda test are we doin' here?")
('Risette', 'Checking skin to skin contact, in a sense.')
('Risette', "I'm checking for two different factors. First, skin<br/>sensitivity and grip to ensure no problems are present<br/>in either. As for the other one...")
('Risette', 'We gauge how someone else feels when I touch<br/>them, and if anything feels wrong on their end.')
('Van', "Got'cha. Well, for my mira, everything's normal.")
('Van', "I probably wouldn't be able to tell you've got<br/>prosthetics on if I didn't know already.")
('Risette', "It's reassuring, hearing that from you.")
('Risette', "As for me... Hmm... The sensation's more lifelike<br/>than it was before. Definitely sharper.")
('Risette', "Your hand's warm, Mr. Arkride. It feels just right.")
('Van', 'I... This is getting a little awkward. No offense.')
('Risette', 'None taken. We can stop here. I sincerely appreciate<br/>your help.')
('Van', "Maybe I just don't know what to look for, but your<br/>body doesn't feel any different to me than<br/>anyone else's.")
('Risette', 'Oh, there most certainly is a difference.')
('Risette', "For all the technological progress being made, it's by<br/>no means easy to genuinely replicate how a human<br/>body feels.")
('Risette', 'Ms. Archette tells me that I can feel approximately<br/>seventy percent of what an organic body is capable of.')
('Risette', "These new parts have perhaps raised the margin by<br/>about 0.67 percent, but there's still much work to<br/>be done.")
('Van', "Huh. I had no idea. Guess we'll just have to pin our<br/>hopes on her and Marduk closing the rest of the<br/>gap eventually.")
('Risette', 'More or less, yes. Though, to be frank, what Olympia<br/>said earlier still lingers in my mind.')
('Risette', 'She described my body as artificial, incapable of<br/>feeling anything genuinely.')
('Risette', 'And that it might be the reason I endlessly aspire for<br/>the real thing, forever unable to attain it.')
('Risette', "Although 'aspire' is perhaps a rather...noble way to<br/>describe it. More than I might deserve.")
('Van', "Hmm... I understand why havin' somethin' feeling<br/>real would be such a big deal for you.")
('Van', "But she's trying to compare you to that doll of hers,<br/>and that's where she's wrong. What your body feels is<br/>just as real as what anybody else feels.")
('Risette', 'How do you mean...?')
('Van', "Let's see... You know how if you try to tickle<br/>someone, some people are fine with it, but others<br/>can't stand it?")
('Van', "And both of those responses are fine, yeah? Can't say<br/>either of them is right or wrong for feeling what<br/>they feel.")
('Van', "And it's not 'cause their bodies are fake or whatever.<br/>It's just each of them havin' a different perception of<br/>the same thing.")
('Risette', '...')
('Van', "Eh... Yeah, okay. Bad example. There's a reason I'm a<br/>spriggan and not a writer. I'm no good at this shit.")
('Van', "Point is, 'real' is what you make of it. If what you<br/>sense feels genuine to you, then it's real.<br/>Prosthetics or not.")
('Van', 'You catch my drift?')
('Risette', 'That I do. Loud and clear.')
('Risette', "You're right. Perhaps I was too fixated on the<br/>difference between a 'real' body and mine. But my<br/>feelings are my own, and I shouldn't doubt them.")
('Risette', 'If I might offer a few words, moments such as this<br/>remind me of something else that feels just as real<br/>to me.')
('Risette', "And it's the place that you occupy in my life, Van, as<br/>well as those of everyone else. It's genuine to me.")
('Risette', "To me, you're not just 'Mr. Arkride,' our boss.<br/>You're precious to me—to us. I'll forever be grateful<br/>to have you in my life. Never forget that.")
('Van', "...Heh, I don't even know what to say to that.<br/>You've changed—for the better. It's nice seein' you<br/>talk like that.")
('Van', "But thanks. I promise I'll always keep that in mind.")
('System', 'After that, Van and Risette continued to relax at the<br/>office for a short while longer.')
('System', 'Shortly after, they decided to return to patrolling<br/>the city.')
('Van', "Hey. You're working late.")
('Quatre', 'Oh. Hi, Van. Care for some stargazing tonight?')
('Van', "Sure, why not? I heard you were up here, so I thought<br/>I'd come and watch with you.")
('Van', "Especially 'cause I didn't get the chance back in Basel,<br/>since we were so busy.")
('Quatre', "You could've just said something. No offense, but<br/>adults have such a strange habit of keeping those<br/>things to themselves sometimes.")
('Quatre', 'Anyway, your timing is perfect. I just finished setting<br/>up the telescope.')
('Van', "That's the one you keep in your room, right?<br/>Looks pretty old. Had it for a while?")
('Quatre', "Yeah. I used it all the time when I was at the<br/>professor's house.")
('Quatre', "It doesn't hold a candle to the one in the observatory<br/>in terms of how much you can see, of course.")
('Quatre', "But it's good enough for some casual stargazing,<br/>which is why I still have it.")
('Quatre', 'Want to check it out?')
('Van', "Sure. You'll have to teach me how to use it, though.<br/>Never used one of these guys.")
('Quatre', "That's fine. I'll demonstrate for you. Stand right next<br/>to me.")
('Quatre', 'Just have to bring it into focus and...there.')
('Quatre', 'I lined it up with the first star in the Great<br/>Schedar Triangle. Have a look.')
('Van', "Awesome. Let's check out that bad boy.")
('Quatre', '(Oh. His face is...really close.)')
('Van', "Man, that's neat. You can barely see it with the<br/>naked eye.")
('Van', 'Still looks a little blurry to me, though. Should I try<br/>twisting the dial like you did?')
('Van', '...Uh, Quatre?')
('Quatre', "Th-That's okay! You just keep looking! I'll turn the<br/>dial for you!")
('Quatre', 'How is it now? Can you see it any better?')
('Van', "Oooh, now we're in business. You can see so much<br/>more detail like this.")
('Van', "All I could see before was it just twinklin' away in<br/>the sky.")
('Van', "You didn't make it sound like this telescope was<br/>anything special, but I can even see the star wobblin',<br/>kinda like a desert's heat haze.")
('Quatre', 'You typically only observe that in constellation<br/>stars specifically.')
('Quatre', "Stars that don't form part of a constellation don't<br/>have that. Their shimmer is less pronounced, and<br/>they move more irregularly. And also...")
('System', 'Van continued admiring different stars as he and<br/>Quatre talked about telescopes and other subjects<br/>in astronomy.')
('Van', "I'll admit, I hadn't ever really given much thought to<br/>this sort of thing until now.")
('Van', "But stars are pretty cool to look at, aren't they?")
('Quatre', 'Oh, absolutely!')
('Quatre', "If you're interested in learning more about astronomy,<br/>I've got some books I'd be happy to lend you.")
('Quatre', "There's one that Gran wrote a long time ago that I'd<br/>definitely rec—")
('Van', 'Whoa, slow down, sport. How about I get the<br/>recommended reads some other time?')
('Van', "I see the glimmer in those eyes. If we start right now,<br/>we're not gonna be done till we can't even see the<br/>stars anymore.")
('Quatre', 'Hmph. Okay... Next time.')
('Van', "But I can see you're real passionate about stargazing.<br/>When did you start?")
('Quatre', "It's all thanks to Gran. She's the one that introduced<br/>me to engineering and academia in the first place.")
('Quatre', "She taught me that an engineer's priority is the<br/>betterment of lives. And that we uncover the true<br/>ways of the world only through academia.")
('Quatre', "And I've always believed in that. I always believed<br/>that I wanted to devote myself to them<br/>wholeheartedly, just like Gran has.")
('Quatre', 'With any luck, I hoped I could even come to terms<br/>with myself, and truly understand the meaning of my<br/>own existence.')
('Quatre', "But...I haven't felt as strongly recently.<br/>Seeing engineering be used to bring harm to other<br/>people is...disheartening, to say the least.")
('Van', "You mean those nuclear weapons? Or are you<br/>talkin' about the Geneses?")
('Quatre', 'Both. The invention of something as terrible as<br/>nuclear weapons has called those beliefs into question<br/>in the first place.')
('Quatre', "But the Geneses... I can't help it. They bother me.<br/>They're prototype orbments, but they've gone from<br/>tools of observation to tools of destruction.")
('Quatre', 'It makes me wonder... What sort of world was it that<br/>Professor Epstein wanted to learn about?')
('Quatre', 'I got this telescope from Gran a long while ago, but I<br/>never forgot what she told me when she gave it to me.')
('Quatre', "'Astronomy is the foundation of all learning. Use this<br/>as your foundation, and start thinking and reflecting<br/>on such matters for yourself.'")
('Van', "I think I get it. Astronomy's about examining Aidios'<br/>miracles through a scientific lens, the ultimate goal<br/>bein' to learn more about our world.")
('Quatre', 'Van... Can I ask how you felt tonight? Looking up at<br/>the stars through my telescope. What did you<br/>think of?')
('Van', 'Hmm... If I had to put it into words, then...')
('Van', "...the sheer size of what's out there. It's so hard to<br/>wrap your head around, you can't describe it as<br/>anything short of a miracle.")
('Van', "It just puts things to perspective. You can't help but<br/>feel tiny, lookin' up at the night sky. Like small<br/>change in the grand scale of things.")
('Quatre', 'Pfft. Haha, ahahahahaha!')
('Van', "Well, sorry if it was too cliché for you or whatever.<br/>It's just how I felt. ...Okay, you can stop<br/>laughing now.")
('Quatre', "Ahaha, I'm sorry. I'm not making fun of you.<br/>You're just the only person I know who'd word it<br/>quite like that.")
('Quatre', "I've always looked at the world through a researcher's<br/>eyes, all while trying my best to follow in<br/>Gran's footsteps.")
('Quatre', "Sometimes I worry if those ideals are holding me<br/>captive, if I'm missing the forest for the trees. Or the<br/>galaxy for the stars, in this case.")
('Quatre', 'You know much more about the world than I<br/>do, Van. Not just the superficial stuff. I wanted to<br/>know what someone like you saw in those same stars.')
('Quatre', 'Hearing you say that was a relief.')
('Quatre', "What you and I see isn't so dissimilar.")
('Quatre', "And if someone like you sees that, too, then I'm not<br/>as lost as I thought I was.")
('Quatre', "I can still try to follow in Gran's path. I haven't lost<br/>sight of it yet. What you said helped reassure me<br/>of that.")
('Van', "Heh. That's a lot to take away from my dumb ass,<br/>but sure.")
('Van', "Though whether you and I see things the same way<br/>or not, if you love and cherish what YOU see, even<br/>after everything you've studied...")
('Van', "...then that's your world, Quatre. And no one can<br/>take that away from you.")
('Quatre', '...You know, Van?')
('Quatre', "I think you're right. I'm only who I am today thanks<br/>to Gran and everyone else in my life.")
('Quatre', "With everyone's help, we can make sure technology's<br/>used to finally grasp the truths in the world all<br/>around us.")
('Quatre', "That is the world I live in, and want to continue<br/>living in. I wouldn't have it any other way.")
('Van', "Then it sounds to me like you've got nothin' to<br/>worry about. You're exactly right where you<br/>should be.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'Quatre, Van! There you two boys are!')
('Associate Professor Esmeray', "You must be AAAWFULLY close if you're spending<br/>time alone looking at the stars together, heehee.")
('Quatre', "Umm, it's not like that! Really!")
('Van', "Haha. Sorry for hoggin' him all night.")
('Associate Professor Esmeray', 'You definitely did, you little thief, you. What have<br/>you two been talking about, hmm?')
('Quatre', 'N-Nothing much, really. Just small talk. Nothing that<br/>would interest you, Essy.')
('System', 'Esmeray happily joined them and, together, the three<br/>of them kept chatting and looking at the stars, if only<br/>for a while longer.')
('System', "Van's group decided to take a short break.")
('System', 'Everyone split up so they could spend their free time<br/>as they pleased.')
('Judith', "Thanks for letting me borrow this. There's this movie<br/>I've been dying to watch again.")
('Van', "Don't mention it. I don't mind lending it to you while<br/>we don't have anything going on.")
('Van', "Just don't break it or anything. I've got a lot of files<br/>on there I'd rather not lose.")
('Judith', "I can handle electronics just fine. I'm not Feri,<br/>you know.")
('Judith', "And don't worry. I won't tell anyone if I find your<br/>search history by accident.")
('Van', '...On second thought, give it back.')
('Judith', "I'm kidding, Van! Relax.")
('Judith', "Anyway, why don't you stay here and watch the<br/>movie with me?")
('Van', "You don't mind the company?")
('Judith', "Not at all. And it's a really good movie.")
('Judith', "But word of warning: It's kind of an oldie, so it might<br/>be a bit boring for you.")
('Van', "Eh, I think I can trust Calvard's biggest actress' taste<br/>in movies.")
('Van', "All right, move over. Let's see what you've got.")
('Van', 'Huh. I think I recognize this.')
('Judith', 'Oh, you do? We can watch something else if<br/>you want.')
('Van', "...Nah. Today's a good day to watch this one.")
('Judith', "That's good, 'cause I'm really in the mood to see<br/>it today.")
('System', 'The two of them settled in and started watching the<br/>movie together.')
('System', 'Eventually, the last of the credits rolled on screen as<br/>music played quietly in the background.')
('Judith', '...')
('Van', 'Yup. Still a good movie.')
('Van', "This one first came out 20 years ago, yeah? Man, it's<br/>been a while. Motion pictures were still new<br/>back then.")
('Judith', 'Uh-huh. I was barely a toddler when it came out.')
('Judith', 'I watched one of its theatrical reruns with Mom back<br/>in the day, but even that was a while ago.')
('Judith', "Watching it again, I'm pretty confident in it being<br/>one of my all time faves.")
('Van', "Not what I would've pinned for your favorite, but a<br/>masterpiece will always be a masterpiece.")
('Judith', "It's kind of a strange romance story, set in a quiet<br/>little country town.")
('Judith', "The cinematography's definitely dated and you can<br/>tell that they didn't have the biggest budget when it<br/>came to props and costumes.")
('Judith', 'But I still really love its atmosphere.')
('Van', "Yeah, the cast's performances and the director's skill<br/>shine through despite that.")
('Van', 'And they filmed it in Creil.')
('Van', "Even if you've never been there, it's hard not to feel a<br/>certain...yearning for the place.")
('Van', "Is it weird to feel nostalgia for a place where you've<br/>never been before? 'Cause that's how it felt when I<br/>first went there.")
('Judith', 'No, I get what you mean.')
('Judith', 'I filmed there once before. I was so excited when we<br/>finally arrived that I kept flubbing my lines. Had to<br/>do a looot of retakes.')
('Judith', "Heh, our director wasn't happy with that.")
('Judith', 'But when I think about it, this is what drove me to<br/>become an actress in the first place.')
('Judith', 'I always wanted to film something there. Wanted the<br/>chance to make something that, one day, would mean<br/>as much to someone as this movie does to me.')
('Judith', 'So much for that dream, I guess...')
('Van', "I'm sorry...")
('Judith', "It's fine! It just means I'm all the more<br/>determined now!")
('Judith', "Van, we've got to settle the score, whatever it takes.")
('Van', "'We,' eh? Finally decided you're part of the team?<br/>Can't take it back once you say yes.")
('Judith', "Haha, I wouldn't. I'm part of the team now.")
('Judith', "We can't let ourselves lose to that fear nonsense that<br/>dumb mafioso was talking about.")
('Judith', "We'll make it up to everyone that's suffered because<br/>of them. They deserve to feel safe and happy again,<br/>and we'll make sure they do.")
('Judith', "And that's not just Phantom Thief Grimcat talking.<br/>I mean it as Judith Lanster, too. The movie actress.")
('Van', "Okay, okay. You're gettin' a little sappy for my taste.<br/>Tone it down, Miss Intense.")
('Van', "Heh... It's kinda contagious, though. Maybe we need<br/>more of that energy 'round the office.")
('Van', 'Welcome to the team, Judith. Glad to have you here.')
('Judith', 'Damn right you are! It feels good to be here, too!')
('System', 'Their hearts full of newfound determination, Van and<br/>Judith rejoined the team and resumed their patrol.')
('Bergard', 'Heh. Since when do you own that, Van?')
('Van', "I don't. Just borrowin' it from a friend who runs a<br/>repair joint.")
('Van', "I'll say, tonight's too pretty a night to waste it riding<br/>alone, Master.")
('Van', "Mind if I tag along? If your unworthy old student<br/>won't put a damper on your night, that is.")
('Bergard', 'Haha! All right, you can come.')
('Bergard', 'Nothing wrong with a master and his former student<br/>going out on an adventure here and there.')
('Bergard', "I'm going to roll down Highway 12. Try to keep up<br/>with me.")
('Van', 'Haha, you got it. Lead the way.')
('Van', 'And...here we are.')
('Van', 'Okay, you can open your eyes now.')
(40301, '...')
('Van', 'What do you think? Pretty sweet view, huh? You can<br/>even see Trion Tower from here.')
('Van', "We're on the roof of where I live. Area's not the best<br/>tourist spot in town, but I like it just the same.")
('Van', "Pretty roomy and bright, right? If any weirdos come<br/>knocking, you'll see 'em from a selge away.")
('Van', "And if push comes to shove, I'm sure she'll be more<br/>than happy to cut anyone down to size.")
('Van', "You've got nothing to worry about here, I promise.")
('Elaine', "*sigh* I'd appreciate it if you didn't make me look like<br/>a bloodthirsty savage...")
(40302, "It's really nice here.")
('Van', "Agreed. Might be a little old and musty, but other<br/>than that, it ain't too shabby.")
('Van', "All right, now that you've seen this, let's head back<br/>down to the bistro on the ground floor.")
('Van', "They make some pretty mean desserts I'm sure<br/>you'll love. I know I do!")
(40301, '...')
('System', "Van's group decided to take a short break.")
('System', 'Everyone split up so they could spend their free time<br/>as they pleased.')
('Paulette', "Thanks for helping out, Van. You don't know how<br/>much I appreciate it.")
('Van', "Hey, no problem. That's what neighbors are for.")
('Van', "I know you've got a lot to buy and could use a<br/>helping hand. I'm always happy to help.")
('Yumé', 'Can I go with you guys? I wanna come, too!')
('Paulette', "All right, but you have to help us if you're going to<br/>come, okay?")
('Van', "And don't go wandering off.")
('Yumé', "Okay! Yaaay, shopping! We're gonna go shopping! ♪")
('Paulette', "We've got a few places to visit today. First...")
('Brenda', 'I gave you a bit of a loyal customer discount, Paulette.<br/>Thanks for always shopping here.')
('Brenda', "Van, I trust you're not going to make her carry it all<br/>back to the restaurant, right? Be a gentleman.")
('Van', "I am, I am. That's what I'm here for.")
('Paulette', "Oh, you didn't have to do that, Brenda. You already<br/>gave Yumé that candy the last time we came here.")
('Yumé', 'That was so yummy! Thank you so much!')
('Brenda', "You're so polite for your age, Yumé. I'm impressed!")
('Brenda', "And don't you worry about it, Paulette. This is just<br/>my way of showing you thanks for making this<br/>neighborhood a better place to live in.")
('Brenda', "I mean, just think about how long you've been<br/>coming here. Since before you left home, really.")
('Brenda', "Though I guess you've been working at Montmart for<br/>a while now. Hope you haven't gotten bored.")
('Paulette', "Haha, I don't think I could. I grew up with just Dad<br/>around, so it's always been home for me.")
('Paulette', "Him AND his cooking. Wouldn't give that up<br/>for anything.")
('Yumé', "Grandpa! I'm back!")
('Victor', "Hey! There's my little Yumé!")
('Paulette', "Aren't you going to ask? About her and me, I mean.")
('Paulette', "You must realize by now we're not the most ordinary<br/>family, right?")
('Paulette', "I can't imagine you of all people wouldn't<br/>have noticed.")
('Van', 'Hey, what kind of guy do you take me for?')
('Van', "I'm not that insensitive. I know better than to go<br/>sniffing around a woman's private business.")
('Paulette', "Heehee, I didn't mean it like that.")
('Paulette', "We've just known each other for a long time now.<br/>I feel a little bad keeping things from you.")
('Van', "Nah, don't be. There's nothing to feel sorry about.")
('Van', "If you want, you can just think of it as me repayin'<br/>the favor.")
('Van', "You guys didn't grill me for details when I first rented<br/>out the floor above yours. It was no questions asked,<br/>and I really appreciated that.")
('Van', "I'm not gonna go diggin' into someone's personal<br/>affairs if they don't offer the info up first. Call it a<br/>personal policy.")
('Paulette', "Right. I've always known you to be a rather discreet<br/>and considerate man.")
('Paulette', 'Thank you so, so much, Van.')
('Van', "Ehh, I'm just doing what any decent guy should.")
('Van', "But if it makes a pretty woman like you happy, I ain't<br/>gonna complain.")
('Paulette', 'Hmm? I was talking about our errand running<br/>just now.')
('Van', "Were you? Well, I'll take your word for it.")
('Yumé', 'Mommy, Van! What are you doing? Come on!')
('Paulette', "We're coming, sweetie!")
('Paulette', 'If you still have time before you have to return to<br/>work, then let me brew you some coffee. On<br/>the house.')
('Van', 'Never gonna say no to that.')
('System', 'After the brief coffee break, Van reunited with the<br/>others and resumed work.')
('Yumé', "I hope you're ready, Van! I'm not gonna go easy<br/>on you!")
('Van', "Haha, someone's eager to learn.")
('Van', "I'm impressed you want to try it. It's pretty tricky for<br/>a kid your age.")
('Yumé', "That's okay! I've watched Grandpa play before.<br/>It always looks fun!")
('Van', "I figured he might've had somethin' to do with it.<br/>I've seen him playing with his buddies before.")
('Van', 'Why not ask him to teach you instead of me?')
('Van', "I'm sure he'd be really happy to do so.")
('Yumé', "Heehee, don't worry about it!")
('Yumé', 'And I wanna play with you, Van!')
('Van', "*sigh* All right. If that's what you want, we can go<br/>a round.")
('System', 'With that, Van and Yumé started playing.')
('System', 'Just the act of teaching Yumé how to move the pieces<br/>was a struggle in and of itself, let alone all the other<br/>rules and complexities in chess.')
('System', "She'd flick her pieces at his to knock them down one<br/>moment, and the next she'd be trying to use already<br/>captured pieces as her own.")
('System', "But Van's patience never wavered. He gently, and<br/>slowly, continued teaching Yumé the rules behind<br/>chess in an easy to digest way.")
('Van', "Oh, is that how you're gonna play?")
('Yumé', 'Yup! My house, my rules!')
('Van', 'My mistake, Your Highness.')
('Van', "(Well, as long as she's having fun.)")
('System', 'Little by little, Yumé finally began to grasp the rules.')
('System', 'Her tendency to make a move guided just by intuition<br/>made her very unpredictable.')
('Van', 'Your turn, Yumes.')
('Yumé', "Hmm... Who's next?")
('Van', "(Haven't been playing for long, but her instincts are<br/>real sharp already.)")
('Van', "(No hesitation when makin' a play, either. Well, I<br/>guess she's still a kid.)")
('Van', "(She's good at catchin' me off guard.)")
('Yumé', 'I know! How about this?')
('Yumé', 'Heehee, take that! Your turn, Van!')
('Van', "Whoa, that's a really good play there, kiddo.")
('Van', "Keep this up, and you might end up goin' pro when<br/>you're older.")
('Yumé', "Heehee, maybe! I'm just glad you're having fun!")
('Van', 'Huh? Are you not having fun, too?')
('Yumé', "I am! I'm having lots of fun!")
('Yumé', "And it's because you are, Van.")
('Yumé', "You've been so happy lately.")
('Yumé', "You're always smiling now that Agnès and Feri and<br/>Aaron and Risette are here!")
('Van', 'What? Was I not happy before that?')
('Van', "(Heh. You ain't wrong, kid.)")
('Van', "(Not a lot to be happy 'bout back when I'd<br/>just started. Just a bunch of shady jobs. I was just<br/>seeing the worst in people.)")
('Van', "(I thought I knew what I was gettin' into, but spend<br/>too long surrounded by nothing but darkness and you<br/>eventually go blind.)")
('Van', "(I don't think I can thank you enough, kiddo.<br/>That bright smile of yours was like a lifeline for me,<br/>even when everything else in my life was grim.)")
('Van', "(If only you knew how special you are. No wonder<br/>your granddad's so crazy about you.)")
('Yumé', 'Hey! Are you listening to me?')
('Yumé', "It's your turn, Van! Come on!")
('Van', 'Oh, sorry, Yumes. Okay, my next move is...')
('Victor', 'Hey, you punk!')
('Victor', "Don't you think it's about time I had my<br/>granddaughter back? It's getting late!")
('Van', "Crap, I lost track of time. Sorry, kiddo. We'll have to<br/>finish our match another day.")
('Yumé', 'Aww, but I wanna keep playing!')
('Yumé', 'But okay... I had fun!')
('Yumé', 'Look, Grandpa! Look! I learned how to play chess!')
('Yumé', 'Now we can play together!')
('Victor', 'Y-Yumé!')
('Van', "(Ah. That's why she wanted me to teach her.)")
('Victor', 'Ahem! On second thought, I may have been<br/>too strict.')
('Victor', "You can keep playing with our good-for-nothing<br/>neighbor. Just make sure you don't go to bed<br/>too late.")
('Yumé', 'Really?!')
('Victor', 'Yep. You earned it for making your old grandpa<br/>so proud! ❤ Just promise to not keep your mom<br/>waiting or she might get mad.')
('Yumé', 'Yaaay! I promise!')
('Van', "Heh. You are such a sucker for Yumes. Can't imagine<br/>there's much you wouldn't do for her.")
('Victor', 'No one asked you.')
('Yumé', "Let's split into teams! Me and Grandpa against<br/>you, Van!")
('Van', "Two on one? Well, that ain't fair, but I'm in.")
('Van', "If I get to play your granddad, then that means I don't<br/>have to hold back and—")
('Victor', "I don't think so. Only one of us gets to look good in<br/>front of Yumé, and I'm certain you understand who<br/>it'll be.")
('System', 'The three of them kept playing deep into the night<br/>until an exasperated Paulette finally came to check<br/>on them.')
('System', "Van's group decided to take a short break.")
('System', 'Everyone split up so they could spend their free time<br/>as they pleased.')
('Victor', 'Graaaaaah!')
('Van', "Yeesh. Sounds pretty serious. Must be tough<br/>gettin' old.")
('Van', "Careful you don't throw out your back, Victor.<br/>Think about all the piggyback rides you'll be<br/>depriving your granddaughter of.")
('Victor', 'Urgh! Not happening.')
('Yumé', 'Grandpa, are you okay?')
('Van', "I think you'd better take the day off, man.")
('Victor', "Are you nuts? I can't take time off over a few aches<br/>and pains.")
('Victor', 'Not only do I have our regulars and reservations to<br/>handle, but today and tomorrow are inventory<br/>stocking days. Those are crucial.')
('Victor', 'We also need to start making test batches for the<br/>Revolution Festival menu.')
('Yumé', "Grandpa, you can rest! It's okay! Mommy and I can<br/>handle it!")
('Victor', 'Aww, thank you, Yumé. Just hearing those words<br/>makes your grandpa feel stron—aaargh!')
('Van', 'I think that settles it. You need help in the kitchen<br/>today, period.')
('Van', "Tell you what: If you think I'm up to the task, I'll take<br/>over the kitchen for a while.")
('Van', "I can't do it all day, but it's the least I can do.<br/>You've been cookin' a lot for me throughout<br/>the years.")
('Victor', "Hmph. I don't recall you owing me for any of it,<br/>you punk.")
('Victor', "...Very well. But I'm not going to abandon<br/>the kitchen. I don't like it, but you can help out<br/>during rush hour.")
('Victor', "I'm going to supervise your cooking. And don't<br/>expect me to go easy on you just because you're doing<br/>me a favor, either. Understand?")
('Van', 'Fair enough. Your joint, your rules. Just tell me what<br/>to do, boss.')
('Yumé', "Yaaay, thanks, Van! I'll help with the customers!")
('System', 'With that, Van took his post in the Montmart<br/>kitchen and got to cooking.')
('Victor', "You're cutting the cabbage wrong. Slice it<br/>more finely.")
('Van', 'Like this?')
('Victor', 'No, even more.')
('Van', 'Like...this?')
('Victor', "Now that's too fine.")
('Victor', "No, no! Don't stir so fast!")
('Van', "I thought you said you didn't want it to burn.<br/>Which is it?")
('Victor', "Both. Keep stirring so it doesn't burn, but don't do it<br/>too fast.")
('Victor', "Once that's ready, go grab a bag of flour and a can of<br/>milk from the pantry.")
('Yumé', 'Hang in there, Van! You can do it!')
('Victor', "Heh, it's clear as day whose dish looks<br/>more appetizing.")
('Van', "Sheesh, when did this become a competition, huh?<br/>You're the pro, of course yours is better.")
('Van', "But I think my stuff holds its own just fine.<br/>The presentation's not too shabby, at least.")
('Victor', "You think so, huh? Don't get cocky, punk.<br/>You've still got a lot to learn.")
('Van', "We'll see about that. Let's taste 'em and find out.")
(40304, "Haha, good to see your back hasn't put a damper on<br/>your spirit, Victor.")
(40304, "If I didn't know any better, I'd almost think you two<br/>were having some nice father and son bonding time.")
('Van', "I'll have to take your word for it. Don't really know<br/>how that's supposed to look.")
('Victor', "Good thing he isn't my actual son, or I would've<br/>disowned him after all the trouble he's caused<br/>around here.")
('System', 'The rush hour continued apace with Van and Victor<br/>yelling at one another in the kitchen, their hands full<br/>with customer orders.')
('Van', "Aidios, your old man really likes crackin' the whip.")
('Van', "My arms are so sore, I ain't gonna be liftin' anything<br/>heavier than my Xipha today.")
('Paulette', "Heehee. You'll survive, Van. You're too young to be<br/>that worn out.")
('Paulette', "Still, thanks for helping my dad today. It means a lot.<br/>It's not much, but here's a little something on<br/>the house.")
('Van', "Oh, damn. You didn't have to, but thanks, Paulette.")
('Paulette', "My dad's really fired up after all that. He put extra<br/>effort into it, just for you.")
('Victor', "You didn't have to tell him that...")
('Van', "Oh, really now? Well, I appreciate it. This'll hit the<br/>spot after an afternoon of backbreaking work in<br/>that kitchen.")
('Victor', 'Hmph.')
('Victor', 'Even I have to admit when a good-for-nothing son<br/>has earned his keep.')
('Victor', 'I speak from experience when I say this: a family can<br/>take on many forms.')
('Victor', 'Maybe it only has one parent, or maybe no one in it is<br/>even related by blood.')
('Victor', "Point is, there's no 'right' way to be a family. You get<br/>to define what your family is, and which bonds<br/>you cherish.")
('Van', "Couldn't have said it better myself. Careful, though.<br/>I don't think I'm the only potential son in the picture.")
('Victor', "Like hell! Gehenna will freeze over before I'll count<br/>that two-timing scumbag as one of my own!")
('Van', 'I never named any names.')
('Paulette', 'I can only imagine who you two might be<br/>talking about.')
('Yumé', "Heehee, Grandpa's right. You and me are family.")
('Yumé', "I'll ALWAYS be with you, Van! I promise!")
('Van', "*sigh* You sure can melt a grown-up's heart. But you<br/>should be real careful making promises like that at<br/>that age.")
('Van', 'But thank you, Yumes. It means a lot.')
('Victor', "Don't care what you think. If you disappoint my<br/>sweet, innocent granddaughter, you're going to be in<br/>for a world of pain, you brat.")
('Paulette', 'What he really means to say is take care of<br/>yourself, Van. He worries you might be overdoing it<br/>at your job sometimes.')
('Victor', "Paulette! You could've kept that part to yourself!")
('Van', "Haha, I hear you. I'll be careful out there.")
('System', 'After the short break, Van reunited with the others<br/>and resumed work.')
('Director Lam', "There's an actress I've been working with whose work<br/>I'd like your opinion on, if that's okay.")
('Director Lam', "Ever since I offered her the part, she's been immersed<br/>in the role, almost to a scary degree. I was originally<br/>gonna ask Judith for help here...")
('Judith', "But it might be a bad idea if I did it, since I'm not<br/>involved with the film's production at all.")
('Judith', "I know you're pretty tight-lipped, so I said why not?<br/>So, you gonna help?")
('System', "Van's group decided to take a short break.")
('System', 'Everyone split up so they could spend their free time<br/>as they pleased.')
('Van', "(Looks like it's raining out. Bit of a shame for this<br/>time of year.)")
('Van', '(Wonder if the Goddess is crying somewhere out<br/>there, too...)')
('Van', '(Heh, what am I doing, getting all sappy? I should<br/>just get up and grab a bite.)')
('Van', "(I was so busy this morning, I didn't even have time<br/>for breakfast.)")
('Van', "(Don't wanna keep everyone else waitin', though.<br/>Better make it something light and quick.)")
('Hermès', "Here's your delivery.")
('Van', 'Thanks. I appreciate you being so quick.')
('Hermès', "Don't mention it. I get my customers what they need<br/>ASAP, rain or shine.")
('Hermès', "Why order food, though? You could've just gone<br/>downstairs and eaten with everyone else.")
('Hermès', "But anyway... It's just you right now?")
('Van', 'Yeah, I just got back a little bit ago.')
('Hermès', "Got'cha.")
('Hermès', "Could we talk outside once you're done eating?<br/>Only if you feel like it, of course. No pressure.")
('Hermès', "I know it's raining and all, but we can work<br/>around that.")
('Van', "Well, this is a surprise. Wasn't expecting you of all<br/>people to ask me out today.")
('Van', "Come in and have a seat on the couch. I'll get you<br/>a drink. I'll be done with the food real quick.")
('Jess', 'Whoa, this is awesome!')
('Jess', "I can't believe we get to see something like this here<br/>in Old Town!")
('Feri', 'Those two are so amazing!')
('Quatre', "Yeah, they're even better than I expected.")
('Agnès', "Heehee, they've clearly honed their dance routine.")
('Van', "I know they just wanted somewhere to practice before<br/>the big event, but I feel kinda rude not tippin' them<br/>for such a damn good performance.")
('Shaheena', "*sigh* There's nothing like a good bath after dancing.")
('Shaheena', "I like this place! It's different from the hamam we<br/>have back home, but in a good way.")
('Feri', "Right? It's our favorite place around here.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'Oh, and before I forget! I brought you all some shea<br/>butter from Tharbad. I hope you like it.')
('Agnès', "Really? Aww, you didn't have to. Thank you!")
('Risette', "What a lovely gift, Ms. Saara. I'd be honored to<br/>have some.")
('Aaron', "Man, chicks love chatting. They're not getting out of<br/>there anytime soon, huh?")
('Van', "Eh, it's fine. Let 'em catch up. Why don't we grab<br/>some sherbet and kill some time with Quatre, since<br/>he's waiting outside?")
('Feri', "I'm so happy for you guys! I'm so glad your<br/>performance with Arc en Ciel went great!")
('Risette', 'Yes, we received your letter about it right after the<br/>show concluded.')
('Shaheena', "Heehee, I hope you guys didn't mind. We were both<br/>so jazzed up about it, I had to tell someone while it<br/>was all fresh!")
('Shaheena', 'I mean, how often do a couple of street dancers like<br/>us get to be directed by the Fervent Dancer, Ilya<br/>Platiere herself?')
('Shaheena', "Not that we were intimidated by them or anything.<br/>They might be famous, but we kept up with 'em and<br/>their routine just fine!")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "Haha, you never get tired of telling everyone all that,<br/>do you? It's all you've talked about ever since we<br/>got home.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "Honestly, I don't actually remember the<br/>performance much.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'All I remember is the exhilaration once it was all over.<br/>It was kind of like I was in a trance.')
('Aaron', "Yeah, I totally get what you're talking about. When<br/>you get so absorbed in a performance everything<br/>else vanishes. You could call it a dancer's high.")
('Quatre', 'It sounds like it was a really stimulating and fruitful<br/>time, overall.')
('Agnès', "Absolutely. I wish we could watch you two up on<br/>stage, now that you've improved so much.")
('Agnès', "Unfortunately, it doesn't look like our schedules are<br/>going to line up to see your show today. I'm<br/>really sorry.")
('Van', "Speaking of which, how're we doin' on time?")
('Van', "You've still got your rehearsal, don't you? You sure it's<br/>okay for you to just be hangin' around with us?")
('Shaheena', "It's fine! I double checked everything earlier, so we<br/>should still be on time.")
('Shaheena', "I'm the one managing our schedule this time, so we've<br/>got nothing to...")
('Shaheena', 'Oh. Oh, NOOOOOO!')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "Shaheena? What's the matter?")
('Shaheena', 'We, uh, got a problem.')
('Shaheena', 'I totally screwed up our schedule!')
('Shaheena', "We've only got a half hour before the rehearsal starts!")
('Aaron', 'What?!')
('Quatre', "Well, that's not good.")
('Shaheena', "I'm SO sorry, Saara! Please don't be mad...")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "It's okay, Shaheena. Time flies when you're<br/>with friends. I should've been on top of things, too.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'But we should get going. Gotta get to the<br/>venue soon.')
('Van', "All right. Let's go. I'll bring the truck around.")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "You don't have to, Van. It's okay.")
('Quatre', "It'll be faster that way.")
('Quatre', "Knowing the time tables and how long it'll take to get<br/>there on foot, you won't make it in time by taking<br/>the subway.")
('Risette', "That is indeed correct. But if you allow Mr. Arkride<br/>to drive you, you'll arrive with even a few moments to<br/>spare as long as you take the highway.")
('Risette', "You should go. I'll keep him informed on the current<br/>traffic conditions while he's on the road.")
('Van', "What they said. Just go ahead and get your<br/>things together. I'll be back in a flash.")
('Shaheena', 'All right! Thanks a ton, Van!')
('Shaheena', "I'm so sorry we have to take off like this, you guys.")
('Feri', "That's okay! We'll see you two again soon!")
('Agnès', "Van's a great driver. He'll make sure you make it<br/>in time! Good luck, you two!")
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'Thanks, Agnès! We owe you all one!')
('System', "Saara and Shaheena climbed into Van's pickup truck<br/>and made a beeline for the highway.")
('System', 'Unfortunately...')
('Prince Sherid', '*sigh* This is great. These baths have a different feel<br/>to them compared to your average hamam.')
('Van', "They're the best place I know for when you need<br/>a pick-me-up.")
('Van', "Can only imagine what it must be like, talkin' with<br/>the big boss.")
('Prince Sherid', "Indeed. I can't go into detail about what we discussed,<br/>of course, but one might certainly describe our<br/>meeting as...taxing, to say the least.")
('Prince Sherid', 'I will say, for a man so powerful, he was fairly candid.<br/>Somewhat anticlimactic, really.')
('Prince Sherid', "But I suppose that's what it takes to win such broad<br/>support amongst the public after the distrust garnered<br/>following the war and economic crisis.")
('Van', "He's a force to be reckoned with, that's for<br/>damn sure. I know he's up to something with René.")
('Prince Sherid', "Between you and me, I believe my sister would've<br/>done a far better job navigating that conversation<br/>than I did.")
('Van', "I forgot you had a sister. Isn't she a fair bit younger<br/>than you?")
('Prince Sherid', "That's right—though her age belies her intellect.<br/>Her mind is quite sharp, but unfortunately, her<br/>tongue is far sharper.")
('Prince Sherid', "She always feels the need to get a word in edgewise—<br/>under the pretext of supporting me as the heir to<br/>Elsaim's throne.")
('Prince Sherid', "She and my father, the grand prince, both have lofty<br/>expectations for me. I hope that, when the time<br/>comes, I'll be able to meet them.")
('Van', "Sounds pretty rough. You've got a lot ridin' on<br/>your shoulders.")
('Prince Sherid', "You're not wrong. I wish to broaden my horizons, all<br/>so I can make Elsaim a nation capable of standing on<br/>par with Zemuria's great powers.")
('Prince Sherid', "That's why I decided to come to the Republic.<br/>I wanted to study it and take in as much as I could.")
('Prince Sherid', "That was the plan, anyway. Despite that, all I did at<br/>first was indulge, night after night. Not that I didn't<br/>enjoy that, mind you.")
('Prince Sherid', 'But that free time just left me thinking...')
('Prince Sherid', "'What would he say, if he were here? What would he<br/>do, if he was in my shoes?'")
('Van', "'He'? Who're you...? Oh, you mean that wandering<br/>bard, yeah?")
('Van', 'Claussell knows him. She told me a little about him<br/>while we were in Tharbad.')
('Van', "He's quite the guy. I caught wind of a lot of what he<br/>got up to through work two years ago.")
('Prince Sherid', 'The very same. He traveled the continent from a<br/>young age, advocating for harmony between nations.')
('Prince Sherid', "I had the pleasure of meeting him once before.<br/>He'd come to visit Elsaim, and I saw first-hand what<br/>kind of man he really was.")
('Prince Sherid', "Quite the charmer, he is. It wasn't long before I held<br/>him in the highest esteem.")
('Prince Sherid', "And that's what I've been chasing this whole time.<br/>Following his example, growing and bettering myself<br/>for that goal.")
('Prince Sherid', "I fear, however, that I can never measure up to him.<br/>He's special in his own right, and I worry I'll never<br/>reach the pedestal I've put him on.")
('Prince Sherid', "It feels as though I'm following after a mirage in the<br/>desert, so tantalizing, yet forever just out of my reach.")
('Van', "...Huh. No offense, but that kinda caught me off<br/>guard. Didn't realize you had such deep thoughts.")
('Van', "Not like I wanna tell you what to do or anything, but<br/>it looks to me like you gotta start livin' your<br/>own life.")
('Prince Sherid', 'My own life? Elaborate.')
('Van', "At the end of the day, you gotta strive for somethin'<br/>more than just being a copycat. Can't always live in<br/>his shadow.")
('Van', "You're the only one that can choose how to live<br/>your life.")
('Van', "So what if you get a little lost in that desert? It's not<br/>all sand. An oasis will pop up here and there, for you<br/>to rest when you're weary.")
('Van', "And you know how I'm so sure? 'Cause there are<br/>suckers like me who choose to be a spriggan.<br/>Now that's a dark and uncertain path.")
('Van', "But what I'm tryin' to get at is that there's not just<br/>one way to live a life, or achieve a goal. Everyone has<br/>their own compass.")
('Prince Sherid', '...')
('Van', "But what do I know, really. I'm just an outcast, so<br/>maybe don't put so much stock in what I say.")
('Prince Sherid', "On the contrary, my friend. What you've said has<br/>done a lot to put my mind and heart at ease.")
('Prince Sherid', "I never thought I'd be taking life lessons from the<br/>likes of you. It seems you've perhaps lived a richer life<br/>than I first thought.")
('Van', "'Richer' is one way of puttin' it. Dunno if I<br/>agree, though. I'm just a handyman who's been in the<br/>business for a while now.")
('Naje', "Did you have a nice bath, Your Highness? I've come<br/>to pick you up.")
('Prince Sherid', "Well, you finally found me, Naje. Or, knowing you,<br/>you probably didn't even lose me in the first place.")
('Van', "I'm leanin' towards the latter. I definitely found it<br/>strange you somehow managed to shake off<br/>Zemuria's most fearsome bodyguard.")
('Naje', "I'll take that as a compliment. Had it been anyone<br/>else but you, I wouldn't have allowed him to<br/>remain alone.")
('Naje', 'So long as His Highness had a fruitful night out, I<br/>suppose it was worth the trouble.')
('Prince Sherid', 'Haha. There you go, always a step ahead of me.')
('Prince Sherid', 'Thank you, Van. I learned a lot during our<br/>rendezvous this evening.')
('Prince Sherid', "I feel as though I've peered a little more into those<br/>unknowable depths of yours.")
('Prince Sherid', "I pray you find great success with your assignment in<br/>Basel, not only as a client who's retained<br/>your services...")
('Prince Sherid', '...but as a friend who has bared much to you now,<br/>literally and figuratively.')
('Van', "Thanks, Your Highness. I promise we'll do what we<br/>can to deliver you results.")
('Van', "This hasn't been such a bad night after all.")
('Van', "Oh, damn. I just remembered Paulette's old man<br/>wanted to see me.")
('Victor', 'There you are, you buffoon.')
('Van', "Yep, that's me. What's up? Somethin' urgent?")
('Victor', "Hold on a sec. You'll find out soon enough.")
('Victor', 'Here we go. Take a look at this.')
('Agnès', "Oh, that's...")
('Feri', "Wow! They're like the galettes we had back in Creil!")
('Victor', "From your reactions, I take it mine's a good match for<br/>the real thing. Good, good.")
('Van', 'More than good. It looks perfect to me. You did great<br/>as always, Victor.')
('Victor', "Looks perfect? It TASTES perfect, punk! Try one for<br/>yourself and you'll see.")
('System', 'Received a large helping of <br/>.')
('Agnès', 'Thank you so much for that! That was wonderful!<br/>How did you manage to figure out the recipe?')
('Victor', 'You kids told me about the food you had in that<br/>village, remember?')
('Victor', 'Well, I gleaned some more insight from an expert<br/>and decided to take a stab at recreating it, myself.')
('Feri', 'An expert? Who was it?')
('Victor', "My vegetable supplier from Creil. He's in the back<br/>right now, but he'll be out on the main floor later.")
('Van', "I'm surprised you of all people wanted to recreate a<br/>recipe rather than come up with your own.<br/>That doesn't happen very often.")
('Victor', 'Well, after hearing your story, Yumé said she wanted<br/>to try it and...you know...')
('Van', "Granddad can't say no to his precious<br/>little granddaughter. Of course.")
('Victor', "I'll admit, it's been refreshing trying my hand at<br/>making something different.")
('Victor', "That's where you all come in. If you find more<br/>interesting dishes, I want to know. I won't put them<br/>on the menu, but I'll make them for free.")
('Agnès', "Really? Are you sure? I feel like we'd be imposing if<br/>we didn't give you anything in return.")
('Victor', "It's fine. It'll help me flex my cooking muscles.<br/>Just get me the necessary ingredients and we'll call<br/>it even.")
('Van', "Sounds fair to me, especially since we'll get to take<br/>the dishes.")
('Van', "We'll be sure to tell you about any good eats we find<br/>along the way, and you can work your magic.")
('Victor', 'Perfect. Looking forward to hearing what you<br/>kids find.')
('Van', "Well, we'd better get moving now. Gang, let's roll.")
('Feri', 'Oh, I just remembered something. Aida dropped this<br/>when we fought. Here.')
('Van', 'Is that what I think it is?')
('Agnès', "That's...the holo core she used to use?")
('Feri', 'Yup. It is.')
('Feri', "You'd normally return this sort of thing<br/>to Eisenschild.")
('Feri', "But when I asked Commander Geraint if they<br/>wanted it back, he said they didn't need it.")
('Van', "Well, of course they don't. That's 'cause you should<br/>hold on to it, sport.")
('Agnès', "I think so, too. It's only right you keep it.")
('Feri', "Yeah, maybe you guys are right... And it's probably<br/>what Aida wanted, too.")
('Feri', "But she probably didn't want just me to have it.<br/>I think we can all make good use of it.")
('Van', "It's your call, since you knew her better than we did.<br/>Let's keep a hold of it. I'm sure it'll come in handy for<br/>all of us.")
('Van', 'That sound good to you?')
('Feri', 'Yeah, that sounds perfect!')
('System', 'Received a large helping of <br/>.')
('System', 'Received the Sallos holo core.')
('System', "You can now change each party member's holo core.")
('Van', 'I recognize that bike.')
('Hermès', "Sorry to bother you while you're out—but still, I'm<br/>glad I caught you.")
('Van', 'I only know one woman that looks and sounds<br/>like that. Good to see you, Hermès.')
('Hermès', 'Evening, Arkride.')
('Hermès', "Don't think I've seen you since I took on that little<br/>delivery job earlier.")
('Van', 'Guess so. Thanks for that. You were a big help.')
('Van', "I don't think I asked you to come pick anything up<br/>tonight, though. I can't be goin' senile this young.<br/>So what's up?")
('Hermès', 'Your CID buddy had something he wanted to<br/>give you.')
('Hermès', 'Said it was thanks for taking care of some<br/>wanted monster. And that he was throwing in a little<br/>something extra, like you asked.')
('Hermès', 'Here you go. All yours.')
('System', 'Obtained <br/>.')
('System', 'Obtained <br/>.')
('Van', "An arts driver? Nice. That'll come in handy.")
('Van', 'Guess he was feeling pretty generous.')
('Van', "Hell, I'm surprised he took me seriously. Not that<br/>I'm complainin'.")
('Hermès', "I don't know what the deal is between the two of you,<br/>but it's probably a sign that he trusts you enough to<br/>rely on you.")
('Hermès', 'Anyway, my job here is done.')
('Van', 'Thanks for getting it to me. I appreciate you doing<br/>that on a night like this.')
('Hermès', "All in a day's work.")
('Hermès', "Actually, there's something else I wanted to tell you<br/>since you're here, Arkride.")
('Hermès', "I just started a new special delivery service I'm<br/>offering only to my most loyal customers.")
('Hermès', "If you need food, meds, weapons, whatever, just ask<br/>and I'll run out and grab it for you. Sweet deal, right?")
('Van', "Yeah. That's real convenient.")
('Hermès', "Of course, nothing's free. I still expect a commission<br/>for my trouble, and it can only be stuff that's available<br/>here in Edith.")
('Hermès', "But if that works for you, just hit me up whenever you<br/>need something and I'll get it straight to you as soon<br/>as humanly possible.")
('Hermès', 'Got any questions?')
('Van', "Nah. All's clear. Expect me to take advantage of it in<br/>the future.")
('Hermès', "Looking forward to it. Well, I don't want to keep my<br/>next customer waiting, so I'll get going. Good night.")
('Agnès', 'Is that the new device?')
('Risette', 'Yes. This is a beta version of the Virtual Combat<br/>Simulator the Marduk Company is currently testing.')
('Van', 'Virtual, huh? That sounds pretty neat.')
('Feri', 'Can we really use it for combat training?')
('Aaron', 'Can you seriously use that thing for combat training?')
('Risette', 'Indeed. It connects to each of your Xiphas in order to<br/>facilitate it.')
('Risette', "However, please bear in mind that the simulator<br/>interfaces with the user's neurotransmitters.<br/>Damage received will be felt, so do be careful.")
('Agnès', "It's impressive it can do so much. It would make<br/>things easier to actually be in the situation, even if it's<br/>just a simulation.")
('Van', "The nuts and bolts of how it all works go way above<br/>my head, but it's gonna come in handy so we can be<br/>on the top of our game.")
('System', 'Arkride Solutions Office<br/>Complicated Matters Only')
('Agnès', 'Umm...')

('Van', 'First thing in the morning...?')
('Van', 'Uhh...')
('Van', "You're, uh, not really here with a job, right?")
('Agnès', 'I-I am!')
('Agnès', "I have something I'd really like your help with, so if<br/>you don't mind, sir...")
('Feri', '...?!')
('Feri', "Ugh. Where'd they go?")
('Feri', "They're just...gone. How?")
('Van', 'Hah. Got some speed on you.')
('Feri', '...?!')
('Van', "Got'cha!")
('Feri', 'Ack!')

('System', "This door leads to the men's bath.")
('System', "This door leads to the women's bath.")

('System', "Excuse me? What do you mean, 'Look for someone<br/>at work'?! You're not seriously expecting me to<br/>do that?!")
('Van', "Guess I'll order a little somethin' from Hermès.")
