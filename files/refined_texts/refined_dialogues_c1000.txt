('President Gramheart', 'Thanks in no small part to your assistance, we were<br/>able to eliminate the criminal organization that was<br/>responsible for this heinous act.')
('President Gramheart', 'Though I realize that will never bring back the lives<br/>that have been lost.')
('President Gramheart', "As this country's commander in chief, I am deeply<br/>ashamed that I let such a tragedy happen under<br/>my watch.")

('President Gramheart', 'That was a wonderful ceremony. Thank<br/>you, Archbishop. And I thank the ladies and<br/>gentlemen of the choir as well.')
('President Gramheart', 'The road to success is paved with hardship—and the<br/>road this nation has walked has not been without<br/>its challenges.')
('President Gramheart', 'Those challenges include our longstanding conflict<br/>with the Empire, the economic crises of<br/>recent years...')
('President Gramheart', '...and even that wretched cult that existed in our<br/>country until ten years prior.')

('President Gramheart', "The main cannon's raw power measures up to theirs,<br/>and they are capable of firing nearly three times<br/>the distance.")
('President Gramheart', 'Next, we have an entirely new addition to our<br/>military—the Ix-Alba series of aerial cruisers.')
('President Gramheart', 'They are 120 arge long, which places them between<br/>our battleships and mid-sized airships in size.')
('President Gramheart', 'They are equipped with highly advanced weaponry,<br/>and their cutting-edge control systems allow them to<br/>conduct operations with complete autonomy.')
('President Gramheart', 'Based on our recent field tests, we have concluded<br/>that even one of these cruisers can dominate an entire<br/>squadron of Imperial airships.')
('President Gramheart', 'And last—but certainly not least—I will introduce<br/>you to a new class of weaponry.')

('President Gramheart', 'Their control systems utilize Xipha technology, which<br/>maximizes their performance and strengthens their<br/>output, mobility, and reaction speed.')
('President Gramheart', "Their potential is limitless. Not even the Empire's<br/>latest Panzer Soldat models can compare.")
('President Gramheart', "It goes without saying that power must always be<br/>used responsibly. We've learned that lesson from the<br/>Empire's past transgressions.")
('President Gramheart', 'I swear to you today that we will not use our military<br/>as an unwieldy instrument of conquest<br/>and bloodshed.')
('President Gramheart', 'Instead, it shall serve as a firm—yet flexible—tool<br/>that can respond to any situation or crises that<br/>may arise.')
('President Gramheart', 'It is my belief that the weapons you have seen today<br/>will help us build a better road for our future.')

('Risette', 'I take it you made use of investigative shards to<br/>research that information?')
('Elaine', "That's right. Thank you for recommending those to<br/>me, by the way. They certainly come in handy.")
('Elaine', "Though I wasn't able to use them to see inside the<br/>tower itself.")
('Elaine', "I wonder if there's a condition we need to meet in<br/>order to access it.")
('Van', "Wouldn't surprise me.")
('Van', "But don't worry about it. As long as Agnès and I are<br/>here, we'll find our way in.")
('Agnès', 'Van...')

('Agnès', "We're counting on you!")
('Feri', "We couldn't ask for a more dependable guide!")
('Judith', 'Aaargh! She just stole the lead role. And I thought I<br/>was the thief!')
('Aaron', "Okay, then. Let's go pulverize some pillars!")
('Risette', 'I expect them to be stronger than the demon spheres.')
('Quatre', "You're right, but they don't seem to have separate<br/>spaces inside them.")
('Bergard', 'I doubt it will be that difficult to take them<br/>down, then.')
('Van', "Good. Then let's do this, guys!")
('Quatre', 'Right! / All right! / Okay! / Very well!')
('System', 'Elaine has temporarily joined the party as a guest.')

('Zin the Immovable', "You're looking tired over there, Arkride. Don't go<br/>getting rusty on me, now.")
('Van', "Hey, I didn't see YOU haulin' ass all over the place!<br/>I was gettin' shit done!")
('Fie', "Save the banter for later. We've got work to do!")
('Shizuna', "I've been DYING for an extra bit of excitement!<br/>This is my lucky day!")
('Van', "Your timing's always a little too perfect for my liking.")
('Cao', 'It is nothing more than coincidence, I assure you.<br/>We just happened to arrive at the right time.')
('Rixia', 'You can leave the rest to us!')
('Naje', 'Heheh. Here we go!')
('Walter the Direwolf', "Better pick up the pace, or there'll be nothin' but<br/>scraps for the rest of ya!")

('Feri', "Oh, no! The final barrier's still there!")
('Elaine', "And it's been reinforced, too.")
('Agnès', 'It might be more than twice as strong now...')
('Van', "Bah. Guess we've got no other choice.")
('Van', "Agnès, Elaine, step back. I'll take it from here.")
('Elaine', 'What?!')
('Agnès', "You can't be...")
('Van', "I can't count on Mare right now, but I think I'll still<br/>be able to transform.")
('Van', 'Should be totally doable with all this spiritual energy<br/>in the air.')
('Elaine', '...')
('Quatre', "Wh-What's that black aura?")
('Aaron', 'What the hell are you doing, dude?')
('Bergard', "Don't! Not while in Pandemonium!")

('Risette', 'What are you doing here?')
('President Gramheart', 'I would like to know the answer to that as well.')
('Quatre', 'An Assault Frame?!')
('Feri', 'Th-That sounded like...')
('Agnès', 'D-Dad?!')
('President Gramheart', 'Kincaid gave me the rundown of the situation.')
('President Gramheart', 'I never intended to meddle in affairs unrelated to<br/>politics, but given the circumstances, I believe I can<br/>be forgiven this time!')
('Harwood', 'Aww. Daddy left work early to help his little girl.<br/>How sweet.')
('Harwood', 'And you brought the big guns, too. I know you had<br/>experience in the army, but you piloting that thing so<br/>well might raise a few eyebrows.')
('President Gramheart', "I beg to differ. It's only natural that a president is fully<br/>prepared to act on behalf of their people.")
('President Gramheart', 'Oh, and by the way, I would thank you to remember<br/>our agreement—NOT overstep your bounds!')
('Harwood', 'Yeah, yeah. Will do, Mr. President!')
('Van', 'Who said you two could just show up out of the blue?')

('President Gramheart', 'All I will ask is that you do your duty. You may<br/>consider this an official request from me.')
('President Gramheart', 'You have witnessed both sides of this country.<br/>That lets you do what no one else can!')

('Agnès', "Dad, Elaine. We'll come back safe and sound. I<br/>swear it!")
(40301, 'Wh-What just happened?')

('Agnès', "No! He hasn't left us! Not yet!")
('Elaine', 'What do you mean?')
('Risette', 'His holo settings screen!')
('Quatre', 'A-Are you thinking of...?')
('Agnès', "It's no good... It's not reacting!")
('Agnès', "Fine, I'll do this, then!")
('Agnès', 'Mare! Please wake up! We need you!')
('Agnès', 'Oh!')
('Elaine', "Wh-What's...?!")
('Mare', "Ugh. Stop yelling. I already told you that I'm awake...")
('Agnès', "Mare! You have to tell us where Van's gone!<br/>Please, we're begging you!")
('Agnès', "If you're here, that has to mean he's close by, right?!")
('Aaron', 'What?!')
('Feri', 'R-Really?!')
('Quatre', 'Th-That does make sense, actually. Van is the only<br/>one capable of calling Mare normally...')
('Risette', "All this time, she has been watching over him for<br/>some unknown reason... No, perhaps it's more<br/>accurate to say she's monitoring him.")
('Judith', "So if she's still active, that means...")
('Mare', "...Yes, that's correct. He's still here in this dimension.")
('Mare', 'However, he has already made his choice.')
('Mare', 'He decided to free himself of his restraints—or the<br/>Grendel, as you call it—and accept the power that is<br/>rightfully his.')
('Mare', 'Now a world-devouring demon lord lingers<br/>inside him. He chose to seal it away within the<br/>void—and himself with it.')
('Aaron', 'That bastard!')
('Feri', 'H-How could he do that?!')
('Van', "Okay. It's a promise.")
('Van', "But I want you all to remember that we ain't heroes<br/>of justice. There's no shame in turnin' tail if things go<br/>to shit.")
('Van', "The fate of the world's important and all, but our lives<br/>are, too. We ain't gonna throw 'em away.")
('Van', "Know your limits, and don't worry about what's black<br/>or white. That's the spriggan creed, and we're gonna<br/>follow it like always.")
('Van', "And once we've returned the city to normal, life will<br/>all go back to the way it was.")
('Van', "And that'll pay for all the sweets and sauna trips we<br/>could ever want!")
('Quatre', 'Every word that came out of his mouth was a lie!')
('Risette', 'This is a flagrant violation of our contract. I will not<br/>stand for it!')
('Judith', "I... Urgh! I'm gonna punch him SO hard! He's in for<br/>the pummeling of the century!")
('Elaine', 'E-Easy, everyone...')
('Bergard', 'I had an inkling about what he was trying to do.')
('Bergard', 'I suspected that he harbored guilt about remaining in<br/>this world.')
('Bergard', 'In the distant past, five demon lords were added to<br/>the seventy-two devils that resided in Gehenna.')
('Bergard', 'And it was at this moment when the world<br/>was rewritten... At least, that is what I and the<br/>church believe.')
('Bergard', 'Regardless, I can only imagine how he felt when he<br/>learned that he was one of those demon lords.')
('Elaine', '...?!')
('Agnès', 'Y-You mentioned that before...')
('Aaron', "You're making all this shit up. No way!")
('Bergard', "It's a closely guarded secret even within the church,<br/>but its veracity can be proved.")
('Bergard', 'It accounts for the discrepancies between the records<br/>from before the Great Collapse—which are kept in<br/>the primal grounds—and after.')
('Bergard', 'The being that resides within Van is called the<br/>Vagrant Demon Lord.')
('Bergard', 'The Book of Ezer describes it as a being that is<br/>imbued with the power of black time.')
('Risette', 'One of the Dominions told us of that book.')
('Feri', "So that's Van's story...")
('Bergard', 'However, I did not know of his true desire, nor did I<br/>see the depths of his despair.')
('Bergard', 'No man is an island. Every human must rely on<br/>others, and Van is no exception.')
('Bergard', 'But I see now that I did not make him realize as<br/>much—and that is my greatest failing as his master.')
('Bergard', 'So, I implore you, Mare.')
('Bergard', 'Grant them the opportunity to confront my<br/>fool of student—so they may voice their<br/>complaints to him directly.')
('Mare', "Y-You're overwhelming me! Stop it!")
('Mare', "Okay, okay! I'll help—even if I REALLY shouldn't,<br/>considering I'm a ㌍㌫㌻㍊㌫. I'll at least give you a<br/>hint, though.")
('Mare', "Go to the place that he has the strongest emotional<br/>attachment to. You'll find him there.")
('Mare', "There isn't much time left before he's gone for good,<br/>so if you want to go after him, you'd better hurry.")
('Elaine', '...')
('Bergard', 'You should go with them, too!')
('Elaine', 'R-Right!')
('Yumé', 'Oh! Hey, guys!')
('Van', "Hey there, you two. Havin' fun with the ol' champ?")
('Maxim', "A-Ah, yeah, I invited 'em a while back.")
('Maxim', 'Thanks, Paulette. I really appreciate i—')
('Paulette', 'Please, think nothing of it.')
('Paulette', 'And besides...I have motives of my own.')
('Maxim', "Ack! Wh-What's that supposed to mean?!")
('Yumé', 'Whaaat?!')
('Maxim', 'Aieee! Again?!')
('Yumé', 'Ooh, ooh, can I get some ice cream?')
('Yumé', 'And I wanna get some popcorn and yakisoba with<br/>Mommy, too! I wanna know which is yummier!')
('Yumé', "But right now, I wanna play tag! You're<br/>it, Maxim!")
('Maxim', "Whoa, slow down there! I, uhh... Today, I<br/>was thinkin'...")
('Yumé', "You don't wanna play with me? Aww...")
('Paulette', 'Maxim...?')
('Maxim', "Was thinkin' maybe we could take a nice drive<br/>around the city. I wanted to visit Trion Tower, too,<br/>and have a nice dinner to ourselves tonight...")
('Maxim', "Was hopin' I could talk to Paulette about some stuff,<br/>mainly, but... Ah, nuts to that!")
('Maxim', "You want a race, you've got one! I'mma get you, you<br/>little rascal!")
('Yumé', 'Yay, hahaha! Catch me if you caaan!')
('Paulette', 'Ah, it warms my heart...')
('Agnès', "It's good to see Yumé and Maxim getting closer.")
('Feri', "He's really getting along with Yumé... It's great<br/>to see!")
('Aaron', 'Well, would you look at that? Playboy fancies himself<br/>a family man.')
('Risette', 'I see Mr. Lugan is getting along well with the<br/>young miss.')
('Quatre', 'So Maxim is spending time with Yumé, now... I see.')
('Judith', "That's no act—he's really putting himself out there.<br/>Good!")
('Bergard', "It is good to see that he's trying to make amends—<br/>there's nothing to be gained from bad blood.")
('Van', "So you accepted his invitation for Yumé's sake...?")
('Van', 'Or, no. Was it something about him specifically?')
('Paulette', "Good question. To be honest with you, I'm not<br/>entirely sure.")
('Paulette', 'What I want is for him to get a clear look at who I<br/>am today. Once he has present me in his head, and<br/>moves on from past me...then, we can talk.')
('Van', 'I see...')
('Van', "(Feel like she's overthinking this whole 'makeup'<br/>thing, but eh. Not my business.)")
('System', 'After touring the stands with Yumé for a while, the<br/>team went back on the job.')
('System', 'Break the Demonic Pillar?')
('System', 'Break the Demonic Pillar?')
('System', 'Break the Demonic Pillar?')
('System', 'Break the Demonic Pillar?')
('Van', '(Oh, right. Those street racers asked me to scout<br/>some people.)')
('Van', '(I know a guy who could help with that...)')
('Van', "(...but he looks like he's havin' a grand ol' time<br/>over there. Do I bug him?)")
('Maxim', "Uh...yeah? What's up? You're kinda freakin' me out<br/>with that stare of yours.")
('Maxim', "Don't tell me I did something wrong? I do one of<br/>those, whatsit, 'faux-pas'? S-Stop lookin' at me<br/>like that!")
('Maxim', 'You coulda just told me, man! Paulette already has<br/>enough reasons to hate my guts!')
('Van', "Hey, hey, hold your horses, champ. Just wanted to ask<br/>you about somethin'—favor, actually.")
('Van', "Mind if I borrow him for a bit, Paulette? It's for a job.")
('Paulette', 'Oh, by all means.')
('Yumé', "You've got work stuff? Okay!")
('Van', 'Okay, so, these guys roped me into a street race.<br/>Thought that might be up your alley, too.')
('Van', "But I know you're havin' fun with your family, and I<br/>get pros foolin' around in unsanctioned street races<br/>ain't a good look.")
('Van', "Bit of a shot in the dark here, but I figured I'd at least<br/>ask: that pique your interest at all?")
('Maxim', 'A street race, huh? Hmm... If I did that, I might<br/>attract the attention of some scoop-loving ink<br/>slingers...again...')
('Maxim', '...Eh. What the hey? Count me in!')
('Van', 'Cool! But, uhh, surprised you said yes. What about<br/>the kid?')
('Maxim', "Heh. I thought you of all people might have guessed:<br/>I've got a score to settle with you.")
('Maxim', "You beat me once, but I'm not the kinda guy to take a<br/>loss lying down.")
('Maxim', "And the reporters? Thinkin' about it, they've got<br/>bigger things to cover than me. Any journo worth<br/>their salt is gonna be at the festival.")
('Maxim', 'Besides...maybe Paulette needs a break from me, just<br/>for a little bit.')
('Maxim', "Wouldn't hurt to give her a moment to herself.")
('Van', "Is that right? Heh, fine by me. You wanna go again,<br/>I'll give you another dust cloud to dine on.")
('Van', "...Don't actually know what kind of race it is, though.")
('Maxim', "Well, whatever it is, I'm lookin' forward to it!")
('Maxim', "I'll head over later, and we can meet back up there.")
('Van', 'You got it.')
('Van', "Well, I've hit up everyone I can think of.")
('Van', "Guess all that's left is to loop back with the racers.")
('Van', "Well, I've hit up everyone I can think of.")
('Van', "Guess all that's left is to loop back with the racers.")
('Agnès', 'Wow...! Everything looks so small from up here!')
('Agnès', "I'm almost scared to look down... I feel like I<br/>might fall!")
('Van', "Yeah, this view's takin' my breath away.")
('Van', 'Never ridden in an airship like this one before.<br/>Pretty neat, gotta say.')
('Prince Sherid', "I'm glad to hear it! It's always a pleasure to put a smile<br/>on people's faces.")
('Van', "Oh, hey! Didn't see you when we boarded.")
('Agnès', 'Thank you very much for inviting us.')
('Naje', 'Our pleasure. We were already here on a diplomatic<br/>visit to strengthen our relations with the Republic.')
('Prince Sherid', 'We decided to borrow this idea from Oración...')
('Prince Sherid', "...and since you've been such a great help for us, Ms.<br/>Agnès, it's only fair that we extend an invitation<br/>to you.")
('Agnès', 'Really, I should be the one thanking you! That you<br/>would welcome us aboard your airship without a<br/>second thought...')
('Prince Sherid', 'Come now, it was my pleasure.')
('Prince Sherid', "I'd rather you have fun than feel indebted—this is a<br/>sightseeing flight, after all.")
('Prince Sherid', "We'll be around seeing the sights ourselves, if you<br/>need us. You two have a wonderful time, now!")
('Naje', "If there's anything we can help with, feel free to ask.")
('Van', 'Hah. Enigmatic as ever, the guy.')
('Agnès', "It's good to see they're enjoying themselves, though.")
('Yumé', 'Ooh, Van! Agnès! Is that Montmart down there?<br/>It looks so tiny!')
('Van', "Hmm... Can't really tell from here. Everything else is<br/>tiny, too.")
('Van', "Look all you want, but don't throw yourself<br/>overboard, yeah?")
('Yumé', 'Duh! I know better than that!')
('Yumé', "This airship is sooo coooool! I didn't know they could<br/>fly this high!")
('Yumé', 'But how does a ship this big fly in the sky, anyway?')
('Agnès', "That's a good question! And the answer is one of the<br/>greatest breakthroughs in orbal technology.")
('Agnès', "This airship's flight engine converts orbal energy into<br/>an anti-gravity field. That field is used to generate<br/>lift by...")
('Agnès', '...er, perhaps this is a bit too intricate for you, on<br/>second thought.')
('Yumé', "No, no, I get it! Tell me more! Anti-gravity?<br/>That's awesome!")
('Van', 'You really know your stuff.')
('Agnès', 'Admittedly, the incident in Oración piqued my<br/>interest on airship mechanics.')
('Agnès', 'I decided to brush up on engineering textbooks and<br/>airship documents, when I had the time.')
('Van', 'Did you, now? Props.')
('Harry', "What'cha talking about? I wanna know!")
('Mark', "I'm interested in airships, too!")
('Van', "Haha! Come one, come all to Professor Claudel's<br/>Orbal Airships 101!")
('Agnès', "Please, I'm no teacher...")
('Agnès', 'But it looks like my studying has come in<br/>handy, heehee!')
('Agnès', 'So, in simpler terms, an airship flies by...')
('System', "Agnès' impromptu engineering lecture had the<br/>kids spellbound.")
('System', 'The passengers then moved on to a special event in<br/>the seating area, leaving Van and Agnès to themselves<br/>on the deck.')
('Van', "Heh heh! You did good handling the li'l buggers.")
('Van', "Even got 'em to follow along with the actual science<br/>a bit. You'd make a great teacher, I think.")
('Agnès', 'Well, it helped that they were all so eager to learn in<br/>the first place. All I did was sate their curiosity!')
('Agnès', "Ah! There's Trion Tower. It looks so majestic from<br/>up here...")
('Van', "Ain't a landmark for nothin'. This really makes you<br/>appreciate how big it is.")
('Agnès', 'As it so happens, my great-grandfather was behind<br/>its design.')
('Van', 'Was he? Looks awful modern for how old it is.')
('Van', "But that's Epstein for you.")
('Agnès', 'He always was thinking ahead.')
('Agnès', 'He played a role in the invention of airships as well.')
('Agnès', 'He formed his theory on orbal anti-gravity based on<br/>data collected from the Geneses.')
('Agnès', 'One of his students, Professor Russell, extrapolated<br/>that theory and turned it into a functioning<br/>flight engine. The rest, as they say, is history!')
('Van', "Man, sometimes I can't tell if you're just makin' stuff<br/>up about him.")
('Van', 'So he laid the groundwork that eventually got us<br/>up here?')
('Agnès', 'Well, that reduces it a little, but yes.')
('Agnès', "My great-grandfather's research powers all these<br/>things we enjoy—powers happiness the world over.")
('Agnès', 'Thinking about it like that, it...it really makes<br/>me happy.')
('Van', "Yeah... And that's why you've been feeling<br/>uneasy lately?")
('Van', "Now we've got these new weapons, this arms race<br/>between the Assault Frame and the Panzer Soldats...<br/>I can tell it's all gettin' you antsy.")
('Agnès', "I... I can't hide anything from you, can I?")
('Agnès', "In his diaries, my great-grandfather wrote at length<br/>about wanting to enrich people's lives with<br/>orbal technology.")
('Agnès', 'He dreamed of finding a way for people—for the<br/>whole world—to coexist with each other.')
('Agnès', 'But in this day and age, those ideals have<br/>been clouded... Military development marches on,<br/>using orbal technology for war.')
('Agnès', "And one of the foremost figures pushing for the<br/>Republic's militarization is...well, President<br/>Gramheart. His grandson, and my father.")
('Agnès', 'Sometimes, I just... I feel helpless, thinking about it.')
('Van', "I think that's a problem for all of us—you shouldn't<br/>feel like you have to shoulder it all by yourself.")
('Van', "But I get why it's important to you: it's personal.")
('Agnès', "Exactly. There's this one passage from his diaries that<br/>I always come back to:")
('Agnès', "'Orbal technology will grant man the power to<br/>reshape the entire world.'")
('Agnès', "'And man will misstep on this new journey...but<br/>eventually, he will find a path that leads to truth<br/>and harmony.'")
('Agnès', 'He then discussed what those missteps might be, and<br/>what developments might come with them.')
('Agnès', 'Chief among his worries was the arms race we see<br/>today—an insatiable lust for power...')
('Agnès', "Power that perhaps we weren't meant to wield.")
('Van', "Come to think of it, he first pushed the idea of<br/>singularities, too, didn't he?")
('Van', 'I kinda get it, but it all just sounds so ludicrous to me.')
('Van', 'But, well, if anybody knew their orbal stuff, it<br/>was him. Hard not to take his word for it.')
('Agnès', "I'm just...confused. On one hand, I have my<br/>great-grandfather, who saw in orbments an<br/>instrument of peace...")
('Agnès', "...and on the other hand, I have my father, who's<br/>using orbments to lead this country down a dark and<br/>disturbing path.")
('Agnès', "What do I do with myself? What do I do with<br/>the future? I feel like I'm being swept up in this tide<br/>of change...and I'm powerless to stop it.")
('Van', "...You ask me, though? I think your great-grandpa's<br/>smilin' from up there.")
('Agnès', 'What do you mean?')
('Van', "You're workin' with a spriggan, you're stickin' it to A,<br/>you've even been takin' the Geneses back...")
('Van', "Hell, even went to Oración against your dad's wishes.")
('Van', "None of that would've happened if you didn't take<br/>these things so seriously.")
('Agnès', "I... Well... But I feel like all of those things just<br/>happened around me. I've only ever been searching<br/>for what I need to do, what my purpose is...")
('Van', 'But it takes a certain kinda person to look for that<br/>purpose to begin with.')
('Van', "So the way I look at it, you're doin' him<br/>mighty proud.")
('Van', "It's clear to me you care a lot about your family and<br/>your country...")
('Van', "...and that's why what you're doin' makes sense to me.<br/>You want the power to see your decision through<br/>when you finally do make it. Am I right?")
('Agnès', 'I...')
('Agnès', "Well, maybe you're right. I've still got a long way to<br/>go, but I think I'm getting there, step by step.")
('Agnès', "That's all I can do for now: just keep moving and<br/>keep learning about the world around me.")
('Agnès', "Trusting my great-grandfather's visions for the<br/>future... Trusting my father's leadership<br/>as President...")
('Agnès', "And trusting myself, with my curious little job that's<br/>neither black nor white.")
('Van', "Haha! That's the spirit!")
('Agnès', 'I really do owe you a lot, Van... I see my life in a<br/>much different way than before. I have you to thank<br/>for that.')
('Agnès', "I WILL repay you some day—of that, I'm sure!")
('Van', "Bah, it's nothin'. I was just a mirror for you, is all.")
('Van', "Way things are goin', I think we'll have this Geneses<br/>business taken care of soon, too. Just gotta take things<br/>as they come, yeah?")
('Agnès', 'I do hope so.')
(40301, "Attention, passengers: we hope you've enjoyed your<br/>trip in the skies above Edith.")
(40301, 'We will be landing back at the airport shortly.')
(40301, 'We ask all passengers on the deck to please return to<br/>your seats and remain seated for landing.')
('Agnès', "Has it really been that long? I hardly feel any time's<br/>passed at all.")
('Van', "Time flies when you're having fun on an airship, eh?")
('Van', "'Bout time we head back, now. Back to that big<br/>metropolis with plenty happenin' above and beneath<br/>it...back to our little town.")
('System', 'Van, Agnès, and Yumé enjoyed their flight to<br/>the fullest...')
('System', '...and after saying their goodbyes to Prince Sherid,<br/>they disembarked and returned to Edith.')
('System', "Look, but don't touch, please. Keep your distance.")
('Van', "Oh. 'Scuse me.")
