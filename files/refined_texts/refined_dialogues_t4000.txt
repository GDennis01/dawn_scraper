('Station Worker Cordeaux', 'Last night there was a problem with the eastern rails,<br/>causing a delay.')
('Station Worker Cordeaux', "Everything's back in order, though, so east-bound<br/>train traffic should resume this morning.")
('Station Worker Cordeaux', "I'm sympathetic to the passengers who got delayed,<br/>but it's just a fact of life that you see this happen east<br/>of Longlai every now and then.")
('Station Worker Cordeaux', "I gather the rail company's trying to address the issue,<br/>but they haven't solved the fundamental<br/>problem, unfortunately.")
('Station Worker Cordeaux', "That being said, there's quite a number of people in<br/>the lurch this time.")
('Station Worker Cordeaux', "Last night a lady from an NGO happened by.<br/>Professor Hamilton's been working to find the cause<br/>of the desertification, and is bringing in help.")
('Station Worker Cordeaux', 'Perhaps the Transcontinental Railroad still has some<br/>hope after all.')
('Station Worker Cordeaux', 'A little while ago, I saw a man from the East who<br/>came here for work visiting the temple... It seems<br/>things are rough.')
('Station Worker Cordeaux', 'Working here at the station, you meet a fair number<br/>of immigrants. Seems like things are rough all over<br/>these days.')
('Station Worker Cordeaux', "Maybe if the Transcontinental Railroad had been<br/>able to operate as planned, things wouldn't be so hard<br/>for them...")
('Station Worker Cordeaux', "Welcome to Longlai, Doorway to the East. I see<br/>you've come by automobile?")
('Station Worker Cordeaux', 'Ours is a small town, but the main line of the<br/>Transcontinental Railroad runs through here. I hope<br/>you get to ride it someday.')
('Station Worker Cordeaux', "Oh, yeah! To reach the eastbound train, you'll need to<br/>change over on the platform on the opposite side of<br/>the station.")
('Station Worker Cordeaux', "There's still a train every few days, but...well, I think<br/>things are unstable out that way, what with the<br/>environmental problems and all.")
('Station Worker Cordeaux', "Hmm... There aren't as many as there once were,<br/>but still...")
('Station Worker Cordeaux', 'Even these days, many people of Eastern heritage<br/>pass through this city.')
('Station Worker Cordeaux', 'Nowadays, to keep things convenient for train-goers,<br/>you can go through customs procedures inside<br/>the station.')
('Rito', "Now, then, I'm off to take care of the tea plants.<br/>Have to do what I can now for next year's crop.")
('Rito', "That fog might've been thick as soup this morning,<br/>but it doesn't seem to have harmed things much.")
('Rito', "If I start preparing things now, we'll have excellent<br/>tea next year, too.")
('Rito', "Ahh... A good day's work, a dip in the springs, and<br/>then a cup of tea. This, my dears, is living.")
('Rito', "And our tea's a real hit with the tourists. That's what<br/>really makes working on a 'specialty' like this worth it.")
('Rito', "Seeing new faces enjoying the fruits of your labor...<br/>there's no other feeling like it.")
('Rito', 'Hello there. Tourists, are you? Welcome to Longlai.')
('Rito', "I'm sorry to say you've come at the wrong season<br/>for tea-growing. They're a sight in the summer, let<br/>me tell you!")
('Rito', "Still, it's just the season for autumnal reds. Not as<br/>great as fresh tea leaves, but I'm sure you'll love it.")
('Rito', 'When you work on growing a local specialty, seeing<br/>visitors enjoying your work is the real payoff.')
('Rito', "You probably didn't know, but black tea, green tea,<br/>matcha, and oolong tea can all be made from the<br/>same tea leaves.")
('Rito', "The difference actually lies in when you harvest them<br/>and how you process them. That's where tea<br/>gets interesting.")
('Ludesia', 'Sounds like the eastbound train is scheduled to depart<br/>just before noon.')
('Ludesia', "The inn that put me up for the night gave me their<br/>best wishes. I've got to do my very best on this!")
('Ludesia', "I'll go out, expand my horizons, and contribute<br/>everything I can!")
('Ludesia', "The eastbound line of the Transcontinental Railroad<br/>was delayed, I guess? I'd made all my preparations,<br/>and now there's no train today.")
('Ludesia', "But this is another problem caused by the<br/>environmental issues eastern Zemuria is facing.<br/>I'm sure a lot of people have it tougher than me.")
('Ludesia', "There aren't a lot of people passing through Longlai<br/>lately, and folks here in Calvard tend to forget about<br/>what's happening out there.")
('Ludesia', 'Which is exactly why people like my group have to<br/>stick with them till the very end!')
('Ludesia', "The group I'm with is still pretty small, but we're<br/>blessed with someone who can do anything perfectly.<br/>Deskwork, whatever, you name it.")
('Ludesia', "The amazing thing is that this person's also a...school<br/>teacher, I think? Anyway, they're even younger than<br/>me, to boot!")
('Ludesia', "I'd say I have to work harder not to look bad, but I'm<br/>just incredibly proud to work with someone<br/>so motivated!")
('Ludesia', "Well, hello Doorway to the East. Here's my chance<br/>to get everything I need before I head out!")
('Ludesia', "I couldn't get out here in time for the direct line, but<br/>hey, that gives me a chance to actually prepare.")
('Ludesia', "There's a lot of people hoping for our support across<br/>the mountains...")
('Ludesia', "I've never gone this far east before, but as a proud<br/>NGO worker, I've got to do everything I can!")
('Gengfu', "Goodness, the fog is thick! It's not terribly common<br/>to see fog like this off the Kunlun Mountains in<br/>this season.")
('Gengfu', "Yet it's times like these that sharpen the senses—<br/>enough to feel even the faintest changes in the energy<br/>of the land...")
('Gengfu', '...What? What is this bone-chilling sensation?!')
('Gengfu', "I've trained here for many years, but I've never felt<br/>something like this. ...Ahh, it's no good! I can't get a<br/>grasp on it.")
('Gengfu', "I can't get into the Kunlun Mountains, but there's<br/>other worthy places to train.")
('Gengfu', 'Most important of all is to ensure one maintains an<br/>even heart in the face of the unexpected, and calmly<br/>determine a course of action.')
('Gengfu', 'Though... It, erm, seems this trail closure will hold for<br/>longer than expected. I should go tell my<br/>fellow students.')
('Gengfu', "I'm part of the Gekka school, but every time I come<br/>to visit, I find new reasons to respect the<br/>Taito school.")
('Gengfu', 'I think that the mentality of the Taito school, born of<br/>Longlai, is something we of Gekka can take to heart.')
('Gengfu', "I can't do anything for them, but they have my best<br/>wishes in rebuilding their dojo.")
('Gengfu', "Hmm... So the Kunlun Mountains are still off limits?<br/>I gather it's some decision handed down by<br/>the government.")
('Gengfu', 'Yet as a member of the Gekka school, I come here<br/>every year to train in those mountains.')
('Gengfu', "I suppose this year I'll have to admit defeat to<br/>the circumstances. Besides, it isn't like there aren't<br/>other places to train.")
('Gengfu', 'The Kunlun Mountains have long been known as a<br/>place to train, in part precisely because of how<br/>treacherous they are.')
('Gengfu', 'Few would go into the mountains except to train, so I<br/>doubt the closure is of any trouble to the people<br/>of Longlai.')
('Sr. Officer Lambert', "I heard about the missing child. I've been speaking to<br/>people in town and ensuring no stone goes unturned.")
('Sr. Officer Lambert', "Especially with the thick fog this morning. I'm very<br/>concerned she might get in a traffic accident, due to<br/>the awful visibility.")
('Sr. Officer Lambert', "If we haven't found any sign of her by noon, then...<br/>well, might be time to contact the border patrol and<br/>have them start searching as well.")
('Sr. Officer Lambert', 'On my night patrol, one of the locals invited me<br/>to drink.')
('Sr. Officer Lambert', "Naturally, I don't drink on duty, so I simply had a<br/>quick bite to eat instead. Did appreciate the<br/>thought, however.")
('Sr. Officer Lambert', 'I was regrettably unfamiliar with Eastern culture<br/>when I first came here, but the folks here have done a<br/>lot to help me fit in.')
('Sr. Officer Lambert', "Maybe it wasn't just coincidence that landed me here.<br/>Either way, the best thing I can do in return is do my<br/>duty to my utmost!")
('Sr. Officer Lambert', "Welcome to Longlai. We're a border city, but as you<br/>can see, we're pretty quiet, all told. I hope you have a<br/>relaxing time here.")
('Sr. Officer Lambert', "There's still a number of folks from the East passing<br/>through, but nowadays customs are done at the train<br/>station or border crossing.")
('Sr. Officer Lambert', 'These days, I focus on keeping peace in town,<br/>and help visitors with any trouble they run into.')
('Sr. Officer Lambert', "Of course, with how peaceful it is, that's not too hard.<br/>If you need anything, come by anytime. Trust me,<br/>you won't be a bother.")
('Guide Senri', "It's been a while since I saw Yumé. I hope you can<br/>find her.")
('Guide Senri', "For as much energy as she's got, she seemed kinda<br/>different when I saw her. And, like, not in a<br/>good way.")
('Guide Senri', "I'll bounce from work early and go look with the rest<br/>of the Tourism Bureau.")
('Guide Senri', "As a guide, I'm pretty familiar with the parts of the<br/>city where people tend to get lost.")
('Guide Senri', "My mom's food is always the best!")
('Guide Senri', 'She was the one who helped me get a job as a guide,<br/>and she even packs me lunch so I can do my best<br/>at work! Moms are great.')
('Guide Senri', "Looking for dinner? For what it's worth, guests<br/>always go nuts for my mom's cooking.")
('Guide Senri', "We'll keep an eye on your kid, so please go find the<br/>other guest.")
('Guide Senri', "I don't get it, I told her it was dangerous up there.<br/>What did she even want to do?")
('Guide Senri', "Oh, yeah. This is the season for waterfall viewing.<br/>It's really lovely right about now.")
('Guide Senri', "That said, there's a fallen tree so it's a no-go right<br/>now. Though, uh, there's lots of other lovely sights to<br/>take in!")
('Yumé', "Wow! Why's a kid showing these two old<br/>folks around?")
('Guide Senri', "H-Hey! Rude! And...wait! You're even younger than<br/>I am!")
('Guide Senri', "I'm a part-timer with the Tourism Bureau.<br/>Mom asked me to help out—and she even gave me<br/>an allowance, too!")
('Yumé', "Your name's 'part-timer?' Wow! You've got a<br/>funny name!")
('Guide Senri', "Uhh... No, that's my job. I'm Senri!")
('Guide Senri', "Well, she's sure...hyper. Umm, so are you<br/>her guardians? Keep a close eye on her. Or...two.<br/>Or three, if you got 'em.")
('Van', "Heh. Yeah, sorry she got in your way. I'll keep an eye<br/>on her, don't worry.")
('Guide Senri', "...Ahem. I hope you'll forgive me. Umm, let me get<br/>back to showing you around.")
('Guide Senri', 'The trees are in their autumn colors, which makes for<br/>an amazing sight at night, with the moon reflecting<br/>off the river.')
('Guide Senri', "Oh, yeah. This is the season for waterfall viewing.<br/>It's really lovely right now.")
('Guide Senri', "That said, there's a fallen tree so it's a no-go right<br/>now. Though, uhh, there's lots of other lovely sights to<br/>take in!")
('Guide Senri', 'Even from town, you can see the valley in all its<br/>autumn colors, and as for other special geography...')
('Guide Senri', "Are you tourists, too? I can show you around later, if<br/>you'd like.")
('Guide Senri', "I'm only a part-timer, but I'm as good as any<br/>professional guide. The Tourism Bureau chief<br/>approved me personally!")
('Walker', 'Ahh, a morning bath is a wonder. Wakes you<br/>right up! Makes you feel vitalized!')
('Walker', "Especially an outdoor bath. Tasting that morning air<br/>while you gaze out at the mountains? Why, I don't<br/>have the words for it.")
('Walker', "A shame I'm leaving tomorrow. I'd have liked to<br/>spend another night in this wonderful, restful place.")
('Walker', 'What a bath that was. I could spend forever in<br/>there, truly. And the dinner! I was a bit surprised at<br/>the style of it, but the taste!')
('Walker', 'Come to think of it, I remember hearing from the<br/>lodge owner that the Divine Blade of the Empire and<br/>his family stayed here rather recently.')
('Walker', "You know, 'Divine Blade' is a name I associate more<br/>with Liberl. I'm sure you know, that is a title<br/>belonging to a national hero of ours.")
('Walker', "I suppose it wasn't THAT Divine Blade who stayed<br/>here, though. Still, it does make me feel connected to<br/>this place, a little.")
('Walker', "All right! We've packed our luggage away, so shall we<br/>go look about, Torte?")
('Walker', 'Ah, this feeling... It was well worth coming all the<br/>way out here from Liberl.')
('Walker', "Of course, even in Liberl, we're loosely familiar with<br/>Eastern culture, but reading of it and experiencing it<br/>are two different things!")
('Walker', 'Also, that guide showed me a few places that<br/>were breathtaking!')
('Torte', "I've never had the chance to slip into a hot spring<br/>right after waking up before, but it really 'warms away'<br/>the sleepiness.")
('Torte', "We've still got some time, so maybe I can scope out a<br/>nice, relaxing massage a bit later.")
('Torte', 'This fog, though. Is this normal weather for Longlai?')
('Torte', "The guidebook did mention the occasional<br/>foggy morning. There's fog and 'fog,' though...")
('Torte', "Ahh, the hot springs here seep into your very bones.<br/>It even loosened up my shoulders. It's unreal!")
('Torte', 'The Hekizanro Inn, with its Eastern-style<br/>hospitality, is something else.')
('Torte', "It's like, they really care about even the finest details.<br/>You can SEE the sincerity of it all. They<br/>actually care.")
('Torte', "It's a very different experience than back in Elmo—<br/>not that I'm knocking their bona-fides. This just feels<br/>more...authentic?")
('Torte', "I can't really put it into words. It just...is.")
('Torte', 'The inn, too, is more than I imagined. It really was<br/>worth saving up our mira for the trip over the past<br/>few years.')
('Rodrigo', "*sniff* That there's the smell of fog...")
('Rodrigo', "Strange. I hadn't heard of fog being common in<br/>this season.")
('Rodrigo', "Still, this fog's kind of great. Fog, mist—it's all part of<br/>the travel experience!")
('Rodrigo', "This isn't just about here, but y'know, local shops<br/>should try selling the air—their fogs and whatnot—as<br/>souvenirs, right? Bottle it!")
('Rodrigo', "You can't beat the smell of this souvenir shop.<br/>You can catch the scents of the wood, the paper,<br/>the materials...")
('Rodrigo', "The dining place on the second floor here's got such<br/>an alluring scent that it even tints what you get<br/>down here. It makes things even better!")
('Rodrigo', "All right! That was a nice bath, so now I'll just go<br/>take in a breath of the night air, and that'll end my<br/>day right.")
('Rodrigo', 'I like the lovely mountains, the feel of the hot springs,<br/>all that, of course. But for me, traveling is as much<br/>about the nose knowing.')
('Rodrigo', "I'm not sure I can express it. It's the scent of the air<br/>that really makes you realize you're in a<br/>different place.")
('Rodrigo', "It's that moment when you get off the train, or when<br/>you wake up in your lodging, embraced by a scent<br/>unlike anything you get at home.")
('Rodrigo', 'For me, those scents really affect my impressions of<br/>the places I travel.')
('Rodrigo', 'I was over at the temple just a bit ago. The scent of<br/>that place? Top class!')
('Rodrigo', 'The scent of the trees and the incense really invokes<br/>that Eastern mood.')
('Rodrigo', 'The Longlai temple serves tea, too, and the tea here<br/>in Longlai has a really mysterious scent to it.')
('Samantha', "Hmm... This fog's quite thick. The guidebook didn't<br/>mention fog being an issue in autumn...")
('Samantha', 'That said, the fog does add a wonderfully mysterious<br/>feel to this Eastern cityscape!')
('Samantha', "I wonder if this is just phenomenally rare? I wish I'd<br/>brought a camera!")
('Samantha', 'I was just going to stop by the temple to get a look at<br/>it, and I ended up taking their little class on tea.')
('Samantha', "I guess tea's an important part of Eastern<br/>hospitality, too. It really is a deep subject, isn't it?")
('Samantha', "While she was teaching me though, I couldn't help<br/>noticing that Mother Izumi carries herself with a sort<br/>of otherworldly grace...")
('Samantha', "The experience was all so very... I feel like I'm about<br/>to discover something about myself!")
('Samantha', "So this is Longlai... It's amazing! Talk about an<br/>Eastern feel!")
('Samantha', "It's different in its own way compared to Langport,<br/>and the geography's quite unique, too. I'm thrilled to<br/>be here!")
('Samantha', 'Where to go first? Hmm... What a hard decision<br/>this is!')
('Ino', 'Daddy sometimes spends nights drinking stuff with<br/>his friends, but he also spends time with me!')
('Ino', "Even when he's with his friends, they sometimes give<br/>me yummy, umm, bar snacks, they call them!")
('Ino', "Dad and his friends say there's neat snacks in a place<br/>called the cap-ittel! I wonder what?")
('Ino', 'Mommy says she wants me to see a lot of the world.')
('Ino', "I've never gone anywhere but Longlai. I wonder what<br/>other towns are like?")
('Ino', "Mommy was talking to one of the people who's<br/>visiting for vacation, and she said how much she<br/>wants to show me places!")
('Ino', 'Hi there! Are you all visiting for a vacation?')
('Ino', "Some of you're dressed kinda funny. You're not like<br/>the other people who visit!")
('Ino', 'Hey, where did you come from? I wanna hear all<br/>about it!')
('Fumi', "Now, now, Ino. Don't pester the customers, okay?")
('Fumi', "Didn't Mikasa from the inn just make time to play<br/>with you? Come on, now.")
('Fumi', "I'll get you something to eat in just a little bit, okay?")
('Ino', 'I love hearing people who come to Longlai talk!')
('Ino', "They tell me about other towns, and they aren't<br/>like Longlai! I wanna go do a tourism too someday!")
('Kukai', "I heard about your missing child. Sadly, all I can say is<br/>that I don't know anything.")
('Kukai', "I can tell you that I've been watching the river this<br/>whole time. If she'd fallen in, I'd know.")
('Kukai', "Even the worst aside, the autumn river can give you<br/>a frightful chill. Still, I think we're safe from all that,<br/>at least.")
('Kukai', "I'll make sure to keep a close eye on the river for the<br/>time being.")
('Kukai', 'Come to think of it, the Revolution Festival is<br/>coming up next month, yes? The big one in<br/>the capital?')
('Kukai', "I've been to the interior of the Republic a number of<br/>times, but never quite had the time to make it to<br/>the festival.")
('Kukai', "I don't have any reason to rush back east, so perhaps<br/>it would make for a good change of pace to go see it<br/>this time.")
('Kukai', "It's been a while since I had such a pleasant time<br/>fishing in the day. I do hope I was able to convey to<br/>the young folk a bit of fishing lore.")
('Kukai', "I must say, the fish of Longlai grow as well as they've<br/>ever done. They're always a pleasure to catch.")
('Kukai', "There's a number of places out east where the fish are<br/>doing poorly, so I can't help but appreciate this land's<br/>richness every time I come.")
('Kukai', 'Of course, a fisherman who has mastered the true<br/>essence of fishing, such as myself, can catch fish even<br/>in the most beset of lands.')
('Kukai', "Ah, speaking of the time since I was last in the<br/>Republic proper, there's been this new trend, orbal<br/>films, yes?")
('Kukai', 'The advertisements make them look quite interesting.<br/>I should find a day to experience them and expand<br/>my horizons.')
('Kukai', '(Especially since I understand some of those movies<br/>have quite appealing women dancing and such.)')
('Kukai', 'Fishing, too, is an art one can master. To become one<br/>with the mountains, to read the flow of the rivers...')
('Kukai', "You there! Do you enjoy fishing? I am a master fisher<br/>from the East, and I've come to this land to share<br/>my knowledge.")
('Kukai', "Should you wish, I'd be happy to instruct you.<br/>Speak to me whenever you'd like lessons.")
('Kukai', '(Especially if you happen to have any sprightly young<br/>ladies needing instruction...)')
('Omoro', 'The mountains this morning are somehow... No, no.<br/>Best not to say anything.')
('Omoro', 'The air of this place flowed so well last night,<br/>yet now... I cannot help but worry.')
('Omoro', 'This night, as the calendar turns, will be the fifteenth<br/>night of the month... The moon heightens my power<br/>to see.')
('Omoro', 'Your thoughts—they are drawn to a certain location.')
('Omoro', 'From what I can tell, you have ties to Longlai...and<br/>those ties will tie a knot to a deeper tie yet.')
('Omoro', 'The will of the mountains in the air is strong today...<br/>Are you travelers?')
('Omoro', "Things are clear today... I could read your palms to<br/>see your fortune, if you'd like.")
('Nanai', 'Okay! I took a nice, warm bath, so time for another<br/>day of hard work!')
('Nanai', "I'm a bit spooked about this fog, though. I hope the<br/>tourists don't get lost.")
('Nanai', "Come to think of it, the Tourism Bureau was going<br/>on about a missing child, weren't they?")
('Nanai', "I'll keep an eye out while I warn the visitors<br/>around here.")
('Nanai', "How about ice cream for your dessert tonight?<br/>It's great after a bath!")
('Nanai', "Longlai's a quiet place, but I still wish there were<br/>more young people around.")
('Nanai', "It'd be a lot of fun to recommend all the hottest<br/>sweets made locally, y'know?")
('Nanai', 'Ah, the visitor from before. Lemme try and upsell<br/>you on this matcha ice cream again!')
('Nanai', "Western style, Eastern flavor! It's all the rage<br/>these days.")
('Nanai', "There's nothing wrong with real old-fashioned treats<br/>like mantou, but this ice cream has a real neat flavor.")
('Tsuruji', "The fog's just awful... I was going to go harvest some<br/>bamboo from near the waterfall, but in this<br/>cloudbank, maybe not.")
('Tsuruji', "The mountain roads get perilous when you can't<br/>see well. Plus I heard people were seeing strange<br/>monsters yesterday.")
('Tsuruji', "Don't worry, everyone. I'll help you all create some<br/>great memories here in town, so there's no need to<br/>go out.")
('Tsuruji', "Given the time, we won't be doing any more<br/>workshops, but I'm still selling souvenirs.")
('Tsuruji', "It's probably no surprise, but I opened this shop<br/>because I wanted to share the appeal of handicrafts<br/>with people.")
('Tsuruji', "There's a lot you can learn from the experience of<br/>actually making something and having the chance to<br/>touch and feel things.")
('Tsuruji', 'Hey there, sir. Want to try making some handicrafts?')
('Tsuruji', 'I sell a few completed products, too, but you can get<br/>the chance to touch and feel the materials for yourself<br/>and enjoy the sensation of it.')
('Tsuruji', 'You seem close to your partners, too, so how about a<br/>little suggestion?')
('Tsuruji', "There's a lot to be said for making something<br/>special together. Something that'll be a good memory!")
('Shigi', "Okay then! It's a little early, but I'll get the<br/>store open! Need to make sure the folks who leave<br/>during the day can stop by.")
('Shigi', 'Oh, yeah. I heard about a lost child... Gives me the<br/>willies, thinking of Ino in that situation.')
('Shigi', "Longlai's a very safe place, but it's surrounded by<br/>mountains and there's some real monsters not that far<br/>from town.")
('Shigi', "My daughter's at home now, but I'm still worried.<br/>Maybe I should try to keep a closer eye on her from<br/>now on.")
('Shigi', "Sadly, charcoal mantou aren't too good for dinner,<br/>I suppose. Night's when my wife rules folks' appetites.")
('Shigi', "Not that I'm complaining. After I close up, even I go<br/>out and grab some of the old folks to go<br/>drinking there. Helps contribute to sales!")
('Shigi', "And hey, the stuff at my wife's place is great with<br/>a drink. Perfect way to finish the day!")
('Shigi', "My wife's business is busy at night, so I take over<br/>watching our Ino at this hour.")
('Shigi', 'But being able to mind my little girl while I keep up<br/>with my old buddies is the best part of having us run<br/>our own shops!')
('Shigi', "Hey, you're that fellow who came by earlier!<br/>How about some charcoal mantou?")
('Shigi', 'Charcoal mantou and hot springs eggs might seem<br/>like more adult snacks, but their sweetness appeals<br/>to kids, too.')
('Shigi', 'My daughter Ino loves charcoal mantou. That girl<br/>needs her nibble to get through the day!')
('Shigi', "These mantou are great for an afternoon snack, unlike<br/>my wife's stuff on the other side of the creek!")
('Fumi', 'Well, then! Time to open the shop.')
('Fumi', "With this fog I'm not sure how many customers I'll<br/>even get, but still...")
('Fumi', "No point in whining about it. I'll just have to pull the<br/>customers in with my voice instead.")
('Fumi', 'Come to think about it, a girl about the same age<br/>came by very early this morning to buy a fantuan.')
('Fumi', 'It seemed odd, but... Oh, come to think of it, she<br/>came by yesterday, too.')
('Van', '(This is what Senri mentioned... She bought one and<br/>left immediately, then.)')
('Fumi', 'Good evening. How about some handy onigiri for a<br/>late-night snack?')
('Fumi', 'Tourists like to stop by for midnight snacks, so I stay<br/>open fairly late.')
('Fumi', 'My daughter likes to see the travelers, so at night we<br/>keep her with my husband or I.')
('Fumi', "We get to provide for our guests, and my daughter<br/>has fun, so it's pretty worthwhile to stay open<br/>this late.")
('Fumi', "Ah, you're from earlier! My husband's mantou is nice<br/>and all, but how about some of our onigiri?")
('Fumi', "You probably had lunch just now, but you should stop<br/>by tomorrow morning, if you'd rather! I sell some<br/>pretty rarefied onigiri.")
('Fumi', "In the East, onigiri is a common food for just<br/>about everyone. Wouldn't you like to get a feel for<br/>that yourselves?")
('Fumi', "Rice dumplings are said to be a common portable<br/>food for the mountain ascetics. Wouldn't you like to<br/>try that mountain taste yourself?")
('Fumi', "We've got more than onigiri, too. How about<br/>a fantuan? They're made with a very glutinous rice,<br/>different from the kind used in fried rice.")
('Fumi', "Since this is the kind of rice folks use to make candy,<br/>the kids love them. My daughter can't get enough.")
('Fumi', "It's also a great recommendation for kids who don't<br/>like eating veggies, since they're happy to eat rice<br/>dumplings even with fillings.")
('Filenkov', 'Next month will be the Revolution Festival, so I<br/>thought I should get home, but this morning I heard<br/>something from an acquaintance.')
('Filenkov', 'It seems they found some kind of rare something-or-<br/>others in the free cities, so of course, I need to<br/>rush over there now.')
('Filenkov', 'My acquaintance in Oración will introduce me to a<br/>guide, so it should work out.')
('Filenkov', "I'll just need to be sure I'm back in time for the<br/>festival, and it'll all be another story to share with<br/>the kids.")
('Filenkov', 'The souvenir shops here are quite something.<br/>They have such a wide selection of Eastern goods.')
('Filenkov', "I make sure to come by here every time I'm<br/>in Longlai. It's a good place to pick up tidbits of<br/>info on rare Eastern finds.")
('Filenkov', "I lucked into some especially good rumors this time.<br/>I'll need to hit up my acquaintance once I get back to<br/>the capital.")
('Filenkov', "Hmm? Ah, didn't we encounter each other<br/>at Langport? You're an acquaintance of Jigen, yes?")
('Filenkov', "This can't be a coincidence. Well, if you're excited by<br/>the antiques here, seek me out anytime.")
('Filenkov', 'I come by Longlai every year to identify rare<br/>Eastern finds.')
('Filenkov', "I couldn't get out further East this year, but I WAS<br/>able to pick up some odds and ends that were brought<br/>by train a few days back.")
('Filenkov', "Oh? I believe I saw you at some bar back in Langport,<br/>didn't I?")
('Filenkov', "A shame we didn't get a chance to talk then, but<br/>I'm a traveling antiques dealer.")
('Filenkov', "I only have a few things on me, but if you'd like, I<br/>could show you what I've got on hand.")
('Filenkov', "I couldn't get out to the East this year, but I was able<br/>to pick up some things from the people who pass<br/>through here.")
('Filenkov', "I would've liked to have gone further east, but my<br/>trip out to the Central East ended up taking longer<br/>than I'd planned.")
('Filenkov', "I'd really rather get back in time for the Revolution<br/>Festival, so sadly my grand journey east has to go on<br/>the backburner.")
('Filenkov', "Even so, there's plenty of exciting finds for me<br/>right here in Longlai.")
('Manager Mamiya', "I'm very sorry about your missing child... Our lodge<br/>takes full responsibility for this failure of security.")
('Manager Mamiya', "Far from providing you with a pleasant, relaxing time,<br/>we've caused you such worry. We are all so, so sorry.")
('Manager Mamiya', "I've taken the liberty of contacting the local police,<br/>the Tourism Bureau, and of course the Bracer Guild.")
('Manager Mamiya', 'I intend to continue searching myself as well, and<br/>pray to the Heavenly Mother that we find her safe<br/>and sound.')
('Manager Mamiya', 'Did you enjoy your meals and time in the hot springs?<br/>I hope you found what we offer fully satisfying.')
('Manager Mamiya', "We've had a number of visitors from much farther<br/>away lately—and I'm honored to say that our inn was<br/>quite popular with them, too.")
('Manager Mamiya', 'The lord of the hot springs town in the Empire came<br/>by, himself. He said he felt he could learn from us,<br/>which was a great honor.')
('Manager Mamiya', "I'm sure we'll have customers from all over staying at<br/>our inn. I hope we can provide for each and every<br/>one's satisfaction.")
('Manager Mamiya', 'Mr. Arkride, I hope you will enjoy your time both<br/>here at the Hekizanro Inn and in Longlai.')
('Manager Mamiya', 'We hope our hospitality will allow you to rest and<br/>relax while you enjoy the natural wonders of<br/>our town.')
('Manager Mamiya', 'Our inn does serve state guests and other VIPs on<br/>occasion, but we provide our best service to all<br/>customers, no matter their status.')
('Head Chef Hakurou', "I've just finished morning prep...but I hear a child's<br/>gone missing?")
('Head Chef Hakurou', "The inn is helping search, too, so I guess I'll ask our<br/>provisioners and other folk I know if they<br/>saw anything.")
('Head Chef Hakurou', "Aside from that, I'll hope and trust that she'll be<br/>found safely, and get something warm ready for<br/>her return.")
('Head Chef Hakurou', "I'm pleased you enjoyed our traditional<br/>multi-course dinner. That format is a specialty of<br/>Eastern cuisine!")
('Head Chef Hakurou', "Hospitality isn't just serving food made with<br/>fresh ingredients. It's also arranging the food to<br/>visually please, and serving it right.")
('Head Chef Hakurou', 'Several chefs have come here to train with us before.<br/>I hope they picked up on that mindset.')
('Head Chef Hakurou', 'In fact, one of my students is over in Langport.<br/>I hope they, especially, were able to take those lessons<br/>to heart.')
('Head Chef Hakurou', "I'm glad to hear you enjoy our local cuisine.<br/>Dinner tonight will be a traditional<br/>multi-course affair.")
('Head Chef Hakurou', "The key to these dishes is to use the best of Longlai's<br/>natural resources to fully bring the appeal of our<br/>seasonal best to life!")
('Head Chef Hakurou', 'I believe that the work done at the earliest stages in<br/>particular, like marinating in alcohol and such, is key<br/>to a good meal.')
('Head Chef Hakurou', "No matter how long it takes, if it allows me to offer<br/>the best dishes imaginable, that's where my honor<br/>comes from.")
('Head Chef Hakurou', 'Cooking, too, is a key piece of culture that carries<br/>within it Eastern ideas and thoughts.')
('Head Chef Hakurou', 'As someone entrusted with the position of master<br/>chef at a historic inn like this, I owe it to each and<br/>every customer to bring that to life.')
('Head Chef Hakurou', 'After all, there is no limit to how well you can provide<br/>hospitality—especially the Eastern sort!')
('Head Chef Hakurou', 'As the master chef, I believe I have a responsibility to<br/>constantly improve my own skills.')
('Hostess Mikasa', "I'm sure you're very worried about your child.<br/>We've contacted the Tourism Bureau and the police.")
('Hostess Mikasa', "Our inn's employees will of course be helping you<br/>search, and we'll also be ready to help safeguard her<br/>once she's returned.")
('Hostess Mikasa', "I'll go contact a few of my acquaintances as well.")
('Hostess Mikasa', 'I just do hope we find her...')
('Hostess Mikasa', 'Did you enjoy the hot springs of our inn?')
('Hostess Mikasa', "The Longlai hot springs have long been known for<br/>their restorative and beautifying effects. They're the<br/>blessing of the Tianshan Mountains!")
('Hostess Mikasa', "We also offer shiatsu and seitai massages, if<br/>you'd like. We are confident we can provide whatever<br/>you need to banish your exhaustion.")
('Hostess Mikasa', 'Please relax and enjoy yourself here, Mr. Arkride.')
('Hostess Mikasa', 'We will have your room cleaned while you are out.<br/>Should you have any questions or points of interest,<br/>please inform us.')
('Hostess Mikasa', 'We would love to hear your insights and thoughts so<br/>we can best help you enjoy your time here at Longlai.')
('Hostess Mikasa', 'If you are going out to tour, one popular spot to see<br/>would be Longlai Temple.')
('Hostess Mikasa', 'It is a lovely place where one can closely experience<br/>the culture, values, and history of the East, as well as<br/>experience Eastern art.')
('Hostess Mikasa', 'Also, you may enjoy the hands-on workshop and<br/>fortuneteller that are just down the way. Both are<br/>also popular.')
('Tousen', "The inn already informed the Tourism Bureau about<br/>your lost child. I've told our staff to contact you if<br/>they see her.")
('Tousen', "We'll check all the places we usually see lost<br/>children—the storehouses, the unopened shops,<br/>places like that.")
('Tousen', "I've got to open my shop myself, but I'll keep an eye<br/>out as far as I can from here. Just tell me if there's<br/>anything else I can do.")
('Tousen', "Oh, welcome! Though it's a bit late. I will be closing<br/>soon, but you caught me just in time.")
('Tousen', 'The Tourism Bureau is proud to offer help to anyone<br/>who needs it, even at this late hour.')
('Tousen', 'With that said, I do have some paperwork I need to<br/>handle, but visitors always come first. Feel free to ask<br/>if you need something.')
('Tousen', 'Welcome, visitors. Looking for good souvenirs of<br/>your trip to Longlai?')
('Tousen', "I'll be glad to help you with that. As it happens, I'm<br/>the chief of the Tourism Bureau as well.")
('Tousen', "I'm sure I can help you figure out what you'd like<br/>to get.")
('Tousen', "Longlai's unique selling point is how different it is<br/>from most other places influenced by Eastern culture.")
('Tousen', "I'm sure you'll find something here that is entirely<br/>unique—even compared to, say, Langport.")
('Tousen', "I'm happy as long as I can help you make a unique,<br/>special Longlai memory or two.")
('Sumi', 'I was just about to start morning prep, but the kid<br/>who was with you has gone missing?')
('Sumi', "My son seemed pretty worried, too... I'll be glad to<br/>offer any help I can.")
('Sumi', "After all, what is 'hospitality' if not helping visitors<br/>feel at peace?")
('Sumi', "Oh, hello. Welcome, late visitor. If you'd like, I'll be<br/>happy to whip up dinner for you.")
('Sumi', "Oh, yes—that's my son there. As you can see, he's a<br/>healthy eater, especially now that he's in his<br/>growth spurt.")
('Sumi', 'He likes to tell me how he can do his best as a guide<br/>thanks to my meals.')
('Sumi', "I can't help but feel a little embarrassed and happy at<br/>that at the same time. Both as a mother, and as<br/>a cook!")
('Sumi', "Welcome. Would you like to taste the flavor of<br/>Longlai and Eastern home cooking? You'll find it<br/>much different than the fancy shops!")
('Sumi', "I used to work with tea, so I've also got a good eye for<br/>food that matches tea well!")
('Sumi', "I'd be glad to introduce you to the flavors loved by the<br/>common folk of the East.")
('Sumi', "Oh, yes—if you see my son outside, he's working with<br/>the Tourism Bureau as a guide, so feel free to lean on<br/>him a bit.")
('Sumi', "He's such a smart kid. He's still young, but he'll do a<br/>fine job showing you to the sights of Longlai.")
('Novic', 'Now, should I grab a mantou, or one of those<br/>rice-based food items for a quick breakfast?')
('Novic', "Oh, wait! I'd better go get souvenirs for my<br/>co-workers soon...")
('Novic', "Can't buy anything that won't stay fresh... Wonder if<br/>they've got some dried goods? Or maybe even a<br/>knickknack or something?")
('Novic', 'Phew! What a great bath. My shoulders feel way<br/>lighter, and I feel so rejuvenated.')
('Novic', "I guess you'd expect that they'd feel as good as the<br/>Hekizanro Inn's baths, since they're from the<br/>same source.")
('Novic', "Best of all is letting the night air blow across me now<br/>that I'm all warmed up...")
('Novic', "This homestyle food's so nice! It's not super fancy or<br/>anything, but it still tastes fantastic.")
('Novic', "I really am interested in the Hekizanro Inn's big<br/>meals, but honestly? I could just eat here the<br/>whole trip and be happy.")
('Novic', 'Also...frankly, with how unique the cultural<br/>experience here is, I think staying in some nice, cheap<br/>lodging would still make for a great trip.')
('Lotta', "Well, I'd better figure out what to get my friends<br/>as souvenirs.")
('Lotta', "The real problem is, those treats I thought would be<br/>great won't stay fresh long enough!")
('Lotta', "And dried goods are a bit of a snooze. This is for my<br/>girl friends, so I want to get 'em something sweet!")
('Lotta', "My brother's going on and on about how nice his<br/>shoulders feel. For Aidios' sake, he's only twenty!<br/>Talk about old-man talk, right?")
('Lotta', 'Well, I mean, I do hope the hot springs have all the<br/>effects they claim to, myself.')
('Lotta', "It's supposed to have an exfoliating effect on<br/>the skin... Can't help but hope for that, right?")
('Lotta', 'My brother and I went to Langport before, actually.')
('Lotta', "I wasn't sure what to expect from Longlai.<br/>But honestly, the feel here is more than the gossip<br/>could make you hope for.")
('Lotta', "I'd heard there's a lot of different Eastern cultures,<br/>but, like...clearly there's even more to it than<br/>I thought!")
('Vicar Murase', "The temple's staff and I will help keep an eye out for<br/>your child.")
('Vicar Murase', 'The Tourism Bureau and the police are<br/>also searching. We will keep in touch with them.')
('Vicar Murase', 'I have faith that the Heavenly Mother will guide us.<br/>I encourage you not to lose hope.')
('Vicar Murase', '...There are no few people who come from the East<br/>bearing great burdens of the soul, seeking solace at<br/>our temple.')
('Vicar Murase', 'I do my best to be someone they can talk to, and a<br/>connection back to the East for them. I hope to be a<br/>source of strength.')
('Vicar Murase', 'For him... Even if he wishes to treasure his ties to the<br/>Republic, he should find a chance to go back.')
('Vicar Murase', 'For circumstances like this, we will happily help<br/>secure passage back east.')
('Vicar Murase', 'Welcome. Might you be tourists?')
('Vicar Murase', 'I think you will be shocked at how different both our<br/>Longlai Temple and all of Longlai are from other<br/>places such as Langport.')
('Vicar Murase', "The culture of Langport inherited more from the<br/>coast of the East, through its sea routes.<br/>Longlai's cultural heritage comes from the land.")
('Vicar Murase', "It is because of Longlai's history as a gateway for land<br/>routes connecting the many cultures of Zemuria.")
('Vicar Murase', "Longlai is known well as a 'tourist spot,' but is as<br/>much a gateway eastward now as it has ever been.")
('Vicar Murase', 'Well...I say that, but that side of Longlai diminishes<br/>as the years turn. Yet there are still travelers from the<br/>East who pass through.')
('Vicar Murase', 'I believe it is the mission of our temple to help these<br/>visitors from afar, and to help the people of this land<br/>understand the East.')
('Taihong', "So...I've been working in the Republic, sending<br/>money back to my village in the East.")
('Taihong', "The other day, I...I got a letter informing me my<br/>parents passed away. I couldn't be there for their<br/>funeral, even...")
('Taihong', "I don't have anything anymore. No one to send<br/>money to, no family waiting for me to come home...<br/>What is even left for me?!")
('Vicar Murase', 'Hmm... Please, look at me. I wish to hear more, but<br/>first, I must ask you a simple question.')
('Vicar Murase', "I want you to think hard, and answer me this: is the<br/>mira you've earned at work the only thing you've<br/>gained here in Calvard?")
('Vicar Murase', "If you believe you've connected to people here...<br/>I promise you, you have always been guided by the<br/>Heavenly Mother.")
('Taihong', 'I-I mean, yeah. I have friends here, I...even have<br/>someone I was thinking I might marry.')
('Taihong', 'But all of that means abandoning my home!')
('Vicar Murase', 'You have abandoned no home, child. I believe you<br/>should trust in the ties that connect you and move<br/>forward, instead.')
('Vicar Murase', 'It is those same ties that brought you here to our<br/>temple, I would say. I will be of whatever aid I can<br/>to you.')
('Vicar Murase', "Should you return home, I will be glad to help you,<br/>and I'll make arrangements with the temple at<br/>your destination.")
('Vicar Murase', 'What I want you to understand is that you are<br/>not alone.')
('Taihong', "Father... You're right, of course. Maybe I'm just being<br/>too pessimistic.")
('Taihong', "I still have people who will stand with me, and the<br/>guidance of the Heavenly Mother, so I shouldn't be<br/>like this.")
('Priest Izumi', 'I will continue to ask our worshippers about your<br/>lost child.')
('Priest Izumi', "If the worst has happened, we'll be ready to help<br/>however we can. We can provide a great deal of<br/>medical aid.")
('Priest Izumi', 'But we pray she is found safely, above all else.<br/>O Heavenly Mother... Please, show your wayward<br/>child your blessing...')
('Priest Izumi', 'Good evening. What brings you here at this<br/>late hour? If you need help, we will be happy to do<br/>what we can.')
('Priest Izumi', 'Father Murase often spares an ear for the worries of<br/>Eastern travelers like that young man.')
('Priest Izumi', "I was born here in Longlai, but I'd like to be even half<br/>the rock of stability Father Murase is for others.<br/>That's why I joined the temple.")
('Priest Izumi', "That's not to say I'm not also proud to help provide<br/>for tourists, of course. And to help people understand<br/>the culture of the East, too.")
('Priest Izumi', 'Welcome to Longlai Temple.')
('Priest Izumi', "We're proud to help acquaint visitors with the culture,<br/>styles, and hospitality of the East.")
('Priest Izumi', 'As it happens, we are preparing to hold an Eastern<br/>tea ceremony, if you wish to be present for it.')
('Taihong', "I don't know yet if I'll be staying here in the Republic<br/>or going back to try my best back east, even with my<br/>parents gone.")
('Taihong', "But either way, I have folks who I've forged<br/>friendships with here in the Republic.")
('Taihong', "Realizing that makes it a little easier to keep going,<br/>rather than just feeling like it's all hopeless.")
('Taihong', 'If I want to move on at all, though... I think I do need<br/>to go back home so I can at least say proper goodbyes<br/>to my parents.')
('Taihong', 'I guess I thought, until now anyway, that I was living<br/>in this foreign land so I could help my family.')
('Taihong', "But...it's fair for me to ask for help, too, isn't it?")
('Taihong', "Hah. Somehow I almost lost sight of all the people<br/>I've made friends with here, and even of the blessings<br/>of our Heavenly Mother.")
('Taihong', 'I guess I was just too desperate.')
('Taihong', "All the years I've spent earning and sending back<br/>home added up to nothing, huh...?")
('Taihong', "The other day I got a letter saying my parents back in<br/>my hometown passed away. I don't have anyone to<br/>send money to anymore.")
('Taihong', "So...what do I do now? Why work here in the<br/>Republic if there's no one left to benefit?")
('Taihong', "My hometown's had bad harvests for, I guess, almost<br/>a decade. There's nothing to eat other than food they<br/>buy from outside.")
('Taihong', "That's why I was sending mira. I was sending it so<br/>they could live, and now...")
('Receptionist Drusilla', "You might not be able to tell, but Kazan's got a<br/>real instinct for this sort of thing.")
('Receptionist Drusilla', "I'm confident we can cross out the waterfall.<br/>Which mostly just leaves searching the highway...")
('Receptionist Drusilla', "Arkride, I'm sure you understand the situation here<br/>in Longlai.")
('Receptionist Drusilla', 'So you leave this to us and go search.')
('Receptionist Drusilla', "Well, the newbie was found safe and sound, and on<br/>top of that we now understand there's a bit of a<br/>background there, so all's well that ends well.")
('Receptionist Drusilla', 'Now it comes down to how well we can help a junior<br/>bracer like him develop.')
('Receptionist Drusilla', "We'll just have to watch over him as he works<br/>things out.")
('Receptionist Drusilla', "Oh! Hello, Arkride. I'm sorry I didn't notice you.")
('Receptionist Drusilla', "As it happens, I had something on my mind...<br/>Anyway, it's a guild problem.")
('Receptionist Drusilla', "I'm sure Kazan will resolve things, so there's nothing<br/>you need to worry about.")
('Van', 'Oh, yeah?')
('Van', "(So she says, but now I'm kinda wonderin' what<br/>she meant...)")
('Receptionist Drusilla', 'Goodness, I thought I saw a familiar face. Good to<br/>see you, Arkride.')
('Receptionist Drusilla', "I don't suppose you've come back to retake your<br/>martial lessons, unofficial student of the<br/>Kunlun school?")
('Van', "Come on! I'm here as a tourist. Gimme an itty<br/>bitty break.")
('Van', "(This old lady used to be right up there with Master<br/>in pilin' up stuff for me to do.)")
('Van', "(The memories of this place are ones I'd<br/>rather forget...)")
('Agnès', "Ah, pardon? I think we're missing a little context, but<br/>you're acquainted with Van, yes?")
('Feri', 'Aha! Somebody Van knows! And wants to avoid,<br/>I bet.')
('Aaron', 'You know the local guild lady? I wonder...')
('Risette', "You are Mr. Arkride's acquaintance, then?")
('Quatre', 'Hmm? I sense some history here. You two know one<br/>another, then.')
('Van', "It's enough to say she's been the receptionist since<br/>way back when.")
('Van', "Don't be fooled by her bein' all placid looking.<br/>She's got strings to pull you can't even imagine.<br/>Stay frosty around her.")
('Receptionist Drusilla', "You're making me sound like a criminal boss.<br/>Besides, it's not been like that lately.")
('Receptionist Drusilla', "It's been a long time since we had any truly<br/>outstanding talents. Nowadays we're hard pressed to<br/>deal with problems here and out east.")
('Receptionist Drusilla', "There's plenty to reflect on in the Republic itself, but<br/>I can't spare the time or people for that.")
('Receptionist Drusilla', 'Of course, if you feel like helping out, Arkride, you<br/>and your assistants would be more than welcome.')
('Van', "Uhh, think I'll pass workin' on vacation time.")
('Van', "(In fact, it feels like she's already got a grip on my<br/>sitch here. A handful as always.)")
('Receptionist Drusilla', "There's plenty to reflect on in the Republic itself, but<br/>I can't spare the time or people for that.")
('Receptionist Drusilla', "Even near Longlai, things have gotten hard.<br/>Granted, I don't worry about things that won't affect<br/>the citizens.")
('Receptionist Drusilla', "I'll get in touch with Hazel and Zin again, I suppose.")
('Receptionist Drusilla', "Also, I really need to do performance reviews.<br/>Kazan's been, well, Kazan, and then there's Gray...")
('Agnès', "(Hmm... Even at a glance, it's impressive how well<br/>she handles things.)")
('Feri', '(This lady is amazing!)')
('Aaron', "(Damn. She goes hard... Actually, she's better at her<br/>job than even the Langport crew, I think.)")
('Risette', "(Goodness. She's so dedicated. I cannot help but<br/>be impressed.)")
('Quatre', "(She's incredibly capable. I suppose the guild would<br/>have its own old hands.)")
('Van', "(There's not really any big cases out here in<br/>Longlai, though.)")
('Van', "(With that said, it is the Doorway to the East.<br/>I'm sure it's rough work dealing with things here.<br/>She's good.)")
('Bracer Kazan', 'There were no signs of a kid near the waterfall.')
('Bracer Kazan', 'Considering our trip out to the mountains last night,<br/>I hope you trust my instincts on this, yeah?')
('Bracer Kazan', "Either way, I'm going out to check the<br/>eastern highway. Don't think she'll be out there,<br/>either, but...")
('Bracer Kazan', "I'll try to find a chance to go out to the area the<br/>rookie's covering, too, and help out.")
('Bracer Kazan', "All right, then. The kid wasn't by the waterfall, but<br/>there's no chance she'd go out to the eastern highway.<br/>Right?")
('Bracer Kazan', "Searching on foot from here to the border'll turn our<br/>legs to stumps.")
('Bracer Kazan', "Well, with my trained hunter's senses, it'll be easy<br/>enough to tell whether a child passed through.")
('Bracer Kazan', "Don't you worry too much, okay? You've got me and<br/>Drusilla, so it'll work out.")
('Bracer Kazan', "Being a bracer is all about teamwork. It's against our<br/>principles to go out alone without saying anything.")
('Bracer Kazan', "So I felt I had to be pretty strict, but I mean, I get<br/>it—everyone's got their own things to deal with.")
('Bracer Kazan', 'Anyway, time to go hit the baths and relax.')
('Bracer Kazan', "Ugh. What a mess. Wasn't expecting him to just<br/>disappear on me...")
('Bracer Kazan', 'Wonder if he went out to the waterfall?')
('Bracer Kazan', 'Oh, yeah! Job complete! Easy work for someone like<br/>me, of course.')
('Bracer Kazan', "After all, with my Matagi training, I'm<br/>perfectly accurate. I bet I just radiate that Real<br/>Man Aura.")
('Bracer Kazan', "Wait! Now's not the time. I don't need Drusilla<br/>getting on my case again.")
('Bracer Kazan', "The newbie's still not up to snuff.")
('Bracer Kazan', "Gotta get back and work him hard some more.<br/>All part of a day's work as his guild superior!")
('Bracer Kazan', 'Hey, you a tourist? You seem pretty capable.')
('Bracer Kazan', "Either way, stay off the highway, yeah? There's a<br/>nasty critter out there we haven't been able to<br/>exterminate yet.")
('Bracer Kazan', "Oh, man, next I'm gonna have to go deal with<br/>the waterfall... What a pain.")
('Bracer Gray', "I saw no signs of Yumé out on the west highway...<br/>We've got to find her soon!")
('Bracer Gray', "I'm so sorry for all the trouble I caused you by going<br/>out on my own last night.")
('Bracer Gray', "I hope, by way of apology, you'll accept me doing my<br/>absolute best in the search for Yumé—so I can<br/>improve as a bracer!")
('Bracer Gray', 'I saw no signs of Yumé out on the west highway...<br/>I hope we can find some sign of her soon.')
('Bracer Gray', "I've come out here for training, but if I can't do<br/>anything at a time like this, what good is all my work<br/>on myself?")
('Bracer Gray', 'I will do my absolute best in the search for Yumé, so I<br/>can improve as a bracer!')
('Bracer Gray', "I've got to become stronger as soon as possible...")
('Bracer Gray', "But that's no excuse to make trouble for the people<br/>around me.")
('Bracer Gray', "I'm so very sorry for everything. I'll ensure that<br/>nothing like this happens again.")
('Bracer Gray', "I didn't know what to think about Eastern culture at<br/>first, but it's so complex!")
('Bracer Gray', "It's like there's this effort to achieve harmony with<br/>nature, you know? And the town's quiet atmosphere<br/>feels like an Eastern aesthetic all by itself.")
('Bracer Gray', 'Hmm... The seniors at the guild said something<br/>similar, but there really is a lot to learn from<br/>encountering foreign cultures.')
('Bracer Gray', "I'll do the best that I can—for the sake of everyone<br/>who put so much effort in to help me!")
('Bracer Gray', 'Come to think of it, I heard this place has attracted<br/>warriors for a long time.')
('Bracer Gray', 'The harsh lands, the crisp air... I can see how it<br/>would, I guess.')
('Bracer Gray', 'Anyway! Gotta put my best foot forward and try to<br/>find a way to grow myself here!')
('Rocksmith', "I'll be in charge of coordinating our search with the<br/>police and the border guard.")
('Rocksmith', "Don't worry. I may be retired, but as you might guess,<br/>I've kept my contacts.")
('Rocksmith', "Still, though. Longlai isn't like other towns when it<br/>comes to getting lost. Be careful.")
('Warrant Officer Cody', "I'll also join the search once I've gotten in touch with<br/>everyone I can.")
('Warrant Officer Cody', 'Mr. Rocksmith seems concerned about the situation<br/>around Longlai.')
('Warrant Officer Cody', "Don't you dare let Mr. Rocksmith's goodwill go to<br/>waste, spriggan.")
('Agnès', "If she's somewhere in town, she must be hiding<br/>somewhere people wouldn't try to look, right?")
('Agnès', "But why, though? She's...definitely not the kind of<br/>girl who would hide on a whim for a prank. I'm<br/>really worried.")
('Agnès', 'Come to think of it, the inn was providing free tea.')
('Agnès', "Perhaps I'll bring some up to share with Judith.")
('Agnès', 'Mantou, onigiri, ice cream... There are so many<br/>lovely scents in the air!')
('Agnès', "I'd like to try them all, but lunch was quite fancy<br/>enough already.")
('Agnès', "If I eat a lot now, I'll probably regret it at dinner.")
('Van', "Finally givin' in to the sweet smell of sweetness, eh?")
('Van', "Eat as much as you want, I say. Don't let a diet stand<br/>between you and discoverin' new things.")
('Agnès', "True enough... I suppose you're right. I might not<br/>have another chance like this anytime soon.")
('Agnès', "The food is good, but I'm also excited for the<br/>activities in the area.")
('Agnès', "I'd love to get the chance to study and experience<br/>it all.")
('Agnès', "It's funny, but even just among mantou, there's so<br/>many flavors it's hard to decide.")
('Agnès', 'I wonder what flavor these black mantou are?')
('Feri', 'Hmm... If we were playing hide and seek, Yumé<br/>would be extra good at being sneaky...')
('Feri', "Not a lot of people saw her, though, so that means<br/>she can't have gone far, right?")
('Feri', "It's neat looking all over at souvenirs!")
('Feri', "I'm going to look for something cool to send to my<br/>family tomorrow!")
('Feri', 'I just had a rice dumpling!')
('Feri', 'I had some back at Langport, too, but the flavor and<br/>style of the ones here is super different.')
('Feri', "It's...weird, I think, that I know enough about<br/>Republic food now to talk like a fancy gour-mand!")
('Feri', 'This is all thanks to getting to hang out with<br/>you, Van.')
('Van', "True. Didn't quite mean to take you on the grand<br/>tour, but it did end up that way. Like with this trip.")
('Feri', 'For sure! With the Kruga, I would never travel just<br/>for a vacation. Anywhere I went was for work.')
('Feri', "So I'll travel and tour all over and go back to tell my<br/>family about stuff!")
('Feri', "Heehee! I'll need to get some souvenirs to send to<br/>my family.")
('Feri', 'The souvenir store is real big! I wanna see all the stuff<br/>they have!')
('Feri', 'Oh, Van!')
('Agnès', 'Hello. Feri and I were showing off our souvenirs to<br/>each other.')
('Van', "Oh, yeah? What'd you all pick up?")
('Feri', 'I got a picture postcard to send back home to<br/>my family!')
('Feri', "I'll send it along with some mantou and rice crackers!")
('Van', "Hey, bet they'll love that. Those snacks'll also keep on<br/>the road pretty good.")
('Agnès', 'As for myself, I purchased some assorted snacks for a<br/>few academy friends, like the ones in the<br/>Student Council.')
('Agnès', 'I also picked up a few things for myself. A cute<br/>candle, some tea...')
('Agnès', "It's only been a day, but it was still quite fulfilling.")
('Feri', 'For me, too! The hot springs and the meals were<br/>super cool!')
('Van', "Good to hear that.<br/>(Looks like they're getting a chance to relax.)")
('Aaron', "With how bad this fog is, a sighting from twenty<br/>minutes ago feels like it's worth piss.")
('Aaron', "Damn it... If we can't find her soon, we're gonna get<br/>chewed up and spit out by the old man when we<br/>get back.")
('Van', "Uh? Hey, I was wondering why I didn't see<br/>you earlier. The hell are you doing here this late?!")
('Aaron', "Aww, come on, old fart. Going blind? I'm doing what<br/>you do when you go traveling. Drinking, dealing,<br/>and buying.")
('Aaron', "Now, if this place had a proper pleasure district, we'd<br/>really be hopping, you know what I mean?")
('Van', "Keep it in your pants, punk. Don't indulge too much.")
('Van', "You cut too loose, you'll cause trouble for your folks<br/>back home.")
('Aaron', 'You think you need to tell me that?')
('Aaron', "If you want, you're welcome to join, yeah?<br/>Just another old man for the crowd.")
('Aaron', "Shame we're only gambling for liquor and snacks, but<br/>hey, it's a good enough table.")
('Aaron', "If you're feeling bored, you're welcome to join in.<br/>Course, I'll snag every mira you got if you try!")
('Aaron', 'Hey, good timing.')
('Van', 'Yeah...? Uhh... Wait. What the hell is that huge<br/>liquor jug?! Did you literally buy that first thing?')
('Aaron', 'Hell yeah, I did. Got to talking up the old man who<br/>runs the liquor store, and guess what? He sold me the<br/>bottle for half off! Man likes me.')
('Aaron', 'Was gonna settle in a bit. Just me, a drink, and<br/>scenery for flavor.')
('Aaron', "Wanna join me? Liquor in the day's a real treat.")
('Van', "Why am I not surprised? Anyway, 'preciate it, but<br/>I'll pass.")
('Van', "No way I'm boozin' up before I savor the sweets<br/>of Longlai. Wouldn't be able to enjoy the flavor like<br/>that, you know?")
('Aaron', "Sure, sure. That's what I figured, anyway.")
('Aaron', 'Oh, yeah. I saw some martial arts practitioners on our<br/>way here.')
('Aaron', "Dunno if they practice some local Longlai school or<br/>what, but I figured I'd go join them later.")
('Risette', 'I had the inn give me access to the security cameras<br/>that observe the area.')
('Risette', "I'm afraid that while I saw hints of Yumé on the<br/>camera, I was unable to find anything in the footage<br/>that would help us locate her.")
('Risette', "It is curious how she could evade cameras like that...<br/>Either way, I'm focusing on gleaning information<br/>from what we know.")
('Risette', 'I must admit, I found a surprisingly childlike joy in<br/>our touring today.')
('Risette', 'Naturally, working with your team at Arkride<br/>Solutions is very satisfying work, but still.')
('Risette', "I believe I shall remember today's events for a long<br/>time to come.")
('Van', 'Whoa... Talk about amazing autumn colors.')
('Risette', 'Hello, Mr. Arkride.')
('Risette', "I'd only seen photographs before, but it's amazing<br/>how lovely it can get, isn't it?")
('Risette', "Supposedly, this very moment, one week before the<br/>leaves begin to fall is when they're at their best.")
('Risette', "Perhaps I'll pick one to bring back with me as<br/>a souvenir.")
('Van', 'That sounds like you. A good idea, too.')
('Risette', 'Longlai is blessed with natural wonders in abundance.<br/>It is a deeply elegant, aesthetically pleasing city.')
('Risette', "I'll go view the river next, I think. I suspect the light<br/>reflecting off the clear water will be quite the sight.")
('Kimono Woman', 'Oh, my. What brings you back?')
('Kimono Woman', 'Could it be the evening breeze lured you back to<br/>spend some time with me?')
('Van', "Nah. I've got stuff to do, sorry.<br/>(Doesn't seem like she's trying to dig into me<br/>too much. Yet...)")
('Van', "(No telling when this fox is going to turn back into<br/>a beast. I'm better off just puttin' her out of<br/>my mind.)")
('Kimono Woman', 'No need to concern yourself, I assure you.')
('Kimono Woman', 'Enjoy the moment, here and now, with the moon and<br/>the evening breeze.')
('Quatre', "At the very least, learning she likely didn't head to the<br/>waterfall or highway was worthwhile.")
('Quatre', 'But that just returns us to our question of where she<br/>DID go...')
('Quatre', 'V-Van!')
('Van', "Hey there, rosy cheeks. Must've gotten nice and<br/>warm in the baths, eh?")
('Van', "If you want some advice, the best time to go in alone<br/>is the early morning. Gettin' in the first bath after it's<br/>been cleaned is great.")
('Van', 'If you get up early, think about it.')
('Quatre', 'Haha... How can I not trust the expert on baths?')
('Quatre', "And, well, these baths are pretty great. I'll take it<br/>under consideration.")
('Quatre', "For now, I'm plenty warm, so I'd like a drink.<br/>Do they have anything nonalcoholic?")
('Quatre', '(Well...now what? I guess the best time to try would<br/>be right after dinner, so...)')
('Van', "Hey, what're you up to? Especially lookin' like you're<br/>thinking so hard, you'll fold over.")
('Quatre', "Oh, no, I wasn't... Really, it was nothing.")
('Quatre', "I have to say, Judith is very...how to put this...<br/>She's considerate? Like...a bit of a softie?")
('Quatre', "I do feel bad for pushing Yumé off onto her, though,<br/>so I'll go check on them in a little bit.")
('Quatre', "It's almost unbelievable Judith's been at her, uh,<br/>hobby, for eight years now.")
('Quatre', "I guess you can't judge a book by her cover...")
('Quatre', '...')
('Van', '(...What?)')
('Quatre', "I'm not exactly sure why there's such a strong<br/>sulfurous scent here. Is it because we're close to the<br/>spring's source?")
('Quatre', "It's odd. I'm used to the scent from catching the smell<br/>of hydrogen sulfide from the labs, but it evokes a very<br/>different feeling here.")
('Quatre', "Strange for me to say, since I barely know Longlai.<br/>Maybe I'm just excited to be here.")
('Van', "Hey, it'd be a pretty crappy trip if you weren't excited<br/>to be goin' on it. You got a chance to relax, so take it.")
('Quatre', "Naturally. Goodness knows when I'll be here next.")
('Quatre', "I never thought much about going on a vacation, but<br/>so far it's proving more fun than I'd thought it'd be.")
('Quatre', 'I hope I can bring the professor, Essy, and Yang on a<br/>vacation sometime.')
('FIO', 'Long-range scan found no traces of Yumé.')
('FIO', 'No precedent for this failure exists. FIO suggests an<br/>update to related functionality may be required when<br/>the cause is determined.')
('FIO', "Unrelated notice... Mild humidity increase.<br/>Predicted possibility of an effect on<br/>tomorrow's weather.")
('FIO', 'Scent of cooked rice grains detected.')
('FIO', "Adding supplementary information based on<br/>Feri's input... Scent is defined as 'super<br/>mega delicious.'")
('Van', 'Wow... Guess this thing really is learning. In a couple<br/>different ways.')
('Van', "Hey there. What're you two doing here?")
('Risette', "I asked FIO to share today's visual recordings with<br/>me, actually.")
('Risette', "While I was dealing with that, I looked up and<br/>realized how lovely the stars were. Perhaps it's<br/>because Longlai has fewer lights.")
('FIO', 'FIO has also captured an image of this night sky.')
('FIO', 'It will be shared with Quatre later.')
('Van', 'Hah. Glad to hear you two are having a nice evening.')
('Van', "No kiddin', though. With tonight's skies, the stars are<br/>clear as gems.")
('Van', "Guess I'll take a moment to enjoy them, myself.")
('XEROS', 'GRR... WOOF.')
('Quatre', 'XEROS is also doing an analysis of record data to try<br/>to find traces of Yumé.')
('Quatre', "The most bizarre thing is we haven't turned up<br/>anything on any search mode. That would be<br/>unbelievable...under normal circumstances.")
('Van', 'I see.')
('XEROS', '...GRR.')
('Van', "Oh, hey! Napping here, buddy? Bet you'd give the<br/>other guests a real shock if they saw you.")
('XEROS', 'WOOF!')
('Judith', "She sure sleeps easy, huh? That's a sign of someone<br/>who'll be a big deal in the future, mark my words.")
('Judith', 'Also, you changed your clothes! You going outside?')
('Van', 'Ah, yeah. Got a little work, and also some<br/>side business. Keep an eye on Yumé for me,<br/>would you?')
('Judith', "Oh? Well, that's a little unfortunate, but I won't dig<br/>into it. Yet.")
('Judith', "Just be sure not to get back too late. You wouldn't<br/>want to worry your poor assistants.")
('Yumé', "Mmnn... I'm not shleepy... I wanna stay awake...")
('Yumé', "We're here to have fun...")
('Yumé', "Aww! I wanna go on your picnic, too! But okay, I'll<br/>be good and stay here!")
('Yumé', "If you find something fun, tell me about it, 'kay?")
('Yumé', "Wow! Longlai's houses are so different, it's all<br/>so neat!")
('Yumé', 'Are you having fun, too, Van?')
('Van', 'You bet. Never been here as a tourist before, after all.')
('Van', 'With our crew of lovable dinguses around, it feels<br/>extra special.')
('Yumé', "Yay! That's good. You've been so busy with work,<br/>after all!")
('Van', "Heh. Guess I've still gotta long way to go if I'm<br/>worryin' you, Yumes. Thanks.")
('Yumé', 'Hey! I wanna go find some things to give to mommy<br/>and grandpa when I get home!')
('Yumé', 'Will you help me find something later, Van?')
('Van', "Sure. I'd be glad to.")
(500, 'November 14th, 12:32PM')
('Yumé', "We're heeere!")
('Quatre', 'So this is Longlai...')
('Feri', "Wow! I've never seen anything like this.")
('Aaron', "It's got a whole different kinda Eastern vibe<br/>compared to Langport.")
('Risette', "It's like an idyllic town nestled in the mountains.")
('Agnès', 'That white smoke is steam from the springs,<br/>I assume? It certainly has a distinctive smell to it.')
('Van', "Yeah, that's the smell of sulfur. It's a big part of being<br/>near a spring.")
('Van', "Our lodgings are down to the right across the river.<br/>Let's go drop our stuff off before we do anything else.")
('Yumé', "There's so much stuff I've never seen before here!<br/>It's so awesome!")
('Feri', 'Everything smells so good, too!')
('Feri', "There's grilled skewers and mochi, and...what are<br/>those things with leaves wrapped around them?")
('Aaron', "Damn, starved much? Those're called zongzi.")
('Aaron', "...Actually, I'm starting to feel hungry, myself.")
('Quatre', 'Same here. I know we had a little bit to eat at that pit<br/>stop, but I could use a real meal.')
('Agnès', "Hmm... Lunch is going to be waiting for us at our<br/>lodgings, though, isn't it?")
('Risette', 'Yes. That should have some of the local cuisine, too.')
('Van', '(...No need to rush, I guess.)')
('Feri', 'Oh! What are THOSE?!')
('Yumé', "They're so hot! And they're super black, too!")
('Aaron', 'I dunno what they are, either. Maybe some kind<br/>of mantou?')
('Agnès', "They smell so sweet and fragrant—and Yumé's right<br/>about that color. That lustrous black really makes<br/>them stand out.")
('Shigi', "Heh. I see I've got your interest! These here are—")
('Van', '—hot spring mantou made using bamboo charcoal.')
('Van', "They've got black sesame jam inside and're as tasty as<br/>they look, but they fill you up fast. You won't have<br/>any room for lunch if you have one now.")
('Van', "How 'bout I buy some for everyone later?")
('Feri', 'Mmgh... They look so good...')
('Yumé', 'I guess we gotta wait if lunch is soon...but we have to<br/>come back here later!')
('Shigi', "Well! You certainly know your stuff, young man.<br/>I'll be waiting!")
('Nanai', "Longlai's known far and wide for its tea leaves, too!")
('Nanai', 'How about trying some of our confections made<br/>from them? Our matcha ice cream has been a hot<br/>seller lately!')
('Van', "Wait! MATCHA ice cream?! That's a thing now?")
('Van', "How do you make somethin' so bitter taste like...?<br/>Ugh. Now I gotta try it...")
('Feri', 'Can we?!')
('Agnès', '...What happened to lunch?')
('Quatre', "I've never seen someone lose all brain function when<br/>it comes to sweets the way he does.")
('Aaron', "And with saunas and cars, too. Dude's<br/>just insufferable.")
('Yumé', 'If we have to wait, you have to wait!')
('Risette', "We'll already be coming back here after lunch for the<br/>mantou, yes?")
('Yumé', 'Oooh!')
('Quatre', 'Th-This place looks so fancy...')
('Aaron', 'Yeah, this is pretty top class.')
('Risette', 'Indeed. It has a quiet elegance and beauty to it.')
('Feri', "I can't imagine how expensive it is to normally<br/>stay here... We're staying for free, right?")
('Agnès', 'I almost feel guilty about that now...')
(40303, 'Welcome. You must be Mr. Arkride and his party?')
('Van', "Yeah, that's right. Six adults and a child.")
(40304, 'We have been expecting you. Welcome to the<br/>Hekizanro Inn.')
(40304, 'We will be happy to carry your belongings to<br/>your rooms. You can have your lunch as soon as you<br/>wish after that.')
('Feri', 'R-Really?!')
('Aaron', 'Nice. Thanks, guys.')
('Van', 'Someone wasted no time making himself at home...')
('Agnès', 'Ahaha...')
('Feri', 'Whoa! This room is so nice!')
('Risette', 'Not so much as a spot of dust in sight, and the<br/>furnishings are rather extravagant as well.')
('Yumé', 'Can we share a bed, Agnès? Please?!')
('Yumé', 'Feri and Risette can sleep in our bed, too!')
('Agnès', "Heehee. The beds do look wide enough, so I don't<br/>see the harm in that.")
('Agnès', 'Maybe we could have a special samue party instead of<br/>a pajama party for the occasion, too?')
('Feri', "I don't know what that is, but I'm down!")
('Risette', 'Heehee. I would be happy to join in.')
('Quatre', "Uhh... So I'm with you two?")
('Van', "What'd you expect? You the kinda guy who can only<br/>sleep when he's by himself?")
('Quatre', "N-No, that's not it...<br/>(I should've seen this coming, honestly.)")
('Aaron', 'Aww. Did wittle Quattie wanna be with the girls?')
('Aaron', "Always gotta watch out for the quiet ones, 'cause<br/>there's a hungry wolf somewhere under there, huh?")
('Quatre', "D-Don't call me 'wittle Quattie' ever again! And I'm<br/>not a wolf!")
('Quatre', "*sigh* ...Whatever. I'm fine with this arrangement.")
('Van', "I'll try not to snore. Anyway, who's up for lunch?")
('Aaron', "Oh, man... I don't think my taste buds have EVER<br/>been this happy.")
('Feri', 'My mouth is bursting with flavor!')
('Risette', "It's called 'mitao menji.' It's a local dish here<br/>in Longlai.")
('Agnès', 'The chicken is soaked in peach alcohol before being<br/>stir-fried and served in a garlic and soy sauce.<br/>Whoever thought of this is a genius!')
('Van', "The chicken's so tender, and it's got that sweet peach<br/>quality to it you can't resist.")
('Van', "The flavor's distinctive enough while still<br/>being subtle. I'd call it a perfect blend of sweetness,<br/>fragrance, and juiciness.")
('Van', 'The chef here must be a real pro.')
('Yumé', 'The zongzi is sooo good!')
('Quatre', "Careful—it's also getting all over you.")
('Yumé', 'That was AMAZING!')
('Feri', 'Yeah. My mouth is in heaven right now!')
('Quatre', 'And it sounds like whatever they have in store for<br/>dinner tonight is going to be even better.')
('Risette', "It's going to be a traditional Eastern kaiseki meal<br/>served in courses.")
('Feri', "...'Kaiseki'?")
('Yumé', "What's that?")
('Van', "It's kinda one of those pretentious meals that're all<br/>about presentation—though in this case, I'm sure the<br/>Eastern cuisine's as good as it looks.")
('Aaron', "It's more of a Far Eastern thing than what I'm used to.")
('Aaron', "Something I've noticed, by the way, but how do you<br/>know so much about everything here, Van?")
('Van', 'Hmm?')
('Agnès', "I was wondering the same thing, actually. This isn't<br/>the first time you've showed us around somewhere...")
('Agnès', '...but it feels like you know this place far too well to<br/>have just come here for work.')
('Van', "Heh. I was hopin' you wouldn't pick up on that.")
('Van', 'I lived here a few years back.')
('Quatre', 'Really?')
('Feri', 'When was that?')
('Van', 'When I was nineteen, for about half a year.')
('Van', 'It was more for training than for fun, though.')
('Agnès', 'That explains it, then.')
('Agnès', '(I suppose that must have been a while after he<br/>separated from Elaine and Mr. Kincaid?)')
('Aaron', "So back when you were my age, huh? Hard to believe<br/>your memory's still sharp enough to remember what<br/>happened over a decade ago.")
('Van', 'It was only five years ago, damn it!')
('Van', '...But yeah, I should be able to play tour guide for you<br/>guys just fine.')
('Van', "Anyway, like I said earlier, we're gonna split up for<br/>two hours.")
('Van', 'Go ahead and sightsee, go for a stroll, grab something<br/>else to eat... The guidebook we got from the inn<br/>should help you around.')
('Van', "Try and avoid goin' around alone, though—especially<br/>you, Yumes. You always gotta be with someone.")
('Yumé', 'Aye, aye, sir!')
('Risette', "If there's anything you would like to see, I would be<br/>happy to accompany you.")
('Feri', "There's so much I want to check out, I don't know<br/>where to start... What did you have in mind, Agnès?")
('Agnès', "Hmm... I know I want to see the temple, but I'm not<br/>sure whether or not to go there first.")
('Aaron', "Drink, play, and buy is my gameplan! There's gotta<br/>be a spot for mahjong here, right?")
('Quatre', "Even if there is, it's not going to be in any<br/>tour guide...")
('Van', "(I guess I should help 'em around some before they<br/>get themselves in trouble.)")
('System', 'Select two additional members to accompany Van.<br/>They can be swapped out later using the computer in<br/>the room.')
('Agnès', "I wonder if word got out around the town that<br/>we're here.")
('Aaron', 'Or maybe one of the three people who sent us the<br/>tickets arranged for this?')
('Quatre', "Someone famous from Heiyue, Elsaim's crown<br/>prince, and Professor Hamilton, right?")
('Quatre', "At the very least, I can't imagine Professor Hamilton<br/>would do this without saying something.")
('Risette', "The other two don't seem like people who would take<br/>such a roundabout approach, either.")
('Yumé', "What're you talking about? Work?")
('Feri', 'Sorry for excluding you, Yumé. What does the<br/>note say?')
('Van', 'Sounds like one of the residents has got a problem<br/>they need help with.')
('Van', "They say it's not somethin' they can ask the guild or<br/>the police about, either.")
('Agnès', "Well, good thing we're here to help, then.")
('Van', 'They wanna meet under the maple tree in front of the<br/>Hekizanro Inn of all places, too.')
('Warrant Officer Cody', "...So they're the people he mentioned.")
('Warrant Officer Cody', "My sister's brought them up, too, but I'm not sure<br/>they're worth trusting.")
('Warrant Officer Cody', '...')
('Warrant Officer Cody', "Guess I'll sit back and see what they're about<br/>for now.")
('Warrant Officer Cody', 'And if they come up short, well—out the door<br/>they go.')
('Guide Senri', 'Oh! Hello there...')
('Yumé', 'Senri!')
('Guide Senri', "Man, you're just a bundle of energy, huh?")
('Guide Senri', "I can't tell since you've got her with you, but did you<br/>come because of my note?")
('Yumé', "Huh? You're so little!")
('Guide Senri', "Y-You're even littler than I am! Umm... I really didn't<br/>think you'd have a child with you...")
('Guide Senri', 'So did you come because of my note?')
('Van', 'This, right? Yeah.')
('Guide Senri', "What a relief! There was a rumor about you guys<br/>making the rounds yesterday, but I wasn't sure<br/>whether to believe it or not.")
('Guide Senri', "So you're the spriggan from the capital, right?")
('Van', "That's me... What's this about a rumor, though?")
('Guide Senri', 'I dunno where it came from, but I heard it through<br/>the tourism bureau, the guys at the station, and<br/>around the stalls.')
('Guide Senri', "Word was that some people who help with things the<br/>police and guild won't touch were going to be<br/>staying here.")
('Guide Senri', "I don't think anyone else actually believed it, though.")
('Aaron', "Can't say I blame them.")
('Feri', "I wonder where it originated from... It couldn't have<br/>come from the guild.")
('Agnès', 'So why did you believe it?')
('Guide Senri', "I don't know if I'd call it believing as much as I was<br/>just out of other options.")
('Guide Senri', 'Can I tell you more about what I want help<br/>with, then?')
('Van', "Sure. I can't promise we can help, but we're happy to<br/>hear you out.")
('Van', "So one of the visitors to the springs went to a<br/>waterfall that's meant to be closed off, huh?")
('Guide Senri', 'Yeah. She came to Longlai three days ago.')
('Guide Senri', "She asked if I knew anywhere that was good for<br/>'forgetting your worldly woes.'")
('Guide Senri', 'Without really thinking, I mentioned the<br/>Longlai Pubu.')
('Feri', "What does 'pubu' mean?")
('Aaron', "It means 'waterfall.' So 'Longlai Falls,' pretty much.")
('Aaron', 'That some kinda tourist destination, then?')
('Guide Senri', "Yeah. It's a real sight to see, too, with a huge white<br/>waterfall raining down from far above you.")
('Guide Senri', 'Plenty of people come here to see it, so there are<br/>usually tours around the spot.')
('Guide Senri', 'But four days ago, a big tree fell across the path to<br/>the falls.')
('Guide Senri', "We're getting someone to remove it right now, but<br/>until then, it's stuck there.")
('Quatre', "I see... Do you have any idea why she might've gone<br/>over to the falls anyway?")
('Guide Senri', "I really don't. I mentioned the tree and that there<br/>were monsters in the area, but she just shrugged it off.")
('Guide Senri', 'She just mumbled something to herself about them<br/>not being a big deal.')
('Guide Senri', "Usually bracers join the tours to keep people safe.<br/>You're not supposed to go on your own.")
('Guide Senri', "I tried to make it clear to her that she really shouldn't<br/>go near it, and she SAID she wouldn't, but...")
('Van', "But you think she was plannin' to the whole time and<br/>just wanted you off her case?")
('Guide Senri', 'Basically, yeah.')
('Guide Senri', "I haven't seen her anywhere around town today, even<br/>though she's supposed to still be here.")
('Risette', "Still, everything you've said so far makes this sound<br/>like the perfect job for us in particular.")
('Risette', 'Did you have any specific reason for not bringing it to<br/>the police or guild?')
('Guide Senri', "Well...see, she's staying at the Hekizanro Inn<br/>like you guys.")
('Guide Senri', "But it seems like she doesn't want anyone to know<br/>she's here—or even who she is.")
('Guide Senri', 'Still, I worked out her identity pretty fast, but then<br/>she asked me to keep it secret.')
('Guide Senri', "So because of that, I don't really want to make a big<br/>scene out of this. I think asking them would do<br/>the opposite.")
('Feri', '...Hmm?')
('Agnès', 'Th-This all sounds strangely familiar...')
('Quatre', 'Yeah...')
('Van', "Heh. Now that's a funny coincidence.")
('Van', 'Okay, got it. So you just want us to go find her and<br/>bring her back, right?')
('Van', "You got enough to pay us, by the way? The guild<br/>might work for free sometimes, but we don't.")
('Guide Senri', 'O-Of course! She gave me a good amount when I<br/>showed her around on her first day here, so I can<br/>definitely pay you.')
('Guide Senri', 'Erm... You charge a thousand mira an hour, right?')
('Van', '...How did even our hourly rate get out? But yeah—<br/>that and any necessary expenses.')
('Van', "That said, this job's about bringing someone home<br/>safe, so assumin' she's still alive, you could always ask<br/>her to pony up.")
('Aaron', "It might not be who we think it is, but we'll soon find<br/>out either way.")
('Guide Senri', "I'm so glad you're willing to help! The exit that leads<br/>to the falls is over there.")
('Guide Senri', "Just follow the path and you'll eventually get there.<br/>I can't see you getting lost, but do you want me to<br/>come with you just in case?")
('Feri', "Nah, I'm sure we'll be fine. Stay here where it's safe.")
('Feri', 'That goes for Yumé, too, of course.')
('Yumé', 'Huh? Are you going somewhere?')
('Van', 'Just on a dangerous picnic. Stay here with him, okay?')
('Van', 'And I think someone else should stay here so you can<br/>contact us if anything happens.')
('Risette', 'Perhaps myself, Ms. Claudel, or Mr. Salision would<br/>be an appropriate choice, then.')
('Risette', "We can work on gathering information from the<br/>orbal network while we're here.")
('Agnès', "That's true. We could also see if the police and guild<br/>know anything that could help us.")
('Quatre', 'That all sounds good to me.')
('Quatre', "I've got FIO and XEROS, too, though, so I think I<br/>could be a big help in the search if need be.")
('Feri', "Then we should head out as soon as we're ready!")
('Yumé', 'Right!')
('Aaron', "You're staying here!")
('System', "All of Arkride Solutions' members assembled<br/>once more.")
('System', 'Choose either Agnès, Risette, or Quatre to leave<br/>behind in Longlai before stepping out onto the<br/>mountain path.')
('System', 'Choose who to leave behind in Longlai.')
('Yumé', "Oh! You're back!")
('Agnès', 'Welcome back, everyone.')
('Agnès', "...Is it just me, or did Judith's face look a bit red?")
('Risette', 'Welcome back, everyone.')
('Risette', "I suspect something unexpected happened, but I'm<br/>glad to see you well all the same.")
('Quatre', 'Welcome back, everyone. So it really was the Judith<br/>Lanster, huh?')
('Quatre', "I've never seen her in person, but...is it just me, or<br/>did she look kind of mad? Or maybe embarrassed?")
('Agnès', "*sigh* It's a long story.")
('Risette', "It's rather a long story...")
('Quatre', 'The long and short of it is, Van ended up seeing—')
('Risette', 'To put it simply, Mr. Arkride ended up seeing Ms.<br/>Lanster—')
('Van', 'Can we please drop this and move on?!')
('Feri', 'Ahaha...')
('Yumé', '...Hmm?')
('Aaron', "Aww, come on. Don't be mad just 'cause she put the<br/>smackdown on you.")
('Guide Senri', "I'm just glad you were able to bring her back safe<br/>and sound.")
('Guide Senri', "I didn't realize you knew her personally, though.")
('Guide Senri', 'I guess there was no reason for me to keep her<br/>identity a secret after all, huh?')
('Van', "Sure, but you still did the right thing. When you're<br/>dealin' with customers, trust is everything.")
('Van', "She footed the bill, by the way. You don't need to pay<br/>us a single mira.")
('Guide Senri', "Oh, thank you! I'll be going, then.")
('Guide Senri', "If you ever need anything else while you're in town,<br/>just let me know!")
('Yumé', "Bye, Senri! Let's play together again sometime!")
('Guide Senri', "Haha. I'd like that, too!")
('Agnès', 'I see the two of them became fast friends.')
('Risette', 'I see the two of them became fast friends.')
('Agnès', 'They did. He taught her a lot of songs and games<br/>that are popular here in Longlai.')
('Risette', 'They did. He taught her a lot of songs and games<br/>that are popular here in Longlai.')
('Quatre', 'They did. He taught her a lot of songs and games<br/>that are popular here in Longlai.')
('Van', 'Glad to hear it. Man, though, is it ever getting late.')
('Van', "I dunno about you guys, but I'm feelin' kinda bushed.<br/>Think we could head back to the inn and rest?")
('Yumé', 'But I still wanna plaaay!')
('Feri', 'There are lots of fun things to do at the inn, too,<br/>you know.')
('Agnès', 'It has a big outdoor spring you might like!')
('Risette', 'What a nice idea it would be for us all to go in for a<br/>soak before dinner.')
('Yumé', 'Hmm... Okay!')
('Yumé', 'You guys DO look tired, so let Yumé give you<br/>some TLC!')
('Van', 'Heh. Thanks, kiddo.')
('Quatre', "I'm surprised she's heard that expression before.")
('Aaron', "Guess that stubborn old man's rubbing off on her.")
('System', 'The group made their way back to the inn, where<br/>they relaxed in their rooms and indulged in its<br/>facilities to unwind.')
('System', "They also took the time to report the cryptid-like<br/>beast's defeat to the guild while also letting Nina and<br/>Bermotti know that Judith had been found.")
('System', 'Dinner was reserved for 6:30PM.')
('System', 'Before that, however, they decided to do a little<br/>something else to make the most of their trip<br/>to Longlai...')
('Aaron', 'Ahh... Heehee.')
('Van', 'Enough with the seduction act.')
('Aaron', "Heh. I can't let my act get rusty while I'm not on<br/>stage, y'know?")
('Aaron', "But damn, if this water doesn't feel good.<br/>There's springs over in Langport, but this is<br/>next level.")
('Aaron', 'What, is the kid not coming in? Feels like a waste to<br/>come all this way and not use the outdoor spring.')
('Van', 'Yeah... I did invite him, but he said he was too tired<br/>and was just gonna settle with a shower.')
('Aaron', "Weird. Didn't seem like he was afraid of showing<br/>off that skinny-ass body or whatever.")
('Van', "There's plenty of cultures out there that don't do<br/>public bathing. Could just be that.")
('Van', "But you're right that it's a waste not to come in.<br/>I'll see if he wants me to reserve the place for<br/>him later.")
('Aaron', "Like some overprotective parent... Well, that kiddo<br/>might not be here to give you some 'TLC,' but I am.")
('Aaron', 'How about it? This do it for you? Old farts like you<br/>love these kinds of poses, right?')
('Van', "Oh, knock it off! Just 'cause you were born with looks<br/>and talent doesn't make it okay to abuse 'em.")
('Aaron', 'Hahaha! ...Made you hard?')
('Van', "I'm limp as a damn noodle!")
('Feri', '...? What are they even talking about over there?')
('Agnès', 'Ahaha... Wh-Who knows...?')
('Agnès', "(I can't believe those two—though I'm sure it was<br/>Aaron who was the one who started it.)")
('Yumé', 'Your hair is so smooth, Risette! Can I wash it<br/>for you?')
('Risette', 'I would be delighted if you did.')
('Agnès', 'Heehee. Yumé really does have a way of becoming<br/>fast friends with anyone.')
('Feri', 'I think of her as my little sister at this point.<br/>She reminds me of my younger siblings back home.')
('Agnès', "I almost forgot you're an older sister. It doesn't feel<br/>quite right to me somehow.")
('Feri', "Ahaha... Maybe for you, but for me, Kasim doesn't<br/>come home very often.")
('Feri', 'So I actually feel way more like an older sister than a<br/>younger one.')
('Agnès', "I-I see...<br/>(You'll probably always be the latter to me, sorry.)")
('Feri', "...Mm, you're definitely the older sister type, though.")
('Feri', "Your hair's so long, and your skin's smooth<br/>like porcelain. You're so...curvy, too.")
('Agnès', "Ahaha... Well, I like the way your hair is fluffy like<br/>kitten's fur.")
('Agnès', "And your skin's so lustrous with such a<br/>beautiful tone... Heehee. It's silky to the touch—I<br/>love it.")
('Feri', "Y-You really think so? I'm covered in scars, though...")
('Agnès', "Maybe so, but you got those protecting people like us<br/>and loved ones back home, didn't you?")
('Agnès', "I really don't want you to get hurt, of course.")
('Agnès', "But I see those scars more as proof of the sacrifices<br/>you've made for others, and so they make me all the<br/>more proud of you.")
('Feri', 'Aww, thank you... Heehee.')
('Feri', 'By the way, this might be out of nowhere, but...')
('Feri', "...what kind of person do you think Van's 'type' is?")
('Agnès', 'Pardon?')
('Feri', 'A long time ago, I remember asking Aida how people<br/>usually behave when staying over somewhere...')
('Feri', '...and she said they usually talk about romance and<br/>stuff—like who the people close to them might be in<br/>love with.')
('Agnès', "Ahaha...<br/>(Aida really didn't beat around the bush, huh?)")
('Agnès', "Hmm... I'm sure potential partners for him would<br/>need to be over a certain age.")
('Agnès', 'So not us. He sees us more as children.')
('Feri', "Heehee. He's so nice, though, isn't he?")
('Feri', "He makes it look like he's not paying that much<br/>attention to us, but it feels like he always is.")
('Agnès', 'Yes, I would have to agree.')
('Agnès', "But for an example...he isn't the same with us as he is<br/>with Risette and Judith.")
('Agnès', "Elaine, too... It's always like he acts with a lot less<br/>restraint towards them.")
('Feri', 'Now that you mention it...')
('Aaron', "But man, I've seen them all in the sauna before, but<br/>you sure got hella scars, huh?")
('Aaron', 'Bet they come with a ton of shady stories to tell.')
('Van', "Not gonna deny it. That's just how it is when you're<br/>in this business.")
('Aaron', "I'll bet. Especially when you've got connections with<br/>PMCs, the society, Heiyue, and a bunch of other<br/>dicey groups.")
('Aaron', 'Sounds like you backed up the Mirage side during the<br/>war a couple years ago, too.')
('Aaron', "Then your ex is an A-rank bracer, and you've got a<br/>partner in crime in the CID. A 'ton' might even be<br/>selling it short.")
('Van', 'Keep it up with the wild guesses.<br/>(Too sharp for his own good.)')
('Aaron', 'So you went to high school with those two, right?')
('Van', "...Gimme a break here. Your intuition is somethin'<br/>else, you brat.")
('Aaron', "Doesn't need to be 'something else' in this case.<br/>The small fry might not've noticed, but Miss Perfect<br/>sure has.")
('Aaron', "You're just so easy to read. It's like you're not even<br/>trying to hide this stuff.")
('Van', "Cuttin' right to the chase, huh? I mean, you're<br/>right—it's not like I'm goin' outta my way to hide<br/>it, but...")
('Aaron', 'You just never volunteer it, either. Same difference.')
('Aaron', "Almost bizarre how you hold your cards close to your<br/>chest while using your whole spriggan deal to meddle<br/>in others' affairs.")
('Aaron', "How you always dive headfirst to protect us from<br/>danger, whatever the cost to yourself—like you aren't<br/>worth a damn.")
('Van', "Puttin' it like that's a little...")
('Aaron', 'You try to disguise it. You get real pushy when it<br/>comes to mira and make a show of boiling everything<br/>down to debts paid or owed.')
('Aaron', "But it's all talk, isn't it? At least when it comes to us,<br/>you're all give and no take.")
('Aaron', "And I hate how you're making me leave my debt to<br/>you forever unpaid.")
('Aaron', "I get it, though. You're scared, aren't you?")
('Van', '...Heh.')
('Aaron', 'We all owe you in some way or another.')
('Aaron', "It's part of why I came all the way over to the capital<br/>to help out.")
('Aaron', 'Not a big part, though. Half for sightseeing, half for<br/>revenge, and, like, one percent repaying you.')
('Van', 'Oh, no doubt.')
('Aaron', "But that's not true for the others.")
('Aaron', "They're here because they're grateful to you.")
('Aaron', "Well, they're grateful and they worry about leaving<br/>you alone 'cause you're a danger to yourself.")
('Van', '...!')
('Aaron', "We're closer than you think, and not just in age.<br/>Maybe think about how liked you actually are next<br/>time you wanna pull the sacrificial lone wolf act.")
('Aaron', 'Not that I care what happens to you, just to be clear.')
('Van', 'Haha...')
('Aaron', 'Oh, get outta here with that shit!')
('Van', "Haha... Couldn't help myself. Not often you're<br/>this sincere.")
('Van', "Though if I've got a little hellion like you worried<br/>about me, then I got a long ways to go as a man.")
('Van', 'Just have to take it one day at a time.')
('Aaron', "Heh. Careful you don't overdo it, grandpa.")
('Aaron', 'Anyway, enough serious talk!')
('Aaron', "We're in a hot springs resort! You gotta tell me all the<br/>good night spots.")
('Aaron', 'Like where you can get down and dirty in the bath<br/>with some hot older girls.')
('Van', "Nowhere, that's where!")
('Feri', "'Get down and dirty'...?")
('Agnès', "A-Ahaha... Goodness, I wonder what that<br/>could mean?<br/>(He really can't help himself, can he?)")
('Yumé', "Whoa! Everything's all white!")
('Agnès', '...Sorry for leaving her with you all this time, Risette.')
('Risette', "Not at all. We've had a lovely time together.")
('Yumé', "Heehee. Leave the washing to me whenever<br/>you're ready!")
('Yumé', 'I want to help wash the boys, too. Can I?')
('Feri', "I...suppose it might be fine if it's just you?")
('Agnès', "Heehee. We'll have to get their and the owner's<br/>okay later.")
('Yumé', 'Ahaha! Splaaash!')
('Risette', '...Hmm? Is something wrong?')
('Agnès', "N-Not at all! I'm sorry.")
('Feri', "We just couldn't help looking at you.")
('Risette', 'Hmm? Oh, were you concerned with how my<br/>artificial body is faring?')
('Agnès', "Oh, it's not that...")
('Feri', "Umm... If anything, it's the opposite. I forgot<br/>it's artificial.")
('Risette', "Heehee. That's quite the compliment.")
('Risette', "I'm not going out of my way to hide anything, so you<br/>can look all you like if the sight doesn't displease you.")
('Feri', 'You have to squint to notice anything different<br/>at all...')
('Agnès', 'Oh, I see it now.')
('Risette', 'This is the joint between two of my artificial parts.')
('Risette', 'All it takes is to wear something over it, and nary<br/>a person is likely to notice.')
('Risette', "Still, while I may sound like an expert, I've only had<br/>this body for a year.")
('Agnès', 'I...see.')
('Feri', 'Umm...')
('Risette', "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to sound like I was holding<br/>knowledge over you.")
('Risette', "It's a rather complex story, and much of it<br/>is confidential. I wish I could tell you, if I'm<br/>being truthful.")
('Agnès', "No! You don't need to apologize!")
('Agnès', "You've gone out of your way to do what you can for<br/>us in spite of your limitations. If anything, you've<br/>been doing more than you should.")
('Agnès', "It makes me, umm... Well, I can't help but compare<br/>myself to you and feel a little inadequate.")
('Feri', '...You, Agnès?')
('Risette', 'Heehee. You see, I have numerous skills and<br/>knowledge because I was intended to be that way.')
('Risette', 'My skills have been refined—and my body<br/>modified—to best serve my purpose.')
('Risette', 'However, the both of you also have roles that only<br/>you can fulfill.')
('Risette', 'Roles that I suspect are much more important to<br/>Arkride Solutions than my own.')
('Agnès', 'You really think so...?')
('Feri', "I don't know... That's kind of hard to imagine.")
('Risette', "Don't worry about it too much for now—just try to<br/>take it to heart as wisdom from your elders.")
('Risette', "To add, while my body might differ from that of an<br/>ordinary human's, I am still twenty years old as I once<br/>told you all.")
('Risette', "I'm not an enchantress who is much older than she<br/>appears or anything to that effect.")
('Feri', 'Ahaha... Understood.')
('Agnès', "Heehee. Good to know, Risette.<br/>(We're so close in age, and yet she's so much wiser<br/>than me...)")
('Yumé', "What's an enchantress?")
('Feri', 'Oh! Yumé!')
('Yumé', "Are you all talking about work? I wanna help you<br/>all when I'm big, too!")
('Yumé', "Grandpa said I couldn't, but I'm not gonna listen<br/>to him!")
('Risette', "I'm sure hearing that would make him a bit sad...")
('Agnès', "I know I'd be happy to have you on the team, though.")
('Feri', 'Oh, for sure!')
('Aaron', "Sure is noisy over there. But I guess that's what<br/>happens when three quarters of the group're kids.")
('Van', "They're just in what I call the hot springs<br/>vacation spirit. Think it's probably time we got<br/>out anyways.")
('Quatre', '*sigh* Getting in the bath with everyone does seem<br/>like it would help me get to know them all better...')
('Quatre', 'But...')
('Quatre', "(I doubt they'd work out the truth that easily, but I<br/>couldn't be as comfortable as I can with Gran and the<br/>others back home...)")
('Quatre', "(Still, it would be a waste just to have a shower,<br/>so maybe I'll sneak in later once everyone's done.)")
(500, 'November 14th, 6:30PM')
('Yumé', 'Is this where we get to eat?')
('Aaron', '*whistle* Now this is fancy.')
('Feri', "It's so grown up...")
('Agnès', 'It really is a lovely room. Oh, but...')
('Van', "There's other customers here, so we probably<br/>shouldn't be eatin' here when we've got a kid with us.")
('Van', 'Maybe we should eat in the lounge where we had<br/>lunch instead?')
('Yumé', 'Hmm?')
(40301, "There's no need for concern. This room has been<br/>well soundproofed.")
(40301, "She isn't going to be a bother to anyone.")
('Agnès', "Well, if you're sure...")
('Risette', 'In that case, I think it would be rude to turn<br/>them down.')
('Quatre', 'All the other customers do seem to have their own<br/>rooms—')
(40302, "We've prepared the same room you used last night.")
('Judith', "Thanks! Yesterday's food was really good, so I can't<br/>wait for... Oh.")
('Van', 'Oh...')
('Yumé', "It's the lady from earlier!")
('Agnès', 'G-Good evening, Judith...')
('Aaron', 'Almost forgot you were staying in the same place<br/>as us.')
('Judith', 'O-Oh, right. You did say that you were here for a few<br/>days on vacation...')
('Judith', "W-Well, I'll just be going, then—<br/>WAIT! I need food!")
('Judith', "Ahem. I'm really sorry to ask, but could I have my<br/>meal in my room?")
('Judith', "I'd be happy to pay you extra for the trouble.")
(40302, "O-Oh... If that's what you would prefer, then we'd be<br/>happy to accommodate you. There's no need to pay<br/>extra, however.")
(40302, "We'll see to getting your room ready—")
('Yumé', "Are you one of Van's friends, too?")
('Judith', '...Huh?')
('Agnès', 'What are you doing, Yumé?')
('Quatre', 'When did you get there?')
('Yumé', "What's your name? You're so pretty!")
('Yumé', "I'm Yumé! I'm going to be a cute waitress at<br/>Montmart one day!")
('Judith', "R-Really? Isn't that something?<br/>(A liiittle help here?)")
('Van', "Erm... Yumes, she's not—")
('Yumé', 'Hmm?')
('Judith', 'Erk...')
('Judith', "M-My name's Judith. I-It's nice to meet you, Yumé.")
('Yumé', 'You, too!')
('Yumé', 'Come have your dinner with us! Eating by yourself is<br/>so lonely.')
('Yumé', "It'll be way more fun together!")
('Judith', 'Uh, hold on!')
(40302, 'Umm...')
(40301, 'Umm... What would you like to do?')
('Van', "Well, we DO know her—so I guess it's up to our<br/>friend over there.")
('Van', "The menu changes daily here, so we'd both be getting<br/>the same options regardless, right?")
(40301, "Yes, that's correct.")
(40302, 'We can accommodate either decision. Just let us<br/>know what you would prefer.')
('Judith', 'L-Listen, Yumé...')
('Yumé', "...You aren't gonna come join us?")
('Judith', 'Erk...')
('Quatre', '(...And Yumé wins this round.)')
('Aaron', "(Didn't stand a chance.)")
('Risette', "(I don't think any of us would.)")
('Judith', 'Augh! Fine!')
('Judith', 'Bring my food in here, please! I accept my fate!')
('Yumé', 'Yaaay!')
('Feri', "Heehee. We're happy for you, Yumé.")
('Agnès', "Ahaha... I hope this isn't too much trouble.")
(40301, 'Not at all.')
(40302, "We'll get everything ready at once.")
('Yumé', '*munch* This tastes so goooood!')
('Quatre', "Careful, or you're going to get it all over you again.")
('Quatre', "I never would've thought you were the infamous<br/>Grimcat causing trouble in the capital.")
('Quatre', "Even after seeing you in that outfit, I'm still having a<br/>hard time believing it.")
('Quatre', "I wasn't there to see you in that outfit, so I'm still<br/>having a hard time believing it.")
('Feri', "Ahaha. I don't blame you.")
('Van', "Like I said, though, your secret's safe with us.<br/>Don't stress.")
('Agnès', 'Thank you again for saving us back at Al-Jumeirah,<br/>by the way.')
('Judith', "D-Don't mention it. You were only there because of<br/>a job from me and Nina. It was the least I could do.")
('Judith', "I think I can trust that you won't tell anyone, though.<br/>Especially since you seem to have your own stuff you<br/>want to keep quiet.")
('Judith', "Still, if it gets out, it gets out. I'm even prepared to<br/>abandon my career as an actress if that happens.")
('Feri', 'Y-You are?')
('Aaron', "Heh. I guess if you didn't have that much resolve, you<br/>wouldn't target bigwig politicians and the like in the<br/>first place.")
('Risette', 'How many other people know your identity other<br/>than us?')
('Judith', "A handful, but they're all people who have different<br/>sides of their own.")
('Judith', "I've somehow managed to keep the whole film<br/>industry in the dark, though.")
('Judith', "...Seriously, please don't tell anyone. I'll even pay you<br/>hush money if I have to.")
('Van', "Nah, your hush money's no good here. Happy to pick<br/>up more work from you, though.")
('Van', "But y'know, it's been eight years now since all the<br/>phantom thief hubbub started...")
('Van', "So what, you've been living a double life like this<br/>since you were a kid?")
('Judith', 'Yeah. I started out both as a thief and an actress at<br/>the same time, when I was fourteen.')
('Judith', "I can't say it's been easy, but I had rivals in both fields<br/>who spurred me on.")
('Judith', 'Mom and Grammy were against my decision, but<br/>back when they had the mantle—')
('Aaron', "You just can't stop putting your foot in your mouth,<br/>can you?")
('Agnès', "Ahaha... I can't help but be curious about your family<br/>and rivals, though.")
('Risette', "It's impolite to pry too much, however.")
('Quatre', "Still, hearing that reminds me of some things I've<br/>read in the past.")
('Van', "So you're not the first Grimcat, then? There were a<br/>couple more before you?")
('Judith', 'So much for not prying! I REALLY hope I can trust<br/>you guys on the secret thing!')
('Van', 'You can, you can. We got you.')
('Van', "It was the Grimcat in you that put you on Maxim's<br/>trail, then?")
('Judith', 'Yeah. I suspected he had something to do<br/>with Almata.')
('Agnès', '...What?')
('Feri', 'How come?')
('Judith', "It's not just politics and entertainment that they have<br/>influence in, but sports, too.")
('Judith', "There's all kinds of shady rumors floating around<br/>about them even now, from them supplying illegal<br/>donations to stories of human trafficking.")
('Judith', 'Then I started hearing stories of Maxim traveling<br/>around from place to place.')
('Judith', 'It made me start to wonder if that was because he was<br/>doing something on behalf of the mafia.')
('Judith', "...You're really sure it isn't, right?")
('Van', "Like I said, I can tell you that's NOT why he's<br/>travelin' around.")
('Agnès', "But we can't tell you his actual reasons, since<br/>that's private.")
('Feri', "True—though he made his mess, so now he's got to<br/>clean it up.")
('Quatre', "You don't ease up when it comes to him, do you?")
('Aaron', 'He got up to some other dumb stuff in Langport, too,<br/>but nothing that would cause harm.')
('Risette', "Marduk's assessment of his potential involvement<br/>with Almata was negative as well.")
('Van', 'Your guys really do look into everyone and<br/>everything, huh?')
('Judith', "*sigh* I can't believe I screwed up so bad.<br/>Things haven't been great lately, so I was just<br/>desperate to turn them around...")
('Judith', "Nina won the Lionne d'Or instead of me, another<br/>rival of mine's been doing super good lately...")
('Judith', "I've been trying my hardest, too, but Mom and<br/>Grammy just...")
('Agnès', 'O-Oh, but I loved Golden Blood, too, though!')
('Feri', 'It was a little bit...raunchy, but the action scenes were<br/>so cool!')
('Judith', "Y-You really think so? But I'm not the one who made<br/>it raunchy, just to be clear!")
('Judith', "That's all the director being a filthy pervert! He has to<br/>go for the same sexed-up angles every single time!")
('Quatre', "I'd believe that more if I hadn't seen what you wear<br/>as Grimcat...")
('Aaron', 'Hell, speaking of, you should try getting him to make<br/>a film about Grimcat.')
('Aaron', "There's a role you were born for.")
('Van', "Oh, now THAT I'd pay good money to see.")
('Risette', 'I suspect a lot of people would.')
('Judith', "Hmm... Now that you mention it, he'd probably be<br/>able to get some hot shots out of that catsuit...")
('Judith', "No! HELL no! Never mention that idea<br/>around him ever, or he'd for sure do it!")
('Yumé', "What's a Grimcat? Is it a kitty? I'd watch that!")
('Yumé', "Mmm... I'm not full yet...")
('Quatre', 'Ahaha. Looks like all that running around today<br/>finally caught up to her, huh?')
('Aaron', "She's got a bright future up ahead, this one.")
('Agnès', "We're sorry for all the trouble she ended up causing<br/>you, Judith.")
('Judith', "Oh, it's fine. Don't worry about it.")
('Judith', "Don't think she'll be letting go anytime soon.<br/>You want me to look after her for a while?")
('Judith', "It's been a long day for me, too. We can both have<br/>ourselves a nice nap.")
('Feri', 'A-Are you sure?')
('Van', "If you really don't mind, that'd be great.")
('Agnès', "Thank you. I doubt she'll sleep for more than an hour<br/>or two.")
('Risette', 'If she causes you any fuss or if you need anything,<br/>please let us know.')
('Judith', 'Sure. Can I have your number, then?')
('Van', "(It's not even 10PM yet, so this might be a good time<br/>to head out.)")
('Van', "(Nothin' smells off, but it might be worth walking<br/>around for a bit just in case.)")
('Van', "(I don't want my assistants pickin' up on anything, so<br/>I think I'll leave them be.)")
('Van', '(I should at least go thank Judith personally and<br/>apologize before I head out, though.)')
('Van', '(Looks like someone does live here now after all.<br/>Makes sense. It has been five years.)')
('Van', "(I wonder if it's someone connected to Taito<br/>or Master? Could be just a total stranger, though.)")
('Van', "(Oh, wait. I still haven't talked to Judith.)")
('Van', "(I should get around to that first before I go knockin'<br/>on this door.)")
('Van', "(Maybe this is a good time to stop walkin' around and<br/>give this door a knock?)")
('Van', "(Oh, wait. I still haven't talked to Judith.)")
('Van', '(I should get around to that first.)')
('Warrant Officer Cody', 'Who could have business here this late at night...?')
('Warrant Officer Cody', "I can't believe you actually came...")
('Van', 'Hey. Nice night, huh?')
('Van', "I don't think I've met you before, but I'm thinkin'<br/>you're responsible for spreadin' word about my<br/>work around?")
('Van', 'Well, less you and more the guy who lives here.')
('Warrant Officer Cody', "H-How do you...? Ugh. You're with them,<br/>aren't you?!")
('Van', '(Damn. He a new guy? Though his reaction<br/>definitely says—)')
('Van', "You got me all wrong. My way ain't black, white, or<br/>even gray.")
('Van', "I'm not here to interfere in whatever you're doing.<br/>I was just hopin' to pay my resp—")
('Agnès', 'Umm... What are you doing, Van?')
('Van', '...Oh. You followed me, huh?')
('Feri', 'We happened to notice you looking over this way<br/>earlier today.')
('Quatre', 'You mentioned how you lived in Longlai five years<br/>ago, so we thought this might be where.')
('Aaron', "That, or maybe you'd taken a page out of that dumb<br/>racecar driver's book and this was your local<br/>girl's place.")
('Agnès', '...')
('Van', 'Hell no! Damn brat...')
('Risette', 'Mr. Arkride does not strike me as the proper age for<br/>multiple mistresses and the like.')
('Quatre', "And he's not filthy rich like Maxim, either.")
('Van', 'SO SORRY about that!')
('Warrant Officer Cody', "What's even happening here...? Is this some act to get<br/>me to let my guard down?")
('Warrant Officer Cody', "Well, no matter how outnumbered I am, you won't<br/>get the better of me!")
('Aaron', "Who's this stuck-up bozo?")
('Agnès', "W-We're really sorry about bothering you so late<br/>at night.")
('Risette', "We won't disturb you any longer—")
('Rocksmith', 'Oh, on the contrary. By all means, come in.')
('Quatre', 'Wha...?')
('Aaron', '...Hmm?')
('Agnès', '...')
('Van', "You gotta be kiddin' me...")
('Warrant Officer Cody', 'P-Please stay inside, sir!')
('Rocksmith', "No need to be so on guard around them, Cody.<br/>They're acquaintances of your sister's, as you very<br/>well know.")
('Rocksmith', "They're also highly regarded by Prince Sherid, Fan,<br/>and Professor Hamilton.")
('Rocksmith', 'I think we can at least afford to trust them as much as<br/>the guild does, hmm?')
('Warrant Officer Cody', 'I-I suppose so...')
('Feri', "Umm... So, who's he? Why are you all acting weird?")
('Risette', "It's understandable that you wouldn't know,<br/>Ms. Al-Fayed.")
('Van', 'Yeah—but damn, this is some turn of events.')
('Van', "Until two years ago, you were the most famous man<br/>in the whole Republic. What're you doing in a place<br/>like this?")
('Feri', 'Huh?')
('Rocksmith', 'Haha! A love of surprises seems to be part of the job<br/>description, looking back through the ages.')
('Rocksmith', 'The current occupier of my old job is no exception.')
('Agnès', '...')
('Rocksmith', "Still, if not everyone is aware of who I am, then I'd<br/>best get to introducing myself.")
('Rocksmith', 'My name is Samuel Rocksmith. I am the previous<br/>president of the Republic.')
('Rocksmith', "It's a pleasure to meet you all, Arkride Solutions.")
('Van', 'Ryuga Rouran of the Taito school.')
('Van', "I haven't been able to visit in five years, and heck, we<br/>never even met, but your student told me to give you<br/>his regards.")
('Feri', 'Is Taito another style of Eastern fistfighting?')
('Aaron', "Yeah. It's not as big as the Gekka school, but a whole<br/>lot of skilled warriors use it.")
('Aaron', "The Immovable's part of it, and the Direwolf's<br/>techniques are based off it, too.")
('Quatre', "I'm no expert in these matters, but that makes it<br/>sound quite incredible to me.")
('Van', 'For sure. Unfortunately, when the head of the school<br/>died over ten years ago, his students dispersed all over<br/>the place.')
('Van', 'Since my own master was a friend of his, he looked<br/>after his dojo after that.')
('Van', "That's how I ended up staying here for about half<br/>a year.")
('Agnès', 'Now I see.')
('Agnès', "But the martial art that you know now isn't Taito,<br/>is it?")
('Risette', 'Indeed. Nor is it the Gekka school—I believe it was<br/>called the Kunlun school?')
('Van', "Yeah. It's a school that draws inspiration from both<br/>the East and West.")
('Van', 'My master was Western, but he decided to train in<br/>that school, and then he passed it on to me.')
('Van', 'Fate sure is a funny thing.')
('Feri', 'It feels like fate brought us here, too.')
('Quatre', "Still, does the fact that you're talking about your<br/>master in the past tense mean...?")
('Van', 'Yeah. He died three years ago.')
('Van', "He might've been like a father figure to me, but he<br/>had a boatload of other students—and not all of 'em<br/>in martial arts.")
('Van', "Heard he died protectin' one of his more<br/>respectable ones.")
('Van', "I wish I'd been able to be with him when the time<br/>came, but I guess the least I can do is make an<br/>offering for him here.")
('Agnès', 'Van...')
('Aaron', 'Well...I guess we can join you.')
('Rocksmith', "(So he is the Roaring Lion's unofficial student.)")
('Rocksmith', '(The spriggan who serves as a bridge between light<br/>and darkness...)')
('Rocksmith', "(What a fascinating young man. I'm interested in<br/>everyone with him, too—including her, naturally.)")
('Van', 'So you knew my master and Master Ryuga,<br/>Mr. President?')
('Rocksmith', 'I most certainly did. I met them both in my<br/>younger years.')
('Rocksmith', 'Though I regret to say the opportunity to see them<br/>was rare after I took up office twelve years ago.')
('Rocksmith', "Still, your master and I did come together to mourn<br/>Master Ryuga's passing.")
('Van', 'That makes sense.')
('Aaron', "So, what was your sorta-pops' name?")
('Agnès', 'A-Aaron...')
('Quatre', 'Talk about being oblivious...')
('Rocksmith', "Hmm... I'm not sure if I am at liberty to tell<br/>you that...")
('Van', 'His name was Gunther Barkhorn. He was a traveling<br/>priest for the Septian Church.')
('Aaron', 'Wait, what?')
('Feri', 'So he went around doing work for the church?')
('Agnès', 'Far and wide, yes. That being his profession is a<br/>surprise, though.')
('Risette', 'It certainly is.')
('Quatre', 'So how did a priest become a master of martial arts in<br/>the first place?')
('Van', "Well...he wasn't your ordinary priest, to put it mildly.<br/>I was more an unofficial student of his, but he had a<br/>whole lotta crazy official ones, too.")
('Van', 'Compared to them, I was a total failure—<br/>and honestly? Way more trouble than I was worth.')
('Feri', 'Van...')
('Agnès', 'He sounds like he was a wonderful master and father.')
('Rocksmith', 'That is how I came to be in charge of this residence.')
('Rocksmith', "I've been living in seclusion here ever since conceding<br/>two years ago.")
('Rocksmith', 'I visit the capital on occasion, but I spend most of my<br/>time here living a simple life, enjoying the springs<br/>whenever it suits me.')
('Van', 'What I would give to have a life like that...')
('Rocksmith', 'Hahaha. Perhaps in forty years or so, you can.')
('Rocksmith', 'Speaking of youth, I ought to introduce my<br/>friend here.')
('Warrant Officer Cody', 'Wha—?!')
('Rocksmith', "This is Warrant Officer Cody McMillan.<br/>He's affiliated with Hercules, and a member of the<br/>secret service.")
('Rocksmith', 'He is the younger brother of Second Lieutenant<br/>Kaela McMillan, whom I believe you met in Basel.')
('Agnès', 'Oh, I can see it now.')
('Quatre', "You're right. They do look somewhat alike.")
('Van', 'Two siblings in the CID, huh? So is René your—')
('Warrant Officer Cody', "Hmph. He's not my direct superior, if that's what<br/>you're thinking. Even if he has helped me in<br/>my work.")
('Warrant Officer Cody', "While my sister and I at least have some things in<br/>common with Chief Rouran, we don't see eye to eye<br/>with your friend on very fundamental issues.")
('Van', "...Ah. I get'cha.")
('Feri', 'Hmm? What are you talking about?')
('Aaron', 'Did we just wander into some kinda internal dispute<br/>in the CID?')
('Rocksmith', "Haha. Not quite. I was well acquainted with Cody<br/>and Kaela's father.")
('Rocksmith', 'It was a true shame that he lost his life fighting<br/>against the Empire, but that was what led Cody to<br/>agree to work under me.')
('Warrant Officer Cody', 'M-My father has nothing to do with my motivations,<br/>Mr. President! I serve you because I believe this<br/>country needs you!')
('Warrant Officer Cody', 'You are a far better leader than that cowardly,<br/>shortsighted swindler who—')
('Agnès', '...')
('Rocksmith', 'Cody!')
('Warrant Officer Cody', "I-I'm so sorry, sir! I shouldn't have overstepped<br/>my bounds.")
('Rocksmith', "I understand your intention, and I'm happy that you<br/>think so highly of me, but you never know who could<br/>be listening.")
('Rocksmith', "Besides, the result of the election two years ago was<br/>entirely legitimate. I can't approve of any distortion of<br/>the truth.")
('Warrant Officer Cody', "Yes, but... I'm sorry.")
('Van', "Well, I'm not gonna wade into that dispute...but I<br/>can see you're still a well-connected man,<br/>Mr. President.")
('Van', 'Especially since you were able to arrange this trip for<br/>us while spreading word of our 4SPGs.')
('Feri', "I guess he did mention Crown Prince Sherid's<br/>name earlier...")
('Aaron', "Yeah, and Fan's.")
('Quatre', "And the professor's... Hold on. Then the other<br/>person who invited us here was...")
('Ashen', "Mm-hmm. I'm calling on behalf of Elsaim's Crown<br/>Prince Sherid, the Basel Institute of Science's<br/>Professor Hamilton...")
('Ashen', "...the Kowloon Group's Fan Lu, and one other<br/>individual—whose name I will not disclose—to extend<br/>you an invitation.")
('Rocksmith', 'I would be that individual, yes.')
('Rocksmith', 'I have been acquainted with Grand Prince Salman<br/>and Professor Hamilton since my days in office.')
('Rocksmith', 'I also became acquainted with Elder Gien of Heiyue<br/>during those years... However, he is a rather<br/>frightening fellow.')
('Rocksmith', 'As such, I opted to consult with his son, Fan, on<br/>this occasion.')
('Agnès', 'I see...')
('Aaron', 'Heh. I totally feel you there.')
('Van', 'Okay, I think we get how we came to be here now.<br/>Still got a big question, though.')
('Van', 'Why would a former president want to speak with a<br/>shady spriggan like me, and why go so far to do it?')
('Van', "I can't picture you wanting to hire us for anything,<br/>considering your position.")
('Agnès', "That's a fair point...")
('Feri', 'Umm...')
('Risette', "It wouldn't be a very wise decision politically, true.")
('Quatre', 'Yeah. The current ruling party would absolutely take<br/>advantage of it if they found out. It would pose too<br/>great a risk.')
('Warrant Officer Cody', "Y-You think he hasn't thought of that?!")
('Rocksmith', "Hahaha. You are absolutely right—I didn't bring<br/>you here to hire you for anything.")
('Rocksmith', "That said, I'm well aware of the good work you've<br/>been doing all over the country.")
('Rocksmith', 'Whether it was in Creil, Langport, Tharbad,<br/>or Basel.')
('Rocksmith', 'As you know, all of those surface incidents were<br/>caused by Almata...')
('Rocksmith', '...but I believe there are deeper issues they share<br/>at their core.')
('Rocksmith', "It's been two years since the war ended.")
('Rocksmith', 'The unprecedented prosperity our country has been<br/>blessed with has pushed the problems we have always<br/>had into the background.')
('Rocksmith', 'However, they never went away, and their effects are<br/>starting to be felt once more.')
('Agnès', '...')
('Van', '...')
('Aaron', "...Well, the mafia's always gonna be a problem.")
('Quatre', "And it's true that Professor Callaghan's descent didn't<br/>start with them...")
('Feri', 'Jaeger corps all over have been getting a lot<br/>busier lately...')
('Risette', 'As has Marduk.')
('Agnès', "Perhaps you're right that these deeper issues are<br/>beginning to rear their ugly heads.")
('Agnès', "And the one who's guided us to this point is...")
('Feri', '...?')
('Quatre', '(...Why does she look so gloomy?)')
('Aaron', '(...Hmph.)')
('Van', "Either way, the boost the reparations provided to<br/>various fields is close to comin' to an end.")
('Van', "Calvard's real strength is about to be tested.")
('Van', "I can't imagine our president hasn't seen this<br/>comin', either.")
('Van', "The monumental change we've seen ain't gonna come<br/>without aftershocks. You can count on that.")
('Quatre', "To be sure. They're likely to extend beyond the<br/>economy and into the field of technology, too.")
('Aaron', "All those dipshits whining about 'the immigrants' are<br/>gonna come crawling out the woodwork like rats<br/>again, huh?")
('Risette', 'The same people whose racially motivated acts of<br/>terrorism led to the economic crisis a few years ago.')
('Feri', "That's all worrying to hear...")
('Rocksmith', 'Worrying, yes, but all of that was also what led me to<br/>want to meet with you.')
('Rocksmith', 'We live in highly turbulent times, with countless<br/>forces of light and darkness at work in this<br/>young Republic.')
('Rocksmith', "But we have you: a group like no other. Not heroes of<br/>justice like the guild, nor the CID who maintains<br/>balance on the government's behalf.")
('Rocksmith', 'You work alongside groups on both sides of the moral<br/>spectrum, while having your own distinct style all<br/>the same.')
('Rocksmith', 'And I can only hope that you will be a powerful force<br/>in carving a future for our country.')
('Aaron', "Heh. You're even craftier than I'd heard.")
('Quatre', 'Though it is motivating to have all of that said<br/>about you.')
('Feri', "I don't know how much I'll be able to help, but I'm<br/>here for whatever you need!")
('Risette', 'As someone who lives and works in this country, I<br/>want it to be a peaceful and prosperous one.')
('Agnès', 'Everyone...')
('Van', "Heh. Can't help but feel like you're thinkin' a little<br/>TOO highly of us.")
('Van', "But this is one connection I'd wager is well worth<br/>having, even if it might bite us back one day.")
('Rocksmith', "I'm glad you feel that way. I can see I was right to<br/>invite you here after all.")
('Van', 'I hope we can have a long and fruitful relationship,<br/>Mr. President.')
('Van', "We're more than happy to take on jobs for you,<br/>providin' you bring 'em in through the back door.")
('Van', 'And so long as the pay and profile fit our standards,<br/>of course.')
('Rocksmith', 'Hahaha! I am delighted to hear that.')
('Rocksmith', 'May this partnership serve us well,<br/>Van Arkride.')
(500, 'November 14th, 11:02PM')
('Aaron', "Okay, yeah, he was about as sharp as you'd expect a<br/>former president to be.")
('Aaron', "Easy to see how he could keep up with Heiyue's<br/>elders when negotiating as president.")
('Risette', 'Indeed. I believe the two sides worked together to<br/>stop terrorists at the trade conference four years ago.')
('Risette', 'The current president is a formidable figure in his<br/>own right, but the former president has clearly lost<br/>none of his skill.')
('Van', "I got the impression he's still working with the<br/>current opposition party, too.")
('Van', "Not that it seemed like he had any interest in draggin'<br/>us into any political squabbling.")
('Agnès', "I agree. I believe he came to us purely as an individual<br/>thinking of Calvard's future.")
('Agnès', "...I'm really glad I got to talk to him. I feel like I<br/>learned so much from the experience.")
('Quatre', "He also spoke to you in private after we were all done,<br/>didn't he?")
('Feri', 'Oh, I noticed that, too.')
('Agnès', "Ahaha... He did, but we didn't discuss anything of<br/>real importance.")
('Rocksmith', 'I have to admit, I was surprised to learn about you<br/>working for Arkride Solutions.')
('Rocksmith', "I can't imagine Roy is none the wiser of that<br/>fact, either.")
('Agnès', 'You know my dad?')
('Agnès', "W-Well, I mean, you know him in a professional<br/>capacity, obviously, but you make it sound like you're<br/>more personally acquainted.")
('Rocksmith', "Haha. I suppose it makes sense that you wouldn't<br/>know this...")
('Rocksmith', '...but before establishing the Patriot League as a<br/>party, Roy was part of the Republican Party just<br/>like me.')
('Rocksmith', 'The two of us were on very friendly terms indeed<br/>when he first delved into politics after leaving the<br/>armed forces.')
('Rocksmith', 'I also knew your mother. I even remember meeting<br/>you when you were still a baby.')
('Agnès', 'I had no idea...')
('Agnès', "...I'm not ignorant about what happened in the<br/>election two years ago.")
('Agnès', 'So much scheming went on behind the scenes to<br/>remove you from office.')
('Agnès', 'And the man responsible for it all was—')
('Rocksmith', "That's just how the world of politics is, young lady.")
('Rocksmith', 'The 23rd president of the Calvard Republic that<br/>came of it has brought us unprecedented prosperity.')
('Rocksmith', 'He is also standing tall as a force to be reckoned<br/>with—for better or for worse—in the current world in<br/>which we live.')
('Rocksmith', 'Besides, nothing in politics is inherently good or evil<br/>in the present. Morality is solely for history to judge.')
('Rocksmith', 'All we politicians must do is ensure that our fair<br/>republic is deemed right.')
('Rocksmith', 'Be that through leading it to greatness—or offering<br/>an alternative should our leaders lose their way.')
('Rocksmith', 'Such is the life of ones in our position.')
('Agnès', 'Mr. President...')
('Rocksmith', 'All that said, you just leave the burden of politics to<br/>us adults for now.')
('Rocksmith', 'I would rather you keep your focus on what you want<br/>to achieve.')
('Agnès', 'Then I will. Thank you, Mr. President!')
('Agnès', '...')

('Yumé', 'Yep!')

('Judith', "*yawn* Don't worry about it. We had a good nap<br/>between us.")
('Judith', "You had to be up early today, too, didn't you?<br/>You should probably hit the hay yourselves.")
('Van', "Can't argue with you there. You guys good to head<br/>back to our rooms, then?")
('Quatre', 'I know I am. I might pass out as soon as I hit the bed.')
('Yumé', 'Now I get to sleep with Agnès and Feri!')
('Agnès', "That's right—we did say we were going to do that.")

('Van', '(Oh, right. There was fog out in Langport when his<br/>friends were...)')
('Feri', "I can't find her anywhere...")
('Agnès', "Maybe she's gone into the boys' room?")
('Aaron', 'Hmm?')
('Quatre', "What's that all about?")
('Van', "What's up?")
('Feri', '...')
('Agnès', "I don't see her...")

('Quatre', "Who isn't? What's going on?")
('Aaron', "What's all the noise first thing in the morning?<br/>...Wait. Where's the kid?")
('Feri', "I'll check just in case: Yumé hasn't been in your room,<br/>has she?")
('Feri', 'Sh-She was supposed to be sleeping with us, but<br/>when we woke up, she was nowhere to be found!')

('System', 'After learning this, they decided to split up and<br/>search the town.')
('Van', "We're gonna head out now, but I want you to stand<br/>by at the inn in case anyone tries to get in contact.")
('Van', 'If you learn anything from the police or the guild, call<br/>us right away and let us know.')
('Risette', "Understood. I'll see if I can find anything on the orbal<br/>network while I wait.")
('Risette', 'Please, do all that you can to bring her back safely.')
('Judith', 'We will.')
('Judith', "*sigh* She's one little troublemaker, isn't she?")
('Judith', 'Maybe she just had so much energy she decided to<br/>work it all off? ...Doubtful. She seems too well<br/>behaved for that.')
('Van', "Yeah. Her mom's brought her up right.")
('Van', "I'm sorry for draggin' you into our problems again.<br/>We're kinda ruining your vacation, aren't we?")
('Judith', "Not at all. We spent a lot of time together yesterday,<br/>so I'm as worried about her as you are at this point.")
('Judith', "Thankfully, I don't think it'll take us that long to find<br/>her with this many people.")
('Judith', "Those two robots—FIO and XEROS, was it?—<br/>seem like they'll be a big help in the search.")
('Van', "Yeah. The sensors those things have got are<br/>somethin' else—if she's in town, they'll find her.")
('Van', "In the meantime, we're gonna go around askin'<br/>people if they've seen her just in case and see if we<br/>can find her that way.")
('Judith', "Hmm? Do you have some useful app on your Xipha<br/>that'll help find her?")
('Van', "Nah. It's just that something's up with the holo I use.")
('Van', "She just stopped respondin' to me this morning.<br/>Can't even get her to appear now.")
('Judith', "That's weird...")
('Van', "Something might've happened overnight.")
('Van', "Anyway, let's get to work.")
('Judith', 'O-Okay, got it. Oh, wait—I need to put these<br/>on first.')
('System', 'Judith joined the party.')

('System', 'After returning to Longlai, they contacted everyone<br/>who had been helping with the search to let them<br/>know Yumé was all right.')

('System', 'That night, they were all invited by the former<br/>president to his residence...')

('Risette', 'Mr. Arkride, is something amiss?')
('Quatre', "What's going on, Van?")
('System', 'Is there something on your mind?')
('Aaron', 'Something eating you?')
('Quatre', 'Did something occur to you?')
('Yumé', "What's over there?")

('Van', "(No reason to bring a bunch of people over. I'll go<br/>there later on my own.)")
('Yumé', 'Zzz... Zzz... Mmnn...')
('Judith', "Haha! She's such a darling. You said she's the<br/>granddaughter of your office's landlord?")
('Van', 'Yeah. They run a pretty popular bistro, actually.')
('Van', "My office is on the second floor, and all my<br/>part-timers are rentin' rooms on the third...")
('Judith', 'Aha! So your whole crew is beholden to a single lord<br/>of landing!')
('Judith', 'That seems nice, in a way. You never have to worry<br/>about where to get a bite, right?')
('Van', "True enough. The guy's list of complaints never ends,<br/>but he knows how to keep the food nutritious.")
('Van', "Which pays for me, at this point. Half my crew are<br/>kids who're still growin'.")
('Judith', "Agh... Now I'm actually feeling kinda jealous.")
('Judith', 'I wish I could live a nice, balanced life<br/>like that.')
('Judith', 'My meals and schedule keep getting messed up, what<br/>with industry dinners and invites from sponsors<br/>and whatnot.')
('Judith', "I guess that's one advantage to my side business. It's a<br/>decent way to spend some calories!")
('Van', "Don't tell me your phantom thief thing is just a fancy<br/>way to lose weight.")
('Judith', "O-Of course not! That's ridiculous! It's just a plus,<br/>that's all!")
('Judith', 'Besides, I think I look just fine, thank you! Not like<br/>YOU had any complaints when you saw—')
('Judith', '...MRRGH!')
('Van', "Yeah, uhh, about that. I'm real, real...real sorry.<br/>I wasn't bein' the most considerate about it.")
('Van', "I'll do whatever you'd like to apologize.")
('Judith', "Ugh. It's fine. Not like I haven't put that much up on<br/>the big screen before, anyway.")
('Judith', "Compared to some of the sex scenes and stuff in the<br/>R-17 versions of some of Gotti's movies, a quick<br/>semi-nude barely registers.")
('Van', 'Damn, though, you really are a pro. Not gonna say no<br/>to sketchy stuff like that?')
('Van', "I'd figure your agency would shoot stuff like that<br/>down in a heartbeat.")
('Judith', "They don't like it, but I usually convince them to give<br/>it the green light. It can be a part of making a<br/>movie that much better.")
('Judith', "Now, my mom's the one who really gets on my case<br/>about it. I'm SO tired of hearing that I shouldn't be<br/>'loose,' that I need to save myself fo—")
('Judith', '—ffffowhy am I telling you these things?!')
('Van', "You say that, but you're the one who keeps walkin'<br/>into it. Still... It's not bad, havin' family that cares at<br/>least, right?")
('Van', 'Your grandma was a former chanson singer, yeah?<br/>And your mom was big on the stage, right?')
('Judith', "I'm...surprised you know them. I mean, they're not a<br/>secret, but that was a while back.")
('Van', "Well, they both left a big mark on the world. I still<br/>see some of your mom's posters on the walls in<br/>some bars.")
('Van', "As for your grandma, I've heard her on<br/>records before. Three generations of artistic<br/>talent, huh?")
('Judith', "Yes, well! We're blessed, it's true.")
('Judith', "I'm still nowhere near the phantom thief Mom was,<br/>but I think I'm at least living up to her legacy as an<br/>actress—")
('Judith', "Agh! And here I go again! I swear, I can't let my<br/>guard down around you for a second!")
('Van', "At this point, I'm contractually obligated to point out<br/>you keep walkin' into these yourself...")
('Yumé', "Mmnn... I'm gonna be a movie star, too...")
('Van', "(Well, I took a dip before dinner, but it's great to be<br/>able to go in multiple times a day...)")
('Van', '(Should I take another quick dip to help<br/>digest dinner?)')
('Van', 'Phew...')
('Van', '(Five years since then, huh?)')
('Van', "(Never imagined this'd be how I'd end up back here.)")
('Van', '(Come to think of it, we made a promise to go on a<br/>hot springs trip way back when, huh?)')
('Van', "(It was, what, gonna be to celebrate René's<br/>graduation? Then I ruined the whole thing.)")
('Van', '(...Whatever. No turning back the clock now.)')
('Van', "(I already made my choice. I've thrown away my days<br/>with them.)")
('Quatre', "...Okay. Looks like no one's around. I knew the best<br/>time to shoot for would be right after dinner.")
('Quatre', "I'll really be in for it if Aaron finds me, so I'll make<br/>this a short dip.")
('Quatre', 'I did only just take a shower... Hopefully a quick wash<br/>is good enough before going in.')
('Quatre', "Haha. I can barely see a thing. There's so<br/>much steam.")
('Quatre', 'It really is curious how the oxidation of sulfur can<br/>come out so thick.')
('Quatre', 'As I recall, it has a positive effect on the skin and<br/>soothes chronic pain. Maybe I should convince Gran<br/>and Essy to come!')
('Van', 'Man, you sure know your stuff, huh?')
('Quatre', '...H-Huh? WHAT?! V-VAN?!')
('Van', "Oh, yeah. Sorry—I've been in for a while now.<br/>Real nice bath, huh?")
('Quatre', '...')
('Van', "Sorry I didn't say anything earlier. I was kinda lost<br/>in thought.")
('Van', "You wanted to have the place to yourself, yeah?<br/>I'm all warmed up, so I'll leave it to you.")
('Quatre', 'Uhh, Van! I can see everything!')
('Van', "Huh? What're you talking about? I got a towel<br/>around my waist.")
('Quatre', "B-But your upper body... You're naked!<br/>Your incredible muscles and such are...visible!")
('Quatre', "Agh! Forget that! I didn't say anything!")
('Van', "Hah! C'mon, I'm not that great compared to folks<br/>who really make a habit of flexin' their muscles.")
('Van', "Anyway, you wanted the place, so I'm good leavin'<br/>you to it. You should have around half an hour before<br/>anyone else comes in, I think.")
('Van', "Don't stay in for too long right after eatin',<br/>though, okay? Also, remember to hydrate once<br/>you're done.")
('Quatre', 'Th-That...was a shock.')
('Quatre', '(I suppose I was at fault. I should have made sure no<br/>one was here first.)')
('Quatre', "(He...didn't notice, did he?)")
('Quatre', "(No. He couldn't have. There shouldn't be that much<br/>to see in just the builds of our bodies.)")
('Quatre', "(I think the heat's getting to me. Once I wash myself,<br/>I'll head out.)")
('Van', "(Atta boy. Looks like he's makin' sure to hydrate after<br/>his bath.)")
('Van', '(Huh? Was that a westerner in a kimono?)')
('Van', '(Probably just a tourist or someone renting one...)')
('Van', '(...)')
('Van', "(Hmm... Well, at least they're not a ghost.)")
('Van', "(Now the question is—do I pursue, or do I just<br/>pretend I saw nothin'?)")
('Kimono Woman', 'Ahh... What a lovely breeze.')
('Kimono Woman', 'I had merely hoped for a light break, but I feel almost<br/>spoiled with how pleasant this has been.')
('Van', '(Her voice is pretty familiar...)')
('Kimono Woman', 'Out for a little stroll, handsome? You strike me as<br/>a tourist. From the capital, perhaps?')
('Van', '...Yeah. Just here to kick back a little.')
('Van', "How about you? Relaxin' solo? Can't imagine<br/>someone like you'd be out here alone.")
('Kimono Woman', "Oh, quite sadly, it's just me, myself, and I this time.")
('Kimono Woman', 'I must admit to being a touch lonely without my<br/>oh-so naughty superior and rambunctious coworker.')
('Kimono Woman', "I have an idea... Won't you be my arm candy instead?")
('Van', "...That's a very appealing invitation, but I'm afraid<br/>I've got some business to attend to.")
('Van', "'Sides, the kids in my crew would never let me hear<br/>the end of it if they found us. Think I could take a<br/>rain check?")
('Kimono Woman', 'Goodness me. My hopes have been dashed.')
('Kimono Woman', 'Well, then, have a delightful night—and may you not<br/>end up a plaything for anything too nasty.')
('Van', "(The fact that I can't remember makes this all the<br/>more strange, but this is definitely not a situation to<br/>poke my nose into.)")
('Van', "(A liminal city between East and West, the Kunlun<br/>and the Tianshan mountains... Think I'll just say I<br/>met a fox playin' at being human here.)")
('Van', '(Mmm. With that said, this fox definitely has all<br/>nine tails.)')
('Judith', 'What is this place?')
('Van', "Well, let's say there's someone livin' out their<br/>retirement here who knows the land. Thought it<br/>might be wise to check in with them.")
('Warrant Officer Cody', 'That voice... You came back, did you?')
('Rocksmith', "Now, now, Cody. That's not a polite way to treat<br/>our guests. Surely they came because they have<br/>some business.")
('Rocksmith', 'Well, well, Arkride. Is the person with you...?')
('Warrant Officer Cody', "Wh-What?! She can't be...THE Judith Lanster?!")
('Warrant Officer Cody', 'Why in the world would a top actress be with<br/>a spriggan?!')
('Van', "(Heh. Didn't fool 'em for a second.)")
('Judith', '(S-Shut up! More importantly...)')
('Judith', 'Are you...the former President Rocksmith?! Why in<br/>the world are—')
('Judith', "Wait. 'Someone living out their retirement...'")
('Rocksmith', 'Hmm... I dare say something must have<br/>happened, yes?')
('Van', "Yeah. If you'll hear me out—")
('System', "Van explained how Yumé, the granddaughter of<br/>Montmart's owner, disappeared mysteriously this<br/>morning to Rocksmith.")
('Rocksmith', 'Goodness. The bistro girl went missing?')
('Van', "Hold on. You're familiar with Montmart,<br/>Mr. Rocksmith?")
('Rocksmith', 'Oh, yes. That shop is quite well known among<br/>certain circles.')
('Rocksmith', 'To tell you the truth, I would stop by there for private<br/>business sometimes when I was still president.')
('Rocksmith', 'The owner knew who I was, of course, but he was<br/>happy to turn a blind eye and serve me like just<br/>another customer.')
('Van', 'Man. Small world, huh?')
('Van', 'I guess that would mean you definitely knew about<br/>my office for a while, then.')
('Rocksmith', 'Haha. Yes, it does mean that.')
('Rocksmith', "Now, with that said, I'd be more than happy to help<br/>find the little lady.")
('Rocksmith', "I'm afraid to say no such girl has come anywhere<br/>near here.")
('Rocksmith', 'Considering the situation, however, that makes it all<br/>the more concerning.')
('Rocksmith', 'I hope this turns out to be nothing more than an<br/>ordinary missing persons case, but one never knows...')
('Judith', 'Wait, the situation? What situation?')
('Rocksmith', "Ahh. Well, I'm sure Mr. Arkride has a sense of<br/>it already. But of late, there's been an odd presence<br/>haunting Longlai.")
('Rocksmith', 'Or say, rather, haunting the entire region of Longlai.')
('Rocksmith', "The guild believes it to be an unknown monster, and<br/>there's been a number of people who've noticed an<br/>unfamiliar presence in the mountains.")
('Van', '...')
('Rocksmith', "I suppose that isn't the sort of comment you'd expect<br/>from a former president, hmm? Let's just say I've seen<br/>many things in my time.")
('Rocksmith', 'Though perhaps it would be better to say I had to<br/>learn to accept and deal with the inexplicable not long<br/>before I retired.')
('Van', 'Hah. Yeah, no surprise.<br/>(He probably means the events in Crossbell and the<br/>Empire a few years back.)')
('Judith', "(Come to think of it, that monster who attacked<br/>me yesterday... It definitely didn't feel normal.)")
('Van', "(Guess that wasn't just my imagination.)")
('Van', "Anyway, at least that makes it clear Longlai's in some<br/>deeper shit than we thought.")
('Van', "We'll go check with other eyewitnesses, but thanks<br/>for cluin' us in about the weird stuff.")
('Rocksmith', "You have my best wishes, Mr. Arkride. If we find or<br/>remember something of use, I'll be in touch.")
('Warrant Officer Cody', 'I will go get in touch with our various contacts, then.')
('Rocksmith', 'If you would. Mr. Arkride, if you need help, you have<br/>only to ask.')
('Van', 'Yeah. Much appreciated.')
('Judith', 'A strange presence... You know, I DID kind of<br/>feel something. So does this mean someone else is up<br/>to something here?')
('Van', "Even if it doesn't, it helps to keep aware of it. It could<br/>be related to why Yumé's gone missing.")
('Van', 'Anyway, we need to collect more information<br/>for now.')
('Judith', 'R-Right!')
('Judith', "Longlai Station... Oh, right. Doesn't the<br/>Transcontinental Railroad pass through here?")
('Judith', 'I really doubt Yumé boarded the train alone,<br/>but still...')
('Van', 'Yeah. That said, it never hurts to ask.')
('Van', "It IS morning, and it's plenty possible that the fog is<br/>disruptin' the train schedules, but it still doesn't hurt.")
('System', 'Van and Judith talked to the station staff and<br/>discovered that, as they had thought, the fog had<br/>reduced the train traffic.')
('System', "With few passengers, the staff could say confidently<br/>that no one matching Yumé's description had passed<br/>the ticket gate.")
('Judith', "Hmm... Our girl is pretty recognizable. If she'd<br/>passed the ticket gate, someone would have noticed,<br/>I think.")
('Judith', "The buses probably aren't running yet, either.")
('Van', 'Yeah. And this is just a hunch, but...')
('Van', "...I'd bet she wouldn't go outside the range of this fog.")
('Judith', 'Huh? What does that—')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "Why, it's you. Enjoying a romantic rendezvous in the<br/>early morning fog?")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'Hello there. Enjoying a little tourism in the early<br/>morning fog?')
('Van', 'Oh, uhh...<br/>(So I guess this fox shows up during the day,<br/>too, huh?)')
('Judith', 'A-A ro-ro-rom... Wait! You know her?!')
('Van', 'Nah. Just someone I ran into last night.')
('Van', '...?<br/>(The way she talks...)')
('Judith', 'U-Umm...?')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "I must say, I don't believe this beauty is part of your<br/>business trip, is she? Clearly you are a man of<br/>high standards.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'Hmm? Do I recognize you from somewhere, miss?')
('Judith', "U-Uhh, do you? And, uh, I mean, you're pretty<br/>lovely yourself! That kimono is great.")
('Judith', 'Your hair really goes well with the ensemble, too.<br/>Do you work with clothes?')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'Oh, no, no. This is a hobby, not work. My normal<br/>outfits are far stuffier than this.')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "Now, if I may pry, you both seem troubled. Might I<br/>ask what's troubling you?")
('Judith', 'W-Well...')
('Van', '...Yeah. As it happens—')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'Aha. I think I know the girl. About six or seven<br/>years old?')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'She had her hair up in an adorable ponytail.')
('Van', "That's her, all right.")
('Judith', 'Did you see her somewhere recently?!')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "Hmm... As it happens, I caught a glimpse of her as<br/>I'd finished checking out of my lodgings. About an<br/>hour ago.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "She seemed to be having fun, sniffing about the<br/>springs' source by the riverside.")
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'I was going to approach her—a little girl like that?<br/>Out on her own on a foggy morning?')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', 'However, she was with a somewhat older boy who<br/>seemed a decent sort, so I assumed he could<br/>be trusted.')
('Van', '...Okay, then. Who was the boy?')
('Judith', "It was Senri, I believe. You may have met him—the<br/>boy who's working as a guide?")
('Judith', 'I recall he spends his time around the souvenir shop.<br/>Perhaps you should check there.')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "Much as I'd be delighted to help you further, it seems<br/>my train's just arrived. Do forgive me, hmm?")
('Judith', 'What?')
('Van', 'Tch...')
('System', '—Thank you for your patience. The Edith-bound<br/>passenger train will be arriving momentarily.')
('System', 'Due to the fog, the number of departures has<br/>been reduced. We advise passengers to ensure<br/>you board...')
('Lucrezia the Golden Butterfly', "Now, you'd best be off to find your girl. Who knows<br/>what sort of peril she could get into on a day such<br/>as this?")
('Judith', '...?!')
('System', 'This is Longlai Station, Longlai Station. This train<br/>will be stopping here for ten minutes.<br/>All passengers—')
('Judith', "Umm, just who the hell was she? She clearly wasn't<br/>some average woman!")
('Van', "Worst of all, she didn't feel any need to hide it.<br/>Either way—we can just ignore that little question<br/>for now.")
('Van', "Let's get over to the souvenir shop. We gotta catch<br/>that guide kid.")
('Judith', "Of course! Come on, let's hurry!")
('Guide Senri', 'O-Oh, there you are! Great! I was looking for you!')
('Guide Senri', "That girl you've been looking for, Yumé—I saw her<br/>alone a little while ago and I was wondering if she<br/>was okay.")
('Guide Senri', 'Are you searching for her too?')
('Van', "Yeah. Our group's split up to look for her.")
('Van', 'I heard you talked to her for a bit. Any idea where<br/>she went?')
('Guide Senri', 'W-Well, she was wandering around, cheery as<br/>could be. I talked to her for a bit, and then she just...<br/>took off!')
('Guide Senri', 'She was staring at all the things around town like it<br/>was all special... It was hard to follow her. She seemed<br/>different, kinda.')
('Guide Senri', "Then I looked away for one hot second, and she<br/>somehow disappeared. I'm so sorry I lost her!")
('Judith', 'Hmm... Did you notice anything else? When did you<br/>see her?')
('Guide Senri', "I wasn't watching the clock, so I'm not sure<br/>exactly, but... It was right as I started cleaning, so it<br/>would've been about an hour ago.")
('Guide Senri', "Oh! I dunno if it's any help, but she was carrying a<br/>fantuan around with her.")
('Guide Senri', "She must've bought it from the stand over there, but<br/>she was staring at it like she didn't even know what it<br/>was while walking around.")
('Van', "That's...odd. She was with us when we went by the<br/>stand that sells fantuan yesterday.")
('Judith', 'Sure, but I mean, kids are like that, right?')
('Van', 'Maybe. Still think we should keep it in mind.')
('Van', "Also, you're sure nothin' else stood out? Anything, no<br/>matter how small.")
('Guide Senri', 'Well, she seemed to be weirdly focused on the Ishgal<br/>Mountains to the south.')
('Guide Senri', "That's where the fog's rolling in from, so I can<br/>understand why she was kinda interested in it, but it<br/>was still weird.")
('Guide Senri', 'I told her that the mountains are off limits right now,<br/>and she just smiled and disappeared soon after.')
('Van', "Hmm... It sounds like Yumé wasn't actin' the way she<br/>normally does. We need a little more info to compare<br/>this to.")
('Van', 'Anyway, thanks a bunch. This might be real valuable.')
('Guide Senri', "Yeah, of course. I'm just glad to have helped! If I find<br/>her, I'll let you know right away!")
('Agnès', 'Oh! Van, Judith...')
('XEROS', 'WOOF!')
('Quatre', 'Have you found anything on your end?')
('Quatre', "We've been having XEROS run around in search<br/>mode, but we've had little luck.")
('Quatre', 'We were just talking about that, as well as updating<br/>the Bracer Guild with our findings.')
('Van', "I got some eyewitness testimonies, but it's not enough<br/>to go on yet.")
('Van', "If I can find a little more we can look it over.<br/>Sounds like you're a bust, though.")
('Van', "Since she's not turnin' up with our search, that can<br/>only mean she went outside the range of<br/>XEROS' 'nose.'")
('Van', "Which means we're gonna have to depend on the<br/>guild's ability to investigate.")
('Agnès', "Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like they have<br/>anything yet. We did file a formal request to search<br/>for her, though.")
('Receptionist Drusilla', "Between the fog and yesterday's events, I have a very<br/>bad feeling about this whole thing.")
('Receptionist Drusilla', 'As it happens, Kazan and Gray are out on<br/>morning patrol.')
('Receptionist Drusilla', "I did contact them, but... Ah! Kazan's back.")
('Bracer Kazan', 'No good, Drusilla. I went all the way to the waterfall<br/>and found nothing.')
('Bracer Kazan', "Oh, good! You're here. That makes this easy.<br/>Unfortunately, all I can say is that there's no sign of<br/>your girl up to the waterfall.")
('Receptionist Drusilla', 'You came to that conclusion quickly. Any proof?')
('Bracer Kazan', 'Oh, come on. You know me—I was born and raised<br/>in the mountains.')
('Bracer Kazan', 'There was no trace of anyone else in the mountains<br/>but me. I even checked the path on my way back.')
('Bracer Kazan', "I saw no sign of a child's footprints or any indicator<br/>she was there at all. Naturally, the next step will be to<br/>head out to the eastern highway.")
('Receptionist Drusilla', "Well, as you heard. Gray's checking the western<br/>highway, for what it's worth.")
('Receptionist Drusilla', "But it doesn't seem like he's found any trace of your<br/>girl, either.")
('Agnès', '...I see.')
('Agnès', 'Still, that does limit the number of places she could<br/>have gone.')
('Agnès', "If she hasn't been to the waterfall or the highways,<br/>then either she's still in town, or...")
('Receptionist Drusilla', "We'll continue searching on our end. If she's gone out<br/>of town, the situation could get much worse.")
('Receptionist Drusilla', "If she's not near the waterfall or the western highway,<br/>the alternatives are quite a bit more dangerous.")
('Quatre', "...I can't help but worry.")
('Van', '...')
('Van', "Either way, we can't just run around with no clues.<br/>We need to get more info to focus our search.")
('Judith', "For sure. Let's keep looking around.")
('Feri', 'Van, Judith! Have you found anything?')
('Feri', 'We checked to see if the temple had seen any sign<br/>of Yumé.')
('Van', "We got a bit to go on. Can't say it's all that solid yet.")
('Van', 'We need a little more. You got anything on your end?')
('Van', 'From the looks of it, nothing useful on your end?')
('Aaron', "Well, we can say for sure that she didn't come to<br/>the temple. We hit up the other attendees, too.")
('Vicar Murase', 'Yes—it seems a girl likely to be your child was sighted<br/>early in the morning.')
('Priest Izumi', 'I fear that information is now twenty minutes old.')
('Aaron', 'Damn. Could be that...')
('Judith', "She could've left town, then. That would be bad.")
('Van', "Even so, knowin' what she did after could be critical.")
('Van', "We can't run around like headless chickens. We need<br/>a clear picture of what happened.")
('Vicar Murase', "If we discover anything more, we'll be sure to<br/>contact you.")
('Priest Izumi', 'May the Heavenly Mother guide us all.')
('Van', 'Yeah. Thanks.')
('Van', "Okay, we've hit up everyone we could ask.")
('Van', "I think at this point we can pin down<br/>Yumé's movements.")
('Feri', "Hmm... The info seems like kind of a mess to me.<br/>But you've got an idea, right, Van?")
('Van', "Yep. From what the temple and Senri said, it's been a<br/>while since Yumé was last seen.")
('Risette', 'The Tourism Bureau and the guild were looking into<br/>the buildings a child could hide in. However...')
('Risette', 'We were just updated, and they found no sign of her.')
('Quatre', 'So she must have left town...')
('Agnès', 'We had the guild check outside of town.')
('Van', "From what we've gathered, she at least hasn't gone to<br/>the waterfall or down the western highway.")
('Judith', "No sign of her at the station, either, so she didn't hop<br/>the train.")
('Agnès', 'The other possibility at this point would have to be...')
('Feri', '...she headed south—on the mountain roads that lead<br/>into the Ishgal Mountains.')
('Aaron', 'Holy... The brat headed out there alone?!')
('Aaron', "That's where the fog is at its worst, too.")
('Judith', 'From what Senri said, Yumé seemed to be somehow<br/>focused on it.')
('Van', "Yeah. We can't say why at the moment, but it's our<br/>best lead.")
('Risette', "If that is true, we need to be ready for anything.<br/>However, for Yumé's sake, we also need to depart as<br/>soon as possible.")
('Van', 'Yeah...')
('Agnès', 'Van?')
('Van', "There's just something bothering me.")
('Judith', 'Oh, right. Your custom holo stopped working, right?')
('Feri', 'Wait. That means...')
('Van', "Normally you wouldn't think there'd be a connection.<br/>Hard to believe it's a coincidence, though.")
('Agnès', 'Ah! Van, look!')
('Agnès', "It's not as strong a reaction as other times, but...")
('Quatre', 'Yes. It seems to be vibrating, if only slightly.')
('Risette', 'Could it be a kind of low-power mode? That is quite<br/>common on more modern orbments.')
('Agnès', "If this is related to Yumé's disappearance...")
('Van', "Considerin' everything we've seen to date, we'd better<br/>keep it in mind.")
('Judith', "Sounds like we're all in agreement, at least. Let's get<br/>going after her!")
('Van', 'Wait, why are you—')
('Judith', "I'm already part of this. Did you really think I'd just<br/>say, 'Oh, sorry! Good luck out in mountain hell'?")
('Judith', "I mean, I've stuck with you this far, why would I go<br/>durdling off now?")
('Judith', "And honestly, I've got the power TO involve myself.<br/>I can't just turn a blind eye to this.")
('Aaron', 'Heh. Pretty badass of you.')
('Aaron', "Okay, then! Let's see what a proud, principled thief—<br/>or, you know, a kinkster—can do for us, huh?")
('Judith', "Why'd you have to go and throw the kinkster bit<br/>in there?!")
('Judith', 'Rrr! You just watch!')
('Van', '...Hah, fine.')
('Agnès', 'It would be very reassuring to have you with<br/>us, Judith.')
('Feri', "Anyway, if we're ready, we should get going!")
('Risette', "We must make sure we're properly<br/>equipped, however.")
('Van', "Yeah. There's no guessin' what we might find<br/>out there. Load up for bear, everyone.")
('Tsuruji', "We're a hands-on shop. We love helping our visitors<br/>enjoy making things!")
('Tsuruji', 'If this is your first time doing this sort of thing, I<br/>recommend making a wind chime. How about you<br/>and your friends give it a try?')
('Van', "(A hands-on workshop, huh? Not somethin' you get<br/>to do much, so that could be fun.)")
('Van', '(We did give this a spin already... But hey, vacation<br/>time, right?)')
('Van', "(Wait. I'm with someone who's already done this.<br/>Should I go change up the crew?)")
('System', 'Spend free time on making wind chimes?')
('Yumé', 'Umm... Are we gonna make the little ring-a-lings?')
('Yumé', 'Wow! I really wanna try!')
('Feri', "Wind chimes! I'm not familiar with these<br/>kinda chimes.")
('Feri', "We don't have these among the Kruga, so I'd be glad<br/>to learn how to make them!")
('Agnès', "I think these are supposed to be a bit of a summer<br/>specialty, so I suppose we're terribly out of season.")
('Agnès', "Still, I've been a little interested in this sort of thing<br/>on an artistic level.")
('Risette', "I've heard rumors of this. What an<br/>elegant decoration.")
('Risette', 'I would very much love to hear how a chime made<br/>by my own hand would sound.')
('Aaron', 'Huh. I made paper lanterns for festivals back in<br/>Langport, but I never did wind chimes.')
('Aaron', "Eyes on me, old fart. My master hands'll knock you<br/>on your ass!")
('Quatre', "I don't know Eastern culture very well, but still, I'm<br/>curious to see how these chimes are engineered.")
('Quatre', 'And, of course, these would probably make nice<br/>souvenirs for Gran and Essy.')
('System', 'Spend free time on making wind chimes?')
('System', 'Van and company, with instruction from Tsuruji,<br/>took to making wind chimes like ducks to water,<br/>being careful all the while.')
('System', 'Finally, they finished by painting their wind chimes<br/>as they wished.')
('Van', "That'll do it. Not bad at all, if I do say so myself.")
('Agnès', "I'm glad mine came out well! It was fun to make use<br/>of the techniques I learned in school.")
('Van', "That looks real professional. Lives up to Aramis' rep<br/>for quality.")
('Feri', 'This was fun! It was a lot like some of the stuff we<br/>make back home.')
('Van', "You're pretty dexterous, so I guess it's no shocker<br/>you're a natural.")
('Aaron', 'Looks like I rock this better than you, huh?')
('Van', "Yeah, right. What'd you hew that out with? A<br/>damn pickaxe?")
('Risette', "Hmm... I suppose just having precise data on hand<br/>doesn't cut it. I thought I would end up with a<br/>better result.")
('Van', 'But hey, you had fun. The vibes are the most<br/>important part of this.')
('Quatre', "Maybe I should have altered it by another<br/>few microrege... I think that could've achieved an<br/>even better sound.")
('Van', "Oh, for... It's supposed to be fun, not somethin' you<br/>sweat micro-things over! Just go with the flow and<br/>accept what you get!")
('Yumé', 'Heehee! Look at mine! Did I do a good job?')
('Van', "You bet! Why, it's hard to believe a kid made this.<br/>You did great, Yumes.")
('System', 'After showing each other their wind chimes, they<br/>secured them in gift boxes so they could be given<br/>as souvenirs.')
('Omoro', 'Today...the air of the mountains flows clean and pure.')
('Omoro', 'This clarity would let me read your fortune, if you<br/>would but lend me your palm.')
('Van', '(Palm reading, huh? Not that I believe in it, but they<br/>might get a kick out of it.)')
('Van', '(We did give this a spin already...but hey, vacation<br/>time, right?)')
('Van', "(Wait. I'm with someone who's already done this.<br/>Should I go change up the crew?)")
('System', 'Spend free time to have a palm reading?')
('Yumé', "Huh? For-chun telling? What's that?")
('Yumé', "So the nice lady's gonna look at my palms to see<br/>the future? That sounds fun! I wanna try!")
('Agnès', 'Ahaha... A palm reading feels a little embarrassing...')
('Agnès', 'I have a lot of questions about the future, though.<br/>So, well, why not?')
('Feri', 'Hmm... The clan does fortune telling by<br/>reading flames. I guess this is different?')
('Feri', "I'm kinda curious now! I'd love to have my<br/>palms read!")
('Quatre', "Hmm... I doubt whatever she's going to say has any<br/>scientific basis...")
('Quatre', "...but you don't meet a fortune teller every day, so it<br/>wouldn't hurt to see what she says is in my future.")
('Aaron', 'Man, fortune telling! Back in Langport there was this<br/>lady who used a crystal ball and some other stuff.')
('Aaron', "I don't give a shit about knowing my future or<br/>whatever, but it might be cool to talk about after.")
('Van', 'Wait, uhh... Your hands...')
('Risette', 'Oh, I doubt it will be a problem. My hands are<br/>recreated in quite precise detail.')
('Risette', 'If anything, it should be interesting to see what<br/>results these hands give.')
('Van', "Oh... O-Okay, then?<br/>(I guess she doesn't really think about it?)")
('System', 'Spend free time to have a palm reading?')
('Omoro', "Let me see... Oh, your hand shows what we call the<br/>'cross line.'")
('Omoro', 'Hmm... This is a difficult one. All I can say is...')
('Van', "What's up, ma'am?")
('Omoro', '...The cross line can mean a few things. It can be the<br/>Cross of Secrets, the mark of one who possesses<br/>abnormal powers—or incredible luck.')
('Omoro', 'It may also be the Cross of the Sun, speaking to<br/>artistic talent or yet more meanings. It all depends on<br/>what parts show most strongly... Hmm...')
('Omoro', 'Your cross line... It is odd, for it lies near many signs<br/>yet fades at the last moment, becoming none and<br/>taking a strange middle ground.')
('Van', "(...)<br/>Not sure what all that's about, but thanks, I guess.<br/>Food for thought.")
('Omoro', "Young lady, your hands show the 'destiny line.'<br/>This line speaks of your luck, for weal or woe.")
('Omoro', 'Its direction and branches have many meanings, but it<br/>is easy to mark when you will meet your destiny<br/>with it.')
('Omoro', 'What I can see is that, very soon, you will have an<br/>encounter that will alter your life forever.')
('Agnès', 'That makes sense. I suppose I...do stand at a turning<br/>point right now.')
('Agnès', "Thanks to all the people I've met recently, I've<br/>overcome many trials, too.")
('Agnès', 'I...think I choose to believe that suggests a positive<br/>direction for my future.')
('Omoro', "Child, your hands clearly show the 'growth line.'")
('Omoro', 'Clearly, you are someone who spares no effort in<br/>everything you do.')
('Omoro', 'The growth line... It is a curious one, for I have heard<br/>it can shift even the destiny line at times.')
('Omoro', 'Should your growth bear fruit, it will likely open a<br/>grand future for you.')
('Feri', "R-Really? Does that mean I'll be as good as my<br/>brother, someday?")
('Feri', "Well, then! I'd better work even harder to become a<br/>true warrior worthy of the name!")
('Omoro', "Hmm... Young man, your hands show the<br/>'rebellion line.'")
('Omoro', 'That in itself is not a bad thing. It shows you are<br/>one who holds strong to your own principles. You<br/>rebel against that which you cannot accept.')
('Omoro', 'It is a symbol of those who would force their will<br/>upon the world rather than simply accept the<br/>status quo.')
('Aaron', "...Huh. You're actually the real thing.")
('Aaron', "Looks like I've got official approval from my hands to<br/>keep doing whatever the hell I want!")
('Omoro', "Miss, your...hands have a strong 'work line.'")
('Omoro', "This line doesn't speak of your successes or failures in<br/>your profession, but instead tells of how your work<br/>has changed your life.")
('Omoro', 'I see...that your efforts in work will be the key to<br/>your future.')
('Risette', 'Oh, my. You are quite insightful. It is certainly true<br/>that my life has been changed by my work—in many,<br/>many ways.')
('Risette', 'However... I remain the person I have always been.<br/>I cannot say if I will always be so in the<br/>future, though.')
('Omoro', 'Hmm... Young la... No? Young man?')
('Omoro', "Ahem! Your hands have a clear 'intelligence line'<br/>drawn on them.")
('Omoro', 'As you might think, it speaks to the clarity of<br/>your mind... Its branches, in turn, show the many<br/>talents that might bloom within you.')
('Omoro', 'Your intelligence line is long, and has many branches.<br/>No doubt you will see great success in your<br/>academic pursuits.')
('Quatre', "I'm not quite sure what to make of that confusion at<br/>the start...")
('Quatre', "Thank you regardless, ma'am. I'll take your comments<br/>as an encouragement to study.")
('Omoro', 'Dear child... For such a young girl, you have a<br/>powerful marriage line on you.')
('Omoro', "It won't be soon, of course, but I can see you will be<br/>blessed with a wonderful husband and a happy family.")
('Yumé', 'Yay! That sounds like a happy for-chun for the next<br/>lady of the bistro!')
('Van', '(Sure...if Victor, that lunkhead, ever lets you<br/>get married.)')
('System', 'Afterwards, they had a great time sharing their results<br/>with each other.')
('Tourism Bureau Worker', "This little pond is one of Longlai's hot springs.")
('Tourism Bureau Worker', 'We use this space to make one of the famous treats of<br/>spring towns, hot springs eggs!')
('Van', "(Hmm... Boiling some eggs in the hot springs?<br/>Could be nice. I wouldn't mind a snack.)")
('Van', '(We did give this a spin already...but hey, vacation<br/>time, right?)')
('Van', "(Wait. I'm with someone who's already done this.<br/>Should I go change up the crew?)")
('System', 'Spend free time to make some hot springs eggs?')
('Feri', 'You can use hot springs to cook stuff? Neat!')
('Feri', 'This seems like it could be great survival training!')
('Agnès', 'Hot springs eggs? I think I saw a stand selling some,<br/>come to think of it.')
('Agnès', "Still, I bet it'll be even tastier if we make<br/>them ourselves.")
('Aaron', "Oh, hey! I love boiled eggs. Had them all the time<br/>back in Langport. Goes great with pork belly. If you<br/>simmer it just right, it's like heaven.")
('Aaron', "Not sure how different they'll taste if you boil them in<br/>a hot spring, but hey, if they taste good, I'm not<br/>gonna complain.")
('Quatre', 'Using the heated water of a hot spring to boil<br/>an egg...')
('Quatre', "Aha! That's a very clever use of geothermal energy,<br/>and if it's lightly sulfuric... I'm quite interested in this<br/>cultural phenomenon.")
('Risette', "Hmm... I've heard of hot springs eggs, but I have<br/>never made one myself.")
('Risette', 'But as they say, everything is worth a try once.<br/>I would be glad to have the experience.')
('Yumé', "Ooh! I'm good at boiled eggs! Mommy taught me<br/>how to make them!")
('Yumé', 'I bet I could make a real gour-may hot springs egg!')
('System', 'Spend free time to make some hot springs eggs?')
('System', 'Van and company were given a simple explanation by<br/>the staff...')
('System', 'They then took to boiling their eggs, each of them<br/>cooking them in different heat and for differing times<br/>as they saw fit.')
('Van', 'Man, I used to make these a lot when I trained here.<br/>Good to see I still got it.')
('Van', "Now, if you want these to taste real good, you put<br/>some syrup on 'em. That's a flavor to die for.")
('Agnès', "Hmm... Mine ended up a little harder than I'd<br/>have liked.")
('Agnès', "That's a bit embarrassing. Not quite the same as<br/>baking confections, I suppose.")
('Van', "Yeah. It's a little different than, say, bakin' some<br/>cookies in an oven.")
('Van', "It's more like...meltin' chocolate. You gotta handle it<br/>real delicate—")
('Agnès', 'I think I see why yours came out so well, Van.')
('Feri', "Aww. These are, like, hot springs sorta-warmed eggs.<br/>I should've boiled them for longer.")
('Van', "Yeah, I noticed it seemed like you just put 'em in and<br/>pulled them right back out.")
('Van', "Why'd you go with that?")
('Feri', 'Well, you see, I cooked meat using a geyser we found<br/>during a march through the mountains this one time.')
('Feri', 'I think I just tried to cook it like I did with the geyser.')
('Van', "Hah! Yeah, Longlai's hot springs ARE hot, but that's<br/>lukewarm compared to a freakin' geyser.")
('Van', "These aren't so bad though, yeah?")
('Van', "Yours came out pretty rocklike, huh? You left 'em in<br/>the water for way too long.")
('Aaron', "Please! They're hard boiled! Just like a real man.")
('Aaron', "Besides, this is about what you want if you're gonna<br/>pair them with some nice, Langport-flavored<br/>pork belly.")
('Van', "Hey, you do you. I dunno if they've got the spices for<br/>Langport flavor here, though.")
('Risette', 'Hmm... They came out a touch undercooked. This is<br/>more difficult than it seems.')
('Van', "Yeah. Hot springs egg cookin' is about experience<br/>and intuition. Normal skills need not apply, y'know?")
('Risette', 'I see what you mean, but it was still very fun. Before I<br/>do it again, I should get my thermographic<br/>sensor upgraded...')
('Van', 'Uhh... Think we can leave crazy super-tech at home.')
('Van', 'Well, well. Yours came out pretty good, huh?')
('Van', 'Lemme guess! You calculated the precise boiling time<br/>based on thermodynamic transfer across...something<br/>or other?')
('Quatre', 'Haha! Actually, Gran and Essy made sure I knew<br/>how to cook.')
('Quatre', 'I hope we can come here together and I can treat<br/>them to some eggs next time... Especially if Yang can<br/>join us.')
('Yumé', "How are mine, Van? I bet they're really yummy!")
('Van', 'Yeah, they sure are real good.')
('Van', "Looks like you've inherited Victor's skills some, huh?")
('Yumé', "Heh heh heh! Yep, I'm pretty good!")
('Yumé', "I can make breakfast for you sometime if you'd<br/>like, Van!")
('Van', 'Oh, yeah? Looking forward to it!')
('System', 'And so they had a pleasant time sharing their hot<br/>springs eggs with each other.')
('Priest Izumi', 'Our temple has a unique service you might not find in<br/>other regions: Eastern tea is free for visitors.')
('Priest Izumi', 'Preparing tea and providing it to your guests is a<br/>ritual with many meanings far to the East.')
('Priest Izumi', 'If you have the time, would you like to experience<br/>some Longlai tea, made with local tea leaves and<br/>local water?')
('Van', "(Well, couldn't hurt to do things the Longlai way.)")
('Van', '(We did give this a spin already...but hey, vacation<br/>time, right?)')
('Van', "(Wait. I'm with someone who's already done this.<br/>Should I go change up the crew?)")
('System', 'Spend free time to have some Longlai tea?')
('Aaron', "Pfft! Talk about a good time...for old people.<br/>Still, sure—let's see how good that tea is.")
('Feri', "The flavor of Longlai tea! I can't even imagine what<br/>it's like.")
('Agnès', "Oh, I've heard of that tea. I've never had it before,<br/>of course. I'm curious!")
('Risette', 'Oh, my. Afternoon tea, is it?')
('Yumé', "I'd rather have some juice...but okay! I'll try to<br/>drink it!")
('Quatre', "It shouldn't be much different from black or green<br/>tea...right?")
('System', 'Spend free time to have some Longlai tea?')
('System', "Having accepted, Van and company marveled at<br/>Izumi's tea artistry...")
('System', '...and once the tea was served, they took to<br/>drinking it.')
('Van', 'Ahh...')
('Van', "Man. It's been forever since I had Longlai tea.<br/>It's just seepin' into me.")
('Van', "It's stuff like this that makes you see how tea culture<br/>became so important for things like welcoming<br/>guests—and even mental trainin'.")
('Agnès', 'Oh, wow! This is so calming. I feel so much more<br/>relaxed now.')
('Agnès', '(...Back when I was little, I remember spending days<br/>with my family like this... I miss those days.)')
('Van', 'Glad to see you like it.')
('Agnès', "It's wonderful, thank you.")
('Feri', 'Hmm... This scent carries the breath of the natural<br/>world in it.')
('Feri', 'I bet it would be super fun to do something like this<br/>with my clan!')
('Van', "Well, that's what they say about culture: it spreads,<br/>mixes, and advances in the doin'.")
('Aaron', "Oh, man! I take back that thing about this being for<br/>old people. It's actually real good—especially with<br/>the snacks.")
('Aaron', "I've always been an oolong kinda guy, but this<br/>Longlai tea is worth a drink, too.")
('Van', "Heh. Well, I'm glad it's earned your approval.")
('Risette', 'The flavor is warm and gentle, one that seeps into<br/>the drinker. It feels as if it is spreading into the very<br/>depths of my senses...')
('Risette', "I hadn't considered it before now, but I haven't had<br/>the time for relaxing tea like this in a long while.")
('Van', 'Yeah, you work hard. Which is good all on its own,<br/>but it also means you deserve all the rest you can get.')
('Quatre', "That tea ceremony was an incredible show!<br/>Precisely choreographed, calculated down to the tea's<br/>target temperature...")
('Quatre', 'A perfect fusion of artistry and logic. Eastern culture<br/>has so much depth to it.')
('Van', "I'm sure you've got a lotta exciting finds ahead of you<br/>as you discover more of it.")
('Yumé', "Mmm... Tea's kinda bitter. But the more I drink it,<br/>the more I like it!")
('Yumé', 'I know grandpa drinks tea sometimes, so it must<br/>be good!')
('Van', 'Heh. It takes a pretty smart cookie to be able to<br/>appreciate tea, Yumes.')
('System', 'And so Van and company spent a relaxing time<br/>enjoying and talking over tea.')
('Kukai', 'Fishing is something one can attain mastery of, too.<br/>To become one with the mountains, to read the flow<br/>of the rivers...')
('Van', "(What's with this old guy? Guess he's a fisherman?)")
('Kukai', 'Hmm? You there, sir. You seem interested in fishing.<br/>No need to restrain yourself! Come! Free yourself and<br/>embrace fishing with me!')
('Kukai', "I am Kukai, a master of fishing in the East!<br/>I'm holding a bit of a fishing competition.")
('Kukai', 'I hoped to convey the true mystery of fishing to the<br/>people of this land while I am here.')
('Van', 'Oh, yeah?')
('Kukai', 'Well, this is the season for dragon trout. And so I<br/>chose to make the most of it while the time was<br/>on us.')
('Kukai', 'Of course, no early registration required.<br/>Competition is both the joy and the source of<br/>self-improvement in fishing.')
('Kukai', 'Would you like to join the fishing competition?<br/>Now is the best season to catch dragon trout!')
('Kukai', 'Of course, no early registration required.<br/>Competition is both the joy and the source of<br/>self-improvement in fishing.')
('Van', "(As I recall, that's a common fish around Longlai.<br/>Didn't plan on a fishin' trip, but it's a valid tack.)")
('Van', '(We did give this a spin already...but hey, vacation<br/>time, right?)')
('Van', "(Wait. I'm with someone who's already done this.<br/>Should I go change up the crew?)")
('System', 'Spend free time to join the fishing competition?')
('Risette', 'A fishing competition we just happened to be in<br/>time for? What a curious form of serendipity.')
('Aaron', "Fine by me! If we're gonna do this, I'll get the biggest<br/>fish of any of us!")
('Feri', "Oh, just you wait! I'll show you the mighty fishing<br/>powers of the Warriors of Kruga!")
('Agnès', "The water is so clear and clean. I'm sure you can catch<br/>a lot here.")
('Quatre', "I'm more the indoor type. Still, it can't hurt to go out<br/>of my comfort zone once in a while.")
('Yumé', "Wow, fishing! I've never done this before. Just watch!<br/>I'm gonna fish up dinner tonight!")
('Van', "No, Yumé, you get to watch this time. Don't want<br/>you slippin' into the river, 'specially in this season.")
('Van', "Don't worry. I'll catch a big fish for the both of us, so<br/>you're on my team, got it?")
('Yumé', 'Oh, okay! You go get the fish, Van!')
('System', 'Spend free time to join the fishing competition?')
('System', 'So, Van and company joined the fishing competition<br/>just to enjoy the fishing...')
('System', 'Though they did compare the fish they managed<br/>to catch.')
('Van', "Ahh, that's a pretty big one.")
('Yumé', "Wow, Van! That's great!")
('Yumé', "Bet'cha couldn't do it without me helping, huh?")
('Van', "You know it, Yumes. Would've been hopeless<br/>without you.")
('Kukai', "Oh, my! That is a very impressive dragon trout!<br/>I didn't think you had it in you to pull up one<br/>that big.")
('Kukai', "You're quite skilled. Have you considered taking up<br/>the rod professionally?")
('Van', "Nah, I'm good. I only fish as a hobby sometimes.")
('Van', "Still, it's a good hobby to have.")
('Van', 'Great, got another big one.')
('Yumé', "Wow, Van! That's great!")
('Yumé', "Bet'cha couldn't do it without me helping, huh?")
('Van', "You know it, Yumes. Would've been hopeless<br/>without you.")
('Kukai', 'Amazing. To catch such large fish, and not<br/>just once...')
('Kukai', "You truly have talent for fishing. Are you sure you<br/>don't want to fish professionally?")
('Van', "I told you, I'm not gonna get serious about it.")
('Van', "Hey, that's a pretty good one—'specially considering<br/>your level of experience.")
('Van', 'If you can already catch fish like this, you can<br/>probably get pretty good.')
('Agnès', "I still don't feel terribly confident, but I do feel like<br/>I've learned something thanks to you, Van.")
('Agnès', 'I guess even I can manage to catch fish like these with<br/>reasonable ease.')
('Van', "Heh. Gettin' pretty handy at this, huh?")
('Feri', 'Agh... I was hoping to catch a real big one.')
('Van', "Hey, no use sweatin' the one that got away. At least<br/>you're not emptyhanded, yeah?")
('Feri', "Sure, but it means I lose the competition, and losing<br/>is lame! Let's do it again, Van!")
('Van', 'Hey, look at that—you did totally okay-ish. Not as<br/>big as the one I fished up, of course.')
('Aaron', "Already blind as a bat, eh? Mine's WAY bigger<br/>than yours.")
('Van', 'Pfft. Just admit you lost.')
('Aaron', 'You wanna piece of this?!')
('Kukai', '(Like two peas in a pod.)')
('Van', 'Well, hell. You got a pretty big one, too, huh?')
('Risette', 'Indeed. I attempted to fish in a fitting manner<br/>suggested by the aggregate data reported of the area.')
('Risette', "With that said, the sensation of the fish tugging the<br/>moment it lands on the hook is as thrilling an<br/>experience as I'd heard.")
('Van', "Good to hear you liked it. Just don't go turnin' into a<br/>hardcore fishmonger on me, yeah?")
('Quatre', 'Hmm... Not much of a catch, is it?')
('Van', "Hey, it's fine. Fishin' ain't just about landing the<br/>biggest lunker.")
('Quatre', '...You know, somehow hearing that makes it all the<br/>more frustrating.')
('Quatre', "Next time, I'll use FIO's active sonar to locate the fish<br/>habitats in advance so I can—")
('Van', "At that point you're straight-up cheatin'.")
('System', 'And so they spent a bit more time wetting their lines,<br/>enjoying the peaceful moments fishing.')
('Bracer Kazan', "So he's still not back?")
('Bracer Kazan', "That's bad. A newbie like him out alone in this<br/>situation...?")
('Receptionist Drusilla', "Enough. Why weren't you keeping an eye on<br/>him, Kazan?")
('Receptionist Drusilla', "I'm sure you must have realized that he...")
('Bracer Kazan', "I-I get it! I'll go out looking for him in a bit.")
('Bracer Kazan', 'But what bad timing. Especially as we kept an eye on<br/>the Kunlun Mountains and the eastern highway...')
('Receptionist Drusilla', 'Rather than complaining, may I suggest you get back<br/>to work?')
('Bracer Kazan', "Yeah, yeah, I'm going.")
('Van', "(Looks like they're busy. Searchin' for someone,<br/>I guess?)")
('Van', "(Though hang on—that stupid-serious newbie's<br/>not here.)")
('Van', '(Hey, wait. Over there.)')
('Van', "(That junior bracer was supposed to be travelin'<br/>between the branches as part of his training, right?)")
('Van', "(Guessin' he's the one they were talkin' about at<br/>the guild...)")
('Van', "(One way or another, it's not a night to be out on the<br/>mountains alone. Should I follow him just in case?)")
('Van', '(I saw that junior bracer not too long ago.)')
('Van', '(Should I follow him just in case?)')
('Van', "Well, I'm not eager to stick my nose into<br/>guild business.")
('Van', "I've run into him back in Edith a few times, though,<br/>so it's not like he's a stranger. I'd feel bad if<br/>something happened to him.")
('Van', "Best case scenario, I can get the guild to owe me one.<br/>Let's go check up on him.")
('Van', "That said, even if I'm gonna follow him, I should<br/>make sure I'm ready for anything.")
('Van', "'Sides, this is the guild's problem. I can just see how it<br/>develops for now.")
('System', 'Quest Finding Gray started!')
('Bracer Gray', "So I caused a lot of trouble for all of you, didn't I?")
('Bracer Gray', "I-I'm prepared to accept whatever responsibility you<br/>require of me...")
('Bracer Kazan', "Enough. Don't want to hear any more of that—we<br/>want to know why you did it.")
('Bracer Kazan', "I get that you have to get strong, and I've seen you<br/>working at it...")
('Bracer Kazan', '...but charging into the mountains at this hour to<br/>fight every single monster you meet is insane.')
('Bracer Kazan', "What's driving you so damn hard?")
('Van', "You're Gray, right? Seen you around Edith a<br/>few times.")
('Van', 'As far as I understand, people think pretty highly<br/>of you. You got a bright future.')
('Van', "Do you think the Immovable, Hazel, and Elaine ain't<br/>gonna worry about you doin' stuff like this?")
('Bracer Kazan', "I see that you've got some things going on. Not that<br/>having a complicated history is rare in the<br/>bracer business.")
('Bracer Kazan', "But you have to realize that it's time to man up and<br/>talk it out, all right?")
('Bracer Kazan', 'Who knows? Maybe we can even help.')
('Bracer Gray', "...I'm not from Calvard. I'm originally from<br/>Leman State.")
('Bracer Kazan', "Whoa, wait. So you... You're a junior bracer, though.<br/>Does the Leman branch send their newbies out to<br/>train in foreign countries?")
('Bracer Kazan', 'Even I did my early training back home in the East.')
('Van', "Leman's the HQ of the entire Bracer Guild, but I've<br/>never heard of them sending pure newbies out of the<br/>country to train.")
('Van', "If I had to guess, the folks at headquarters don't know<br/>about this.")
('Bracer Gray', "...I know I've caused trouble for all of you. But I really<br/>can't say any more.")
('Bracer Gray', "When the time comes...I'll tell everyone—even the<br/>people back at the head branch in Edith. For now,<br/>please, don't tell anyone!")
('Receptionist Drusilla', 'I see... Hmm...')
('Van', 'You know anything about this, Drusilla?')
('Receptionist Drusilla', "Nothing specific. But let's say my imagination<br/>is healthy.")
('Receptionist Drusilla', "Either way, I think it's all going to come down to the<br/>path you walk, and your determination to walk it.")
('Receptionist Drusilla', 'Gray... Gray Arnold.')
('Bracer Gray', '...')
('Bracer Kazan', 'Huh?')
('Van', "(Hmm... There's somethin' I'm missin' here, but I'll<br/>just file this away for now.)")
('Receptionist Drusilla', "Well, I think we've said enough for tonight.")
('Receptionist Drusilla', 'The guild will pay for your time, Arkride.')
('Bracer Gray', 'No! I should be the one to pay—')
('Bracer Kazan', "Shut it, newbie. You've got a long way to go before<br/>you get to have an opinion on Drusilla's decisions.")
('Van', "Works for me. I wasn't happy about taking mira from<br/>a newbie bracer, anyway.")
('Van', "Anyway, buddy, make sure you try to learn from<br/>tonight's events, yeah?")
('Bracer Gray', "I'm very sorry...")
('Bracer Gray', 'Thank you very much, all of you.')
('System', 'Quest Finding Gray completed!')
('System', 'Received')
