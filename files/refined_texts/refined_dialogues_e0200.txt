('Van', "Hah! I'll teach ya to look down on my baby!")
('Van', 'Eat my dust!')
('Maxim', "Can't corner at that speed, rookie!")
('Van', "I've got two little helpers that beg to differ!")
('Van', 'Yeah!')
('Van', 'Hold on!')
('Maxim', 'How the hell...?!')
('Maxim', 'I see... Their weight stabilized his turn!')
('Van', 'Eyes on the road, champ!')
('Van', "Let's go!")
('Van', 'That was close...')
('Van', "Comin' through!")
('Maxim', 'What?!')
('Van', "Still stuck back there? Don't think he'd try<br/>off-roading in a sports car.")
('Van', "Lame. Didn't think he'd give up so easy.")
('Van', "You're kidding me!")
('Maxim', 'Miss me?')
('Van', 'Crazy bastard weaved between the buses!')
('System', 'Earned')
('Maxim', 'Putting up more of a fight than I expected.')
('Maxim', 'But your fate was sealed the moment you decided to<br/>cross the great Maxim Lugan!')
('Van', "Guess he ain't a pro for nothing.")
('Van', 'Time to bust out my ace in the hole!')
('Maxim', 'Is that a turbocharger?! Those things are brand new!')
('Maxim', "Haha! This is getting interesting! I'll just have to—!")
('Maxim', '...?!')
('Van', 'Shit!')
('Maxim', '...Are the foxes all right?')
('Feri', 'It looks like they got away safely.')
('Agnès', "I suppose monsters aren't the only creatures that<br/>cause accidents...")
('Agnès', "Let's hope they've learned their lesson to stay off<br/>the road.")
('Maxim', 'Right...')
('Van', 'Tough break, huh?')
('Maxim', "Hmph. I don't need your pity. You and your<br/>Ingert won.")
('Van', 'Come on now—')
('Maxim', "When a car goes off course, the driver bears<br/>the responsibility. That's the rule.")
('Maxim', "You all can go. The engine's fine, and I can handle<br/>her basic repairs myself.")
('Van', 'If anything comes up, give me a call.')
('Agnès', 'I feel kind of sorry for him...')
('Feri', "Me, too. I didn't think he'd accept defeat like that.")
('Van', 'Stuff like that is what makes you a champ.')
('Van', "Heh. Maybe he's got some good in him after all.")
('Van', 'After all that racing, we should get into Langport<br/>on time.')
('Walter the Direwolf', "Nice job keepin' pace...")
('Walter the Direwolf', '...but the real match starts here!')
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Try not to eat pavement on this turn.')
('Hermès', 'How about you try not to eat my dust?')
('Walter the Direwolf', "Man, she's jacking up her speed before a corner<br/>like this? That takes balls!")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Man, she's not slowin' down even before a corner<br/>like this? That takes balls!")
('Aaron', 'She sped up THERE?!')
('Van', "Lady's got one crazy sense of balance, don't she?")
('Junifer', 'That was amazing! It takes real skills and an amazing<br/>bike to pull that off.')
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Hahaha! Not bad!')
('Hermès', 'Hyaaa!')
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Bah. Lost by the skin of my teeth.')
('Hermès', 'Phew... That was a close one.')
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Hahaha! Not bad!')
('Hermès', 'Hyaaa!')
('Walter the Direwolf', '*pant* That was down to the wire.')
('Hermès', 'Tch. And I was so close, too...')
('Hermès', 'Now!')
