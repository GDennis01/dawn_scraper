('System', 'Viola is unconscious.')
('System', 'Olympia is unconscious.')
('System', 'Alexandre is unconscious.')
('Judith', "It's so pretty...")
('Feri', 'So this is what it looks like from the inside.')
('Quatre', "We must be in a dimension that's separate from<br/>our reality.")
('Risette', "This area appears to be free of<br/>Pandemonium's influence.")
('Bergard', 'But it still has a firm grip on our world. This tower is<br/>responsible for creating Pandemonium—and<br/>maintaining it.')
('Aaron', 'All the more reason to climb to the top and tear this<br/>place down.')
('Van', 'Ugh...')
('Agnès', 'Van!')
('Feri', "Wh-What's wrong? Are you hurt?!")
('Van', "I'm fine. This is just a sign that we're closin' in on the<br/>root issue of this whole thing.")
('Quatre', '...')
('Aaron', 'Hmph.')
('Risette', '...')
('Judith', "You're being so vague. Can't you just fill us in on<br/>what we're missing?")
('Van', "Sorry, but doin' that would just muddy the waters.")
('Van', "There's only one thing you need to know: the cause of<br/>all our problems—and the truth behind what's<br/>happening—is waitin' for us up above.")
('Van', 'And I gotta get there—no matter what it takes.')
('Van', "But I realize I can't do that alone. So please...give me<br/>a hand.")
('Feri', '...')
('Aaron', 'Did you just ask us for OUR help?')
('Bergard', '...')
('Judith', 'Our debt-obsessed leader is pleading for our aid?<br/>Hah! Hell must be freezing over.')
('Quatre', "For real. You're finally letting us repay what we<br/>owe you. I truly never thought I'd see the day.")
('Feri', "I didn't, either. It makes me so happy.")
('Risette', 'Me as well. I was beginning to believe I would never<br/>hear those words from you.')
('Aaron', "Too bad they come at a hefty price. You're gonna<br/>have to pay us back a thousand times over.")
('Van', "You little...! Heh. Fine. But I ain't settlin' for any<br/>more than double.")
('Bergard', 'Heheh.')
('Agnès', "Don't worry. We're not asking for anything in return.<br/>...But we do have one condition:")
('Agnès', 'We will give you a hand IF you let us help you the<br/>entire way through.')
('Agnès', 'You have many wonderful friends in your corner and<br/>powerful allies to call on...')
('Agnès', "...but you often throw caution to the wind all<br/>the same. Can you promise us that you won't do that<br/>this time?")
('Van', '...')
('Van', "Okay. It's a promise.")
('Van', "But I want you all to remember that we ain't heroes<br/>of justice. There's no shame in turnin' tail if things go<br/>to shit.")
('Van', "The fate of the world's important and all, but our lives<br/>are, too. We ain't gonna throw 'em away.")
('Van', "Know your limits, and don't worry about what's black<br/>or white. That's the spriggan creed, and we're gonna<br/>follow it like always.")
('Van', "So here's the plan: we're gonna kick Almata and the<br/>Gardens' sorry asses.")
('Van', "They may be back with a vengeance, but we've beaten<br/>'em all once. We can do it again.")
('Van', "After that, we're gonna settle the score with Melchior<br/>and Dantès—once and for all!")
('Agnès', 'Right!')
('System', 'Elaine left the party.')
('Viola', "Why, hello there. We've been expecting you all.")
('Olympia', 'Fate truly does take pleasure in bringing us together.')
('Van', "You're tellin' me. She's a cruel mistress for it.")
('Aaron', "I'll say. Can't believe you both are back from<br/>the dead.")
('Aaron', "I'll say. Can't believe the sadist's back from the dead.")
('Aaron', "I'll say. Can't believe the angel chick's back from<br/>the dead.")
('Aaron', "I'll say. I thought the CID had you both under lock<br/>and key.")
('Agnès', 'Is the seventh Genesis responsible for bringing<br/>them here?')
('Agnès', 'The seventh Genesis had to have been responsible for<br/>that, right?')
('Risette', 'I can see no other explanation. It must have been<br/>used in the realization of Pandemonium.')
('Viola', "Yeah, probably. One minute, we're dead, and the<br/>next, we're in front of the boss and Melchior.")
('Viola', "I very much doubt I'm back for good, though.<br/>My existence here is likely temporary.")
('Olympia', 'Still, if the entire world is engulfed in Pandemonium,<br/>then the lies will become the truth.')
('Olympia', 'My life was hollow from beginning to end—so this<br/>may be my only chance to make a new start.')
('Viola', "Yeah, probably. One minute, we're dead, and the<br/>next, we're in front of the boss and Melchior.")
('Viola', "I very much doubt I'm back for good, though.<br/>My existence here is likely temporary.")
('Olympia', 'As for me, I was content with sitting in my cell, but I<br/>was whisked away regardless...')
('Olympia', 'I have no personal interest or emotional involvement<br/>in the realization of Pandemonium, but I will do as I<br/>am told.')
('Viola', "Yeah, probably. One minute, I was sitting in my cell,<br/>the next, I'm enjoying the sweet taste of freedom.")
('Viola', "I guess fortune's finally smiling upon me. A little late,<br/>perhaps, but I'll take it.")
('Olympia', 'Still, if the entire world is engulfed in Pandemonium,<br/>then the lies will become the truth.')
('Olympia', 'My life was hollow from beginning to end—so this<br/>may be my only chance to make a new start.')
('Viola', "Yeah, probably. One minute, we were locked away,<br/>and the next, we weren't.")
('Viola', "I guess fortune's finally smiling upon me. A little late,<br/>perhaps, but I'll take it.")
('Olympia', 'I could not care less what happens to me either way.')
('Olympia', 'I have no personal interest or emotional involvement<br/>in the realization of Pandemonium, but I will do as I<br/>am told.')
('Judith', "Welp. Guess we're getting right down to<br/>business, then!")
('Feri', "If you're going to stand in our way, then we'll just<br/>have to force our way through!")
('Viola', "Heh. I look forward to seeing you try, little girl, but<br/>I'm MUCH more excited to see all of your bloody<br/>corpses sprawled out on the floor.")
('Viola', "And that will happen sooner than you think because<br/>with this new power, I can't lose!")
('Viola', 'I believe that to be a fitting punishment for sending<br/>me to rot in that cell!')
('Olympia', 'Ishtanti, activate Dies Irae mode.')
('Olympia', 'You shall be embraced by wings of mercy and laid to<br/>eternal rest in a garden of gold.')
('Quatre', 'Here we go!')
('Bergard', 'Be wary of the distance between yourselves and them!')
('Van', "You ain't puttin' us to sleep, angel girl. You're the<br/>one's who'll be enjoyin' a nice, long nap!")
('Olympia', "Ishtanti's output is decreasing...")
('Olympia', "I don't understand. There is this emotion that's<br/>welling up from inside me. I think it's...frustration?")
('Agnès', 'Really?')
('Risette', "I'm glad you were able to recover that emotion.")
('Risette', "Rest well. I pray that you will be at the Goddess' side<br/>when next you wake.")
('Agnès', 'Really?')
('Risette', "I'm glad you were able to recover that emotion.")
('Risette', 'Rest well. I sincerely hope that, one day, you can<br/>begin to take even more steps forward.')
('Olympia', "Haha... The probability of that is close to zero,<br/>I'm afraid.")
('Olympia', '...I have to go now. Farewell, everyone. And...thank<br/>you, Risette.')
('Olympia', "Haha. That's wishful thinking, I'm afraid. I cannot<br/>imagine that day will ever come.")
('Olympia', "Regardless, I will accept my defeat with grace.<br/>It's time I return to my shackles and live out<br/>my sentence.")
('Viola', "*sigh* It's a pity that she only regained some of her<br/>humanity at the end. She was even a little charming.")
('Viola', "*sigh* It's a pity that she only regained some of her<br/>humanity at the end. She was even a little charming.")
('Viola', 'Well, this is it. My time in this world is up.')
('Viola', "Well, this is it. It's about time I return to my cell.")
('Viola', "Frankly, I don't give a rat's ass about Melchior, but do<br/>take care of the boss for me, if you would.")
('Viola', 'Consider that a request—from me to you.')
('Feri', 'What?')
('Quatre', "You're...actually giving us a request?")
('Van', "That ain't necessary. I was planning on doin'<br/>that anyway.")
('Van', "I can guarantee that I'll get the job done, though.<br/>Least I can do for someone who's on their way out.")
('Van', "But if you surrender yourself to judgment willingly,<br/>I'll give you my full guarantee that I'll get the<br/>job done.")
('Viola', "Heh. That's good enough for me, I suppose.")
('Viola', 'Looking back, I led a shitty life—from start to finish.<br/>At least I had some fun at the end.')
('Viola', "Heheh. Not like I'm in a position to refuse.")
('Viola', "Well, I can settle for that, I suppose. You watch<br/>your back while you're fighting him.")
('Aaron', "Ugh. She didn't deserve the luxury of a peaceful death<br/>after all she did.")
('Aaron', 'Ugh. Where does she get off, ordering us around?<br/>She has no right to be making demands.')
('Feri', 'Aaron...')
('Agnès', 'Still, it does feel like our words reached her in<br/>the end.')
('Judith', "True. Though that's not going to wipe away all the<br/>wrongs she's done.")
('Judith', 'More importantly, what was up with her<br/>request, Van?')
('Van', "Well, obviously it's about Dantès. He's up<br/>to somethin'...")
('Van', "...and I'm pretty sure I know what. It's stuff that...I<br/>was indirectly involved in at one point.")
('Van', "Let's leave it at that for now. I think the rest'll<br/>become clear soon enough.")
('Judith', '...All right.')
('Quatre', "We should move on. There's still a lot of tower left<br/>to climb.")
('Feri', 'Right!')
('Agnès', 'Oh, but before we move on, what should we do<br/>with her?')
('Agnès', 'Oh, but before we move on, what should we do<br/>with them?')
('Bergard', 'I believe restraint is necessary, at the very least.')
('Arioch', "'Sup. Glad you could make it.")
('Alexandre', "If you're here, then I can only assume Viola and<br/>Olympia have fallen.")
('Van', 'Well, this is just great. Do we really gotta deal with<br/>both of you at the same time?')
('Aaron', 'So the old tin can and the soldier got revived, huh?')
('Aaron', 'So the old tin can got revived, and the soldier<br/>busted out of prison.')
('Alexandre', 'Yes. Much like Viola, I was summoned back to this<br/>world from Gehenna. And quite forcefully, at that.')
('Alexandre', 'Yes. Unlike Viola, I was summoned back to this<br/>world from Gehenna. And quite forcefully, at that.')
('Alexandre', 'Yes. Unlike Viola, I was brought here from my cell by<br/>forces beyond my control.')
('Alexandre', 'Yes. Much like Viola, I was brought here from my<br/>cell by forces beyond my control.')
('Alexandre', 'Be that as it may, I have been given another chance to<br/>achieve glory on the battlefield. And I shall do so—by<br/>claiming your lives.')
('Quatre', "I suppose they aren't in a chatty mood.")
('Feri', "Nope. Though it's not like we'd be able to talk them<br/>down anyway.")
('Arioch', 'You got that right, kiddo.')
('Arioch', "Thanks to the Fangs of Rahu, I lived waaay longer<br/>than any human should've. I was ready to accept the<br/>sweet kiss of death by the end of my run.")
('Arioch', "But that don't mean I hafta pass up one last shot at<br/>severin' heads.")
('Alexandre', 'I, too, have long considered myself a walking corpse.')
('Alexandre', 'I hoped that my defeat in the former capital would<br/>enlighten me to a new way of life, but alas, it did not.')
('Alexandre', "I'm sorry, but I must ask that you indulge my<br/>selfishness once more. Show me your strength!")
('Aaron', "Someone's eager for an ass-kicking. And I'm always<br/>happy to serve.")
('Judith', "Same here. I'm not about to lose to a<br/>death-happy scumbag!")
('Judith', "I've also got an overly eager fan here who's strayed<br/>from the light—and it's up to me to set him straight!")
('Arioch', "Heheheh. Good to see that fiery spirit hasn't faded<br/>one bit. Bring it on, lady!")
('Risette', 'The two of them excel in both physical strength<br/>and agility. They are formidable opponents, indeed!')
('Van', "Maybe, but we'll take 'em down all the same!<br/>Both the front and back lines are gonna have to pull<br/>their weight on this one!")
('Van', "We'll be countin' on your support, too, Master!")
('Agnès', "I'll do my best!")
('Bergard', 'And I will do the same!')
('Agnès', '...')
('Aaron', '...')
('Alexandre', 'Heh. I do apologize for forcing this burden on you<br/>twice, Aaron Wei.')
('Alexandre', 'Go ahead. Exact your revenge. Free yourself from the<br/>hatred that has consumed you for so long.')
('Aaron', "Nah, I'm good. You've got a whole lot more to<br/>answer for than what you did to my bros. I mean, you<br/>guys blew up an entire village.")
('Aaron', "Plus I know the stuff in Langport wasn't your<br/>decision alone. Honestly, my whole 'revenge' bit<br/>kinda lost steam a while ago.")
('Alexandre', "I'm...surprised to hear that. Your self-restraint<br/>is commendable. If only the young people<br/>back home...")
('Alexandre', "No. That doesn't matter anymore.")
('Aaron', '...')
('Alexandre', 'Heh. Perhaps this is as good a chance as any,<br/>Aaron Wei.')
('Alexandre', 'Go ahead. Exact your revenge. Free yourself from the<br/>hatred that has consumed you for so long.')
('Aaron', "Nah, I'm good. You've got a whole lot more to<br/>answer for than what you did to my bros. I mean, you<br/>guys blew up an entire village.")
('Aaron', "I'd rather you reflect on your actions and pay your<br/>dues—by sitting your ass in jail.")
('Alexandre', "I'm...surprised to hear that. Your self-restraint<br/>is commendable. If only the young people<br/>back home...")
('Alexandre', "Heh. No, I'm sure they don't need that.")
('Arioch', "He was the last bodyguard of a prince, yeah?<br/>Guess the two of us weren't all that different.")
('Arioch', "He found his peace way sooner than I did, though.<br/>I'm happy for the guy.")
('Arioch', "Well, then. I think it's about time for me to mosey on<br/>over to the great beyond.")
('Arioch', "Though his home's still rebuildin' itself, and if he's<br/>lucky, the guy can rebuild his future right alongside it.")
('Arioch', "Well, then. I think it's about time for me to mosey on<br/>over to the great beyond.")
('Van', "I'll be real with you. I was dreadin' the rematch with<br/>you more than anyone else.")
('Van', "Your halberd's a force to be reckoned with, and<br/>you've had a long-ass time to train.")
('Judith', 'By the way, did you actually go to see one of<br/>my films?')
('Arioch', 'Hell yeah, I did. I caught a showing of Golden Blood<br/>back in Oración.')
('Arioch', 'It was a wild ride from start to finish. Had a pretty<br/>damn good leading lady, too. Loved every minute.')
('Arioch', "Never liked havin' such a long lease on life, but seein'<br/>that might've made living all these long, unnecessary<br/>years worth it in the end.")
('Judith', "There are so many good movies out there. And I'm<br/>not just talking about the ones I'm in.")
('Judith', 'I hope you can see more of them someday.')
('Agnès', 'Judith...')
('Quatre', 'He seemed...oddly satisfied.')
('Feri', 'Yeah. It caught me off guard, to be honest.')
('Van', "The guy may've been cruel to the bone...")
('Van', '...but I guess he had a bit of human in him after all.')
('Judith', 'Yeah. I know he did.')
('Bergard', 'Both had their share of differences, but they were<br/>warriors through and through.')
('Bergard', 'The fact that you all defeated both of them at once<br/>speaks volumes about your growth.')
('Aaron', 'Heh. Sure hope so.')
('Risette', 'Hopefully that means we will also do well against our<br/>final two opponents.')
('Van', "Yeah, but we gotta be careful. We might've fought<br/>Melchior before, but the guy's a wild card. No idea<br/>what tricks he has up his sleeve.")
('Van', "Then there's the big, bad boss man. The guy cheated<br/>death itself, so heaven only knows what he's<br/>capable of.")
('Van', "We may've crossed some huge hurdles to get this far,<br/>but don't let up. The real fight's still yet to come.")
('Van', "Let's give this all we've got, everyone.")
('Feri', 'Right!')
('Quatre', "If we need to adjust our equipment or anything, now's<br/>the perfect time.")
('System', 'Van bound the unconscious Alexandre.')
('Van', "(This big boy must've been drawn in here by<br/>someone's karma.)")
('Van', "(Looks like an evil spirit that loves peckin' at justice.<br/>Doubt it can leave this place, but we may wanna take<br/>care of it anyway.)")
('System', 'A fearsome foe is prowling around.')
('System', 'Found <br/>.')
('System', 'Found <br/>.')
('Van', "(This big boy must've been drawn in here by<br/>someone's karma.)")
('Van', "(Looks like an evil spirit that loves feastin' on<br/>anything that's gray. Doubt it can leave this place, but<br/>we may wanna take care of it anyway.)")
('System', 'A fearsome foe is prowling around.')
('System', 'Found <br/>.')
('System', 'Found <br/>.')
