('Rumsfeld', "Oh, I wasn't expecting to see you all again so soon.")
('Rumsfeld', 'Have you learned anything about the young lady or<br/>her captors?')
('Van', "Sorry, we're still lookin' into it. We'll be sure to<br/>update you as soon as we know everything.")
('Rumsfeld', 'I understand. Please, do what you must to get to the<br/>bottom of this. Spare no effort for my lady.')
('Park Ranger', "Happy Revolution Festival! As you'd probably expect,<br/>the park is absolutely brimming with people today.")
('Park Ranger', "Big surprise when it's named after Sheena Dirke,<br/>I know. It's always crazy when this time of year<br/>rolls around.")
('Park Ranger', "Feel free to enjoy yourselves as long as you like.<br/>The weather's just perfect today!")
('Park Ranger', "You guys never seem to catch a break. I feel like<br/>you're always wrapped up in something when I<br/>see you.")
('Park Ranger', "Anyway, the forest's been closed off this whole time.<br/>I have to imagine it's pretty thick with monsters.")
('Park Ranger', "Be careful in there. If you need to step out, don't<br/>hesitate to do so.")
('Park Ranger', 'Oh, I remember you guys. You helped us out with our<br/>monster problem earlier.')
('Park Ranger', "Thanks again for all that! As you can see, we're back<br/>in business thanks to you.")
('Park Ranger', "A few areas still need work, but they'll reopen when<br/>they're ready. Hopefully we'll see a good uptick in<br/>visitors when all's said and done.")
('Park Ranger', "Once you enter the park, take a right and head over<br/>to the waterfront. You'll find the monster there.<br/>Thanks so much for doing this.")
('Park Ranger', "Oh, it's almost time for me to trade places. My shift's<br/>nearly up.")
('Park Ranger', "Someone else will probably be posted here when you<br/>get back. Make sure to return the key to them when<br/>you're ready to leave, all right?")
('Feri', 'Sure, no problem!')
('Van', "Great. Now let's get out there and find us<br/>that monster.")
('Park Ranger', '*sigh* Okay, on to the next task...')
('Park Ranger', "Oh, sorry, I'm really busy over here right now.")
('Park Ranger', "Someone else will probably be posted here when you<br/>get back. Make sure to return the key to them when<br/>you're ready to leave, all right?")
(15290, "Freakin'...! Of all the days to close the park, they had<br/>to do it today?!")
(15291, "There's hardly any buses out here, too! We had no<br/>other way of getting back to town. *sigh* Our big date<br/>is ruined!")
('Giordano', "Now that's a shame, brother. Hate to see a lovely<br/>couple's parade get rained on so hard.")
('Giordano', "Tell you what: why don't I introduce you cool cats to<br/>a groovy restaurant on the way back to town? We can<br/>still save this date. You in?")
(15290, "For real? Sure, we'd love to! By all means!")
('Feri', 'Mmm! The air is so fresh out here!')
('Aaron', "Huh. Never would've figured they'd have a green<br/>patch like this right next to the capital.")
('Aaron', "Looks empty, though. Where're all the people?")
('Van', "Seems like they've had the place closed off since<br/>yesterday due to the whole monster problem.")
('Van', "Otherwise there'd be a pile of buses and people right<br/>in front of us.")
('Feri', "Hey, you're right! It really is closed.")
('Van', "They should know we're comin'. Let's have a chat<br/>with the ranger.")
('Park Ranger', "Did you folks just drive up? I hate to break it to you,<br/>but we're closed for today.")
('Van', "Actually, we're here on business.")
('System', "Van explained that they came in response to the<br/>park's request.")
('Park Ranger', "Oh, so you're the ones who are coming in to<br/>help, huh? Yeah, they told me to expect you.")
('Feri', 'Sounds like you guys have a really nasty monster on<br/>your hands!')
('Park Ranger', 'Yeah. It happens from time to time, unfortunately.<br/>The environment attracts them.')
('Park Ranger', 'Usually, the bracers send out a big squad when this<br/>sort of thing happens. Are you three going to be okay<br/>going in alone?')
('Van', "Yeah, we'll be fine. Nothin' we haven't seen before.<br/>Mind opening the gate for us so we can get to work?")
('Park Ranger', 'Of course. Go right in. Thanks for taking care of this<br/>for us.')
('Van', 'Going by our information, the monster should be<br/>somewhere along this path.')
('Van', "Let's try and get this thing cleared out before sunset<br/>so we can head back while there's still light out.")
('Aaron', 'Say, if we do a good job here, think you could treat us<br/>to someplace nice in the Entertainment District?')
('Van', 'Yeah, right. In your dreams, kid.')
('Feri', 'Is that statue who I think it is?')
('Aaron', "Yep. Sheena Dirke, Calvard's most<br/>famous revolutionary.")
('Aaron', 'The mother of Calvardian democracy, in the...stone.')
('Van', 'Yep. They opened this park and nature preserve in<br/>her memory after she died.')
('Van', 'When the revolution started, she was all of 20 years<br/>old, give or take. Still just a student.')
('Van', 'She brought together a pretty colorful band of folks to<br/>make it all happen. Even had to take on the<br/>Erebonian army when it intervened.')
('Aaron', "Yeah, that's a hell of a lot to put on your plate.<br/>Girl must've had some real spunk to pull all that off.")
('Feri', 'Totally... Her statue is so beautiful. She looks<br/>so dignified.')
('Feri', 'I remember Abi mentioning how he saw a statue of<br/>the Lance Maiden when he went to the Empire a<br/>long time ago, and...')
('Van', "What's the matter?")
('Feri', "Umm, nothing. It's just... There's something about<br/>her that looks familiar to me.")
('Aaron', 'Huh? What are you...? Actually, hang on. I get that<br/>same feeling, too, weirdly enough.')
('Aaron', "Not sure why. Doesn't really resemble any of the<br/>western chicks I picked up back in Langport.")
('Feri', "'Picked up'? Like, off the ground?")
('Aaron', "...You don't even know what THAT means?")
('Aaron', 'This is why little kids are always so hard to talk to.<br/>Gotta explain every tiny thing to them.')
('Feri', 'Mrr!')
('Van', '(...?)')
('Van', "(Why do these two insist they recognize her?<br/>Sure, you're bound to run into her in textbooks, but<br/>other than that...)")
('Feri', "I don't get it. Why would you pick up women?<br/>Did they need to be carried for some reason?")
('Aaron', 'Nope! Forget I said anything!')
('Van', "Enough, you two. We're here on business, so let's get<br/>down to it.")
('Nina', 'Thank you all so much for saving us!')
('Van', "Relax. It's okay, really. You don't have to keep<br/>repeating yourself.")
('Van', "We got a nice little payout from your director<br/>friend there. As far as I'm concerned, that's all the<br/>thanks I need.")
('Feri', "Are you sure it's okay?")
(40301, 'Absolutely! I never imagined we would be attacked<br/>by monsters!')
(40301, "If anything happened to Nina or my staff, it would've<br/>been a major loss for my new projectâ€”no, the entire<br/>film industry, even.")
(40308, "*sigh* I feel so awful about this. If I'd stayed on top of<br/>things better, none of this would've happened.")
(40308, 'I guess in the chaos surrounding the sudden closure of<br/>the park, nobody remembered to get in touch<br/>with you.')
(40301, 'Ah, water under the bridge. It all turned out fine in<br/>the end!')
(40301, 'Anyway, you Arkride Solutions people were<br/>incredible back there!')
(40301, 'What can I do to convince you all to come work for<br/>me as stunt doubles or extras on my next project?')
('Van', "Hoo, boy. You sure focus on the 'important'<br/>things quick.")
('Van', 'Anyway, you guys work for United Star, yeah?')
('Aaron', "United Star? That's a pretty big-name movie studio.")
('Aaron', "Which... Hold on, 'Nina,' as in...?")
('Nina', "That's right. I'm sorry for not introducing<br/>myself sooner.")
('Nina', "I'm the film actress, Nina Fenly.")
('Nina', "It's flattering that you've heard of me. I'm still fairly<br/>new to the industry, really.")
('Feri', "Whoa! A real actress! You get to be in front of<br/>the camera?! That's so cool!")
('Aaron', "Newbie, my ass. You're pretty damn popular<br/>these days.")
('Aaron', "You're like the number one Easterner in the film biz!")
('Van', "Hell, I'd say Ms. Fenly here's one of the most<br/>up-and-coming actresses of her generation, period.")
('Van', "I've seen a handful of your flicks, and they've all been<br/>worth the watch.")
('Nina', "Aww, thank you! I'm glad you liked them.")
('Nina', "Though, to be honest, I think I still have some<br/>catching up to do before I'll be on the level of my<br/>mentor, Judith.")
('Van', 'You must mean Judith Lanster. Forgot you two are<br/>signed with the same agency.')
('Feri', "(I remember that name! Isn't that...?)")
('Nina', 'Uh...? Is everything...?')
('Aaron', "What's up with you two?")
('Van', "Nothin'. Don't worry about it.")
(40301, "Let's not forget about our bold bracer friend who<br/>jumped into the fray, either!")
(40301, "So impressive at such a young age. And a real catch!<br/>Between you and Beauty's Blade, the guild's not<br/>doing bad for itself these days!")
('Fie', 'Glad to be of service.')
('Fie', 'I guess some wires got crossed with<br/>park management. They contacted me, asking if I<br/>could take care of a monster out here.')
('Fie', "I was a little late for what I came for, apparently, but<br/>I'd still call it a job well done.")
('Fie', "Anyway, I'm Fie Claussell.")
('Fie', "I'm from the Erebonian Bracer Guild, but I'm posted<br/>at the Edith branch as of yesterday.")
('Fie', 'Nice to meet you all.')
('Nina', "I didn't realize you were from the Empire.<br/>Thanks again for all of your help!")
('Fie', "Don't mention it. Keeping the public safe is all in a<br/>day's work for us.")
('Fie', 'Though in this case, I got shown up a little in<br/>that department.')
('Van', "Nah, your timing was great. Another second and we<br/>wouldn't have made it in time.")
('Van', 'I can see why people have been talking about you for<br/>ages, Sylphid.')
('Fie', "Glad to hear it. You're not half bad yourself, spriggan.")
('Feri', '(Sylphid... It really is her...)')
('Aaron', "(Fun-sized's got some killer moves, I'll give her that.)")
('Van', "Sure you don't need a ride back to the capital?<br/>I'm more than happy to take you back.")
('Fie', "It's fine. I came here by car anyway. My friends are<br/>coming back to pick me up.")
('Fie', "In the meantime, I'm going to double check to make<br/>sure there's nothing else nasty lurking around.")
('Feri', "Are you really gonna be okay? It's pretty dangerous all<br/>by yourself... Though, maybe not for you...")
('Fie', "Haha, yeah, I'll be okay. I've handled more than my<br/>fair share over the years.")
('Fie', 'At least as many as your boss here.')
('Van', "High praise, comin' from you.")
('Van', "I'm guessin' Elaine and the Immovable have talked to<br/>you about me?")
('Fie', 'Yeah, a little bit.')
('Fie', "Zin says you like to act like a bad boy, but that deep<br/>down, you're an old softie who'll take on just about<br/>anybody's request.")
('Van', '...Looks like I need to have a chat with a certain<br/>walking slab of muscle later.')
('Aaron', "Hah! Well, where's the lie? Dude's got your number.")
('Feri', 'Ahaha... Ha...')
('Fie', "Anyway, I'll let you guys go now. We can save the<br/>chat for another day.")
('Fie', "I'd leave soon, if I were you. It's about to get dark,<br/>and it sounds like we've got rain on the way.")
('Van', 'Thanks for the tip. Catch you later, Sylphidâ€”I<br/>mean, Claussell.')
('Fie', 'Right. Catch you later, spriggan. And you guys, too.')
('Nina', '...')
('System', 'Received')
('Park Ranger', "Well, if it isn't Arkride Solutions, at it again. Back on<br/>official business today?")
('Van', 'What can I say? Another day, another mira.')
('Van', "Basically, we need to get into the sealed-off part of<br/>the park to sort somethin' out for our client.<br/>Think you can help us out?")
('Park Ranger', 'You must mean the forest. No matter how often we<br/>clear it of monsters, they always have a way<br/>of reappearing.')
('Park Ranger', "The closure was only ever intended to be temporary,<br/>but it's stayed like that for five years now.")
('Park Ranger', "Regardless, I'm sure you guys will be fine. Go ahead<br/>and take this.")
('System', 'Obtained Memorial Park Forest Key.')
('Van', "Much obliged. We'll make sure to give it back on the<br/>way out.")
('AgnÃ¨s', "*sigh* I don't believe you, Van.")
('Aaron', "Very smooth, ignoring the 'official' part of that<br/>ranger's question.")
('Quatre', "Hmm... This doesn't feel entirely ethical to me.")
('Feri', "Huh? I don't get it. What's the big deal?")
('Maxim', "You're as underhanded as ever. Oh, well. At least now<br/>we can get in and retrieve that photo!")
('Van', "Sure. If there's anything left of it to still be found,<br/>that is.")
('Risette', 'The sealed-off forest in question appears to be to<br/>the left. We should make our way over.')
('System', 'Maxim is now accompanying the party.')
('Rumsfeld', "Oh, it's so good to see you all!")
('Rumsfeld', "I gather your investigation into the culprit has<br/>finished, yes? Would you please inform me of what<br/>you've found?")
('Van', "Sure. We've more or less figured out what led to all<br/>of this. It's gonna take some explainin', so we'll go<br/>one step at a time.")
('Van', "First thing you should know is, your girl's been<br/>hangin' out with a local punk named Eddy.")
('Van', "He's part of a gang known as Desire, though he<br/>hasn't really fit in with them much until now.")
('Rumsfeld', "Desire? I've heard of that group.")
('Rumsfeld', "People say they're so ruthless and cunning, even the<br/>police closely monitor their movements.")
('AgnÃ¨s', "It's true. Yet despite all that, it seems that Eddy's<br/>been making a fair bit of money lately.")
('AgnÃ¨s', 'In fact, it started happening right when he and<br/>Berzelia first met.')
('AgnÃ¨s', 'We have reason to believe these two facts are<br/>connected to each other.')
('Rumsfeld', "I think I understand what you're trying to say.")
('Rumsfeld', 'Essentially, you believe that this Eddy fellow is<br/>receiving payment in exchange for befriending<br/>my lady?')
('Van', 'Yeah, something like that.')
('Van', 'Considering who he hangs with, it makes sense that<br/>Desire would put him up to this.')
('Van', "Although it's possible that the money might actually<br/>come directly from Berzelia herself.")
('Rumsfeld', 'Hmm... I see.')
('Risette', "To that end, we've uncovered evidence that appears<br/>to tie all of this together.")
('Risette', 'According to his mother, Eddy said something rather<br/>peculiar to her.')
('Risette', "Namely, that if his so-called 'current assignment'<br/>went well, he could be promoted to the gang's<br/>upper leadership.")
('Risette', 'Considering the timing of this statement, it feels all<br/>but certain that this assignment in question must refer<br/>to the kidnapping and ransom.')
('Rumsfeld', 'I see... I believe I understand the situation now.')
('Rumsfeld', 'Basically, it was Eddy who committed the<br/>kidnapping, while Desire was the organization that<br/>masterminded it, correct?')
('Feri', "Yeah, but that's not all. This is where things<br/>get crazy.")
('Feri', 'It looks like Berzelia herself was in on the plan, too!')
('Aaron', 'Yeah, but it gets shittier than that.')
('Aaron', "From what we've heard, your little princess was all too<br/>happy to have those goons whisk her off and hold her<br/>for 'ransom.'")
('Rumsfeld', 'Sh-She was? I...')
('Van', 'It checks out the more you think about it. Long story<br/>short, this whole thing is...')
('Van', '(A legit kidnapping plot hatched by Desire...)')
('Van', "(It's not completely wrong, but there's more to this<br/>case than that alone.)")
('Van', '(A fake kidnapping conceived by Berzelia with the<br/>help of Desire...)')
('Van', "(It's not completely wrong, but there's more to this<br/>case than that alone.)")
('Van', 'The truth of the matter is, this kidnapping is both<br/>real and staged at the same time.')
('Rumsfeld', '...')
('Rumsfeld', 'I will admit, I had the faintest suspicion deep down<br/>that may indeed be the case.')
('Rumsfeld', 'Then let me rephrase my earlier assessment.<br/>In essence, my lady initially devised the kidnapping to<br/>be staged.')
('Rumsfeld', "However, now that Desire is involved, they're now<br/>attempting to turn it into an actual one with genuine<br/>stakes, yes?")
('Van', "Bingo. They're only pretending to help her with<br/>her plan.")
('Van', "But in reality, they're after a much bigger payday.")
('Feri', "Knowing how evil these guys are, I definitely<br/>wouldn't put it past them to try something like this.")
('Aaron', "Yeah, that's the score. They've got a nasty reputation<br/>for a reason.")
('Rumsfeld', "*sigh* If only I had paid greater heed to my<br/>lady's loneliness...")
('Rumsfeld', "Perhaps she wouldn't have felt the need to go to such<br/>extreme lengths.")
('AgnÃ¨s', "I'm so sorry. I can only imagine how you must feel<br/>right now...")
('Van', "It is what it is. We can't take back what's<br/>already happened.")
('Van', "I think more than anything, she's trying to test her<br/>old man to see if he'll choose her over his work.")
('Risette', 'Moving along, I believe the main question now is<br/>how to go about addressing the ransom itself.')
('Risette', 'You do not have to respond to their demands.<br/>We can attempt to ambush them instead, if<br/>you prefer.')
('Rumsfeld', "No, that's quite all right. My lady's safety is<br/>absolutely paramount.")
('Rumsfeld', "As much as I would prefer to avoid doing so, I'm fully<br/>willing to offer the money, if that's what it takes.")
('AgnÃ¨s', 'Are you sure? 10 million mira is a massive amount,<br/>even for the president of a bank.')
('Rumsfeld', 'Indeed it is. Nevertheless, I am prepared to take full<br/>responsibility for such a loss.')
('Rumsfeld', "I'm certain that if my master were here, he would<br/>come to the same decision, without a doubt.")
('Risette', 'As you wish.')
('Van', "All right, then we'll play things straight with them.")
('Van', "But keep in mind, we're talkin' about a gang that had<br/>the guts to pull something like this in the first place.")
('Van', "I don't think it's realistic to expect these goons to be<br/>on the up-and-up when it comes time to make<br/>the exchange.")
('Van', 'Best we stay flexible and see how they act.<br/>Depending on how it all goes down, we may need to<br/>shift gears.')
('Van', "If we do, we still might be able to get the girl back<br/>without you having to fork over any mira.<br/>No promises, but we'll see.")
('Rumsfeld', "Haha... I appreciate the consideration. It's clear how<br/>professional and thorough you all are.")
('Rumsfeld', "Regardless, we still have some time remaining before<br/>our meeting with my lady's captors is set<br/>to commence.")
('Rumsfeld', "Shall we wait here until it's time to depart for the<br/>rendezvous point?")
('Van', 'Hmm... Let me give it some thought.')
('Rumsfeld', "Regardless, we still have some time remaining before<br/>our meeting with my lady's captors is set<br/>to commence.")
('Rumsfeld', "Shall we wait here until it's time to depart for the<br/>rendezvous point?")
('Van', 'Hmm... Let me give it some thought.')
('Van', "Hate to do this to you, but do you mind if we make<br/>some preparations first before headin' out?")
('Rumsfeld', 'Not at all. Take all the time you need. I will be here<br/>awaiting your return.')
('Van', "Might as well. We're all set on our end.")
('Van', 'Actually, before we go...I doubt those goons would<br/>take too kindly to all of us rolling up at once.')
('Van', "We should keep the number of people who meet with<br/>'em to a minimum. You okay if it's only me who<br/>tags along?")
('Rumsfeld', 'Certainly. That sounds like a wise suggestion.')
('Rumsfeld', "If I may make a suggestion, Mr. Arkride, why don't<br/>you pretend to be my subordinate?")
('Van', "Hah. Never thought I'd be an underbutler. Works<br/>for me.")
('Risette', 'In that case, the rest of us will remain close by so that<br/>we can quickly move in, should you require<br/>our assistance.')
('AgnÃ¨s', 'That sounds like a plan. Be careful, you two!')
('Feri', "Good luck, guys! You've got this!")
('Aaron', "Knock 'em dead, chief. Let's see those hostage<br/>negotiation skills of yours.")
('Van', 'Thanks, guys. Stay sharp in case things go south.')
('System', 'Several minutes later, Van and Rumsfeld arrived at<br/>the location designated for the ransom delivery.')
('System', 'With only moments to spare, the two came prepared,<br/>hauling an attachÃ© case filled with mira.')
('Jeffrey', '...There you are.')
('Berzelia', 'Rumsfeld! You came!')
('Rumsfeld', "Oh, my lady! I'm so relieved you're all right!")
('Jeffrey', "Whoa, now. Let's not count our chickens before<br/>they've hatched.")
('Jeffrey', "We specifically asked for the girl's pops to come do<br/>the trade-off, but I sure don't see him anywhere.<br/>What's the deal?")
('Jeffrey', "Don't tell me he's the guy next to you. I find that a<br/>little hard to swallow.")
('Rumsfeld', 'No. The master is currently away on business in a<br/>remote region. We, as her bodyguards, have been<br/>dispatched in his stead.')
('Van', "Sorry I'm not the guy you're lookin' for.")
('Van', "But don't worry. We still made sure to bring what<br/>you're really after.")
('Van', 'We got ten million mira right here. Should be<br/>enough to satisfy, yeah?')
('Jeffrey', "Eh, it's good enough. You held up the bare minimum<br/>of your end, at least.")
('Jeffrey', 'Sucks to be you, though, eh, girlie?')
('Jeffrey', "His own daughter gets nabbed, and your old man just<br/>throws some cash at the problem. Can't even be<br/>bothered to show his face.")
('Jeffrey', "Don't you think it's a little suspicious he's at work?<br/>Maybe he decided to ditch you and hang out with his<br/>girl-toy instead.")
('Berzelia', 'My father would never do any such thing.')
('Berzelia', "But...I suppose, perhaps, that he...doesn't love me<br/>after all, if even this failed to sway him.")
('Eddy', 'Poor girl...')
('Rumsfeld', 'My lady, you have nothing to fear.')
('Rumsfeld', "It's true the master is...ill-mannered at times.<br/>But there's nobody in all of Zemuria who loves you<br/>more than he.")
('Rumsfeld', "If you don't mind, I have a message I'd like for you<br/>to hear. Perhaps it will demonstrate how he<br/>truly feels.")
('Berzelia', "Is that...my Xipha? What's that doing here?")
('Rumsfeld', 'The master sent a recording to this device yesterday.')
('Rumsfeld', 'Please, have a listen.')
(40302, '*bzzt* Is this thing on? Am I being recorded?')
(40302, 'Ahem. First, I should explain that I have to take off<br/>this morning on the first train out.')
(40302, 'Since we cannot speak in person, I wanted to leave...a<br/>message for you, at the very least.')
('Berzelia', "That's...my father's voice! It's really him!")
(40302, 'I... I am so sorry, Berzelia.')
(40302, "I'm always so distracted with my work. I can only<br/>imagine how lonely you must feel.")
(40302, "Your birthday is coming up soon, isn't it.")
(40302, "I know I was away on other business trips for the past<br/>two birthdays, and wasn't able to celebrate as I<br/>should have.")
(40302, "But I promise you, I'll do whatever it takes to make<br/>sure I'm home in time for your birthday this year.")
(40302, "And when I do return, I'm going to give you your<br/>present myself.")
(40302, 'Until then, it pains me that I have to leave you alone<br/>yet again.')
(40302, 'Please, try to keep your spirits up. Know that I really,<br/>truly do love you, Berzelia...my darling daughter.')
('Berzelia', "*sniffle* Father! I didn't realize you cared so much...!")
('Eddy', 'Heh, glad he decided to step up and show he knows<br/>how to be a dad for once.')
('Van', "How'd you manage to come across that voicemail?<br/>I'm genuinely impressed.")
('Rumsfeld', 'Well, I remembered that the master asked me several<br/>days ago how to send such a message to someone.')
('Rumsfeld', 'It made me wonder if, perhaps, it was the young lady<br/>to whom he sent it. Then, when I went searching, sure<br/>enough, there it was.')
('Berzelia', "*sniffle* How could I have been such a fool?<br/>I shouldn't have doubted Father and tested him<br/>like this.")
('Berzelia', "I'm sorry, Rumsfeld. I must confess. This whole<br/>kidnapping...was my own plan.")
('Berzelia', "I...was scared Father didn't truly love me, so I...")
('Rumsfeld', 'Think nothing of it, my lady. You felt the need to act.<br/>I completely understand how you must feel.')
('Berzelia', '*sniffle* Heehee... Thanks, Rumsfeld.')
('Berzelia', "I'm okay, Eddy. You can let go of my hand now.")
('Berzelia', 'I might not have achieved what I set out to do, but I<br/>still want to pay everyone what I can in exchange for<br/>their time.')
('Eddy', "Berzelia, you don't have to do that. But if you're<br/>comfortable with it, I won't stop you.")
('Jeffrey', 'Nnnot. So. Quick, Eddy.')
('Jeffrey', "This dumbass sob story's over! Now the<br/>fun begins!")
('Berzelia', 'Wh-What is the meaning of this?! We had a deal!<br/>Are you breaking it?!')
('Jeffrey', 'You bet your fine, rich ass we are! Why take your<br/>pitiful paycheck when we could make off with that<br/>hefty ransom?!')
('Jeffrey', "And it's all thanks to our wonderful pal, Eddy.<br/>We couldn't have done it without him.")
('Jeffrey', "It's not every day you meet a gullible mark who's just<br/>begging to be held hostage and robbed of her<br/>own money!")
('Berzelia', "You can't be serious. You tricked me, Eddy? I<br/>trusted you!")
('Eddy', "No, that's not true! I only agreed to help out with<br/>your fake kidnapping, I swear! This is news to<br/>me, too!")
('Jeffrey', "And as for you two gents...don't even think about<br/>trying anything funny.")
('Jeffrey', 'Hand over the case, nice and quiet-like.')
('Jeffrey', "And make it quick, or else I can't guarantee daddy's<br/>little girl will celebrate her birthday in one piece.")
('Rumsfeld', 'You...! If you put even a single scratch on Ms.<br/>Berzelia, you will pay for it!')
('Van', "Man, I hate bein' right. I had a feeling it'd go down<br/>like this.")
('Jeffrey', "I didn't ask you to introduce yourself, but I know<br/>you're that famous spriggan everyone always<br/>talks about.")
('Jeffrey', "I was on the lookout for cops or bracers, but I sure<br/>didn't count on meeting someone like you.<br/>That geezer there's one conniving old fart.")
('Rumsfeld', 'So you know about Mr. Arkride as well, do you?')
('Rumsfeld', "I figured you to be some mere hoodlum, but it<br/>appears you're smarter than you look. A shame you<br/>waste it on such nonsense.")
('Van', 'Well, if you know who I am, then we can cut right to<br/>the chase.')
('Van', "I took on a job, and I fully intend to complete it.<br/>You're givin' that girl back, one way or another.")
('Van', 'If you wanna make a deal, we can talk, but not until<br/>you hand her over first.')
('Van', "Otherwise I've got permission from my butler friend<br/>to send you all straight to Aidios. Don't think I won't<br/>do it.")
('Eddy', 'Hey, hold on a minute, Jeffrey!')
('Eddy', 'The Desire I know would never stoop to something<br/>this low!')
('Eddy', "Put the gun down before you do anything we'll<br/>all regret! Please!")
('Jeffrey', "We'd 'never' do something like this? Pff-ha!<br/>Don't make me laugh. You don't know the first thing<br/>about us.")
('Jeffrey', 'Listen, I got you in the gang for one reason and one<br/>reason only: because you made for a handy,<br/>expendable pawn.')
('Jeffrey', 'But you know what? You did good, putting this rich<br/>brat up to all this. Better than I ever expected, really.')
('Jeffrey', "I owe you one, so I'll tell you what: you can leave our<br/>gang right now, if you're so queasy about getting your<br/>hands dirty. How 'bout it?")
('Eddy', "You can't... You can't be serious. Jeffrey, tell me<br/>you're lying!")
('Eddy', 'I looked up to you! I thought you were badass!')
(40351, "Quit yer snivellin', already!")
('Eddy', 'Augh!')
('Berzelia', 'EDDY!')
('Jeffrey', 'Anyway, getting back to business.')
('Jeffrey', 'Where were we? Oh, right, letting the girl go free.')
('Jeffrey', "I wouldn't push my luck if I were you. Last time I<br/>checked, you weren't in a position to be making<br/>demands of us.")
('Jeffrey', "Far as we're concerned, this chick's just a pile of used<br/>bait, now. You sure you want to push your luck?")
('Berzelia', 'Eep!')
('Rumsfeld', '...Very well. We shall hand over the case.')
('Rumsfeld', 'All we ask is that you return the young lady to<br/>us unharmed.')
('Jeffrey', 'Yeah, yeah, you got my word.')
('Jeffrey', 'Now step forward niiice and slowly. Any sudden<br/>movements and I blow her brains out.')
('Jeffrey', 'Stop right there.')
('Jeffrey', "Leave the case on the ground and go straight back.<br/>I'll only let her go if you do.")
('Van', 'Got it. I hear you.')
('Van', "(Now comes the tricky part. There's no way he hands<br/>her over quietly.)")
('Van', '(We already agreed that Rumsfeld would go in and<br/>rescue her while I held these idiots back.)')
('Van', '(The question is what to do about the money.<br/>The safest thing would be to prioritize her safety and<br/>let the cash go.)')
('Van', "(But that'd be ten million mira down the drain.<br/>Hardly chump change.)")
('Van', '(On the flip side, Rumsfeld and I could trust Eddy<br/>with the case and focus on rescuing the girl. What to<br/>do...?)')
('Van', "(It's settled. Forget the money. Rescuing the girl<br/>comes first!)")
('Van', 'All right, look. We have every intention of giving you<br/>the money, just like you asked.')
('Van', "But we need to trust you'll fill your end of<br/>the bargain. What do you say you let her go forward a<br/>bit, first?")
('Jeffrey', "What did I just tell you?! You're in no position to try<br/>and boss me around. Now, are you gonna do as I say,<br/>or what?")
('Van', 'Fine. You made your point. Is this good enough<br/>for you?')
('System', 'Van did as he was told and tossed the attachÃ© case.')
('Jeffrey', 'Hah! You moron! You really did it?!')
('Van', "You're damn right, I did. Now it's your turn.<br/>Hand her over, now!")
('Jeffrey', 'Hahahaha...')
('Jeffrey', 'Ahahahahaha!')
('Jeffrey', "You think after netting this much cash doing<br/>nothing, I'm just gonna let her go? I'd have to be<br/>stupider than you!")
('Jeffrey', "Amazing. A few measly little threats were enough to<br/>convince you to part ways with 10 million mira.<br/>You're one of a damn kind.")
('Jeffrey', "We'll be holding on to her for the time being.<br/>Better start scrounging up some more mira for the<br/>next ransom!")
('Berzelia', 'No!')
('Van', 'Heh, too damn predictable!')
('Jeffrey', "Get the mira, boys! It's ours now!")
(40351, 'Yes, sir!')
('Jeffrey', "Don't think I didn't see this coming, too!")
('Van', "Ggh... Right back at'cha!")
('Jeffrey', 'Wha...?!')
('Rumsfeld', 'My lady, over here!')
('Berzelia', 'O-Okay!')
('Jeffrey', 'Gah, what the hell are you idiots doing?!')
(40351, "D-Don't blame me, boss! That old dick's stronger<br/>than he looks!")
('Jeffrey', "Damn it. I wasn't planning on you guys putting up<br/>such a fight.")
('Jeffrey', "Here's a thought: how about I take the money and we<br/>call it even. Deal?")
('Van', 'Fine. Much as I hate seeing you get your grubby<br/>hands on it.')
('Jeffrey', 'Hahaha, haters gonna hate! Later, suckers!')
('Van', 'What an asshole. That leader of theirs was a crafty<br/>little prick to the end.')
('Van', 'Hmm?')
('Eddy', 'Ack... Ow...')
('Berzelia', "Eddy! You're all right!")
('AgnÃ¨s', '*sigh* Well, that escalated quickly.')
('AgnÃ¨s', "At least it seems like Berzelia made it out safe<br/>and sound. That's what counts.")
('Feri', 'The bad guys were able to make off with the ransom<br/>money, though...')
('Aaron', 'Yeah. Sucks the bastards made out with those ten<br/>million smackers, though.')
('Rumsfeld', "Please, don't concern yourselves with that. It was a<br/>small sum to pay to ensure my lady's safety.")
('Risette', 'Indeed. Without that money, I doubt they would<br/>have backed down otherwise.')
('Van', "That's my take, too. We managed to resolve things<br/>amicably enough.")
('Eddy', '...')
('Eddy', "I'm...so sorry I put you through that nightmare.<br/>I can't tell you how glad I am that you're okay.")
('Berzelia', "It's all right, Eddy. I'm just relieved you aren't<br/>too hurt.")
('Berzelia', "If anyone should be apologizing, it's me. I feel terrible<br/>for believing that you deceived me...")
('Risette', "It's nice to see the two of you make amends.")
('Rumsfeld', 'I must emphasize, your business with us is not done.<br/>You put the young lady in danger in the first place.')
('Rumsfeld', 'I wish to hear your side of the story later, in order to<br/>get a full picture of what transpired. Is that all right?')
('Eddy', "Yes, absolutely. I don't know how I'll ever make up<br/>for the lost money, though...")
('Berzelia', "Please, don't take this out on Eddy! It's my fault any<br/>of this ever happened.")
('Van', 'Well, looks like you can handle things from here.')
('Van', "Unless you need anything else, I think we're going<br/>to bounce.")
('Rumsfeld', 'Mr. Arkride, everyone, thank you again for<br/>your assistance.')
('Rumsfeld', 'No words are enough to express my gratitude to you!')
('Van', "(It's settled. I'm gonna trust Eddy to keep the<br/>money safe!)")
('Van', "You're damn right, I did. Now it's your turn.<br/>Hand her over, now!")
('Jeffrey', 'Hahahaha...')
('Jeffrey', 'Ahahahahaha!')
('Jeffrey', "You think after netting this much cash doing<br/>nothing, I'm just gonna let her go? I'd have to be<br/>stupider than you!")
('Jeffrey', "Amazing. A few measly little threats were enough to<br/>convince you to part ways with 10 million mira.<br/>You're one of a damn kind.")
('Jeffrey', "We'll be holding on to her for the time being.<br/>Better start scrounging up some more mira for the<br/>next ransom!")
('Berzelia', 'No!')
('Van', 'Heh, too damn predictable!')
('Van', "Hey, buddy! Wanna clear your name and do<br/>somethin' good for once? Think fast!")
('System', 'Van flung the attachÃ© case at Eddy, who caught it.')
('Eddy', 'Huh?!')
('Eddy', "Holyâ€”! This thing's heavy!")
('Jeffrey', 'Think you can scam us outta our dough, do you?<br/>Give it here, Eddy!')
('Eddy', "...No. I'm not letting Desire get a single coin!")
('Jeffrey', 'Wrong choice, buddy. I gave you a chance. Now go<br/>say hi to Aidios, dipshit!')
('Eddy', 'AAAAAAUGH!')
('Berzelia', 'EDDYYY!')
('Jeffrey', 'Wha...?!')
('Rumsfeld', 'My lady, over here!')
('Berzelia', 'O-Okay!')
('Jeffrey', 'Gah, what the hell are you idiots doing?!')
(40351, "D-Don't blame me, boss! That old dick's stronger<br/>than he looks!")
('Jeffrey', "Damn. Never thought they'd put up this much of<br/>a fight.")
('Jeffrey', "But the numbers are on our side. It's five on two!<br/>Or should I say one?")
('Jeffrey', "Famous or not, you're still just a single spriggan<br/>flying solo. I'd love to see you take on all of us!")
('Van', 'You think I still work solo, huh? Well, I got bad news<br/>for you, pal. Arkride Solutions is expanding<br/>these days!')
('AgnÃ¨s', 'Everyone! Are you okay?!')
('Feri', "Your fun's over now that we're here!")
('Aaron', 'Sure took your sweet time calling us in, chief.')
('Rumsfeld', "Now it's five on four, though I do believe it's fair to<br/>say that the balance of power has tipped in the<br/>other direction.")
('Rumsfeld', 'All of which is to say, thank you all for coming to<br/>our aid.')
(40351, "Haha, some reinforcements! You've got chicks<br/>with you!")
(40351, "Yeah, we've still got the edge! Come on, Jeffrey!<br/>Let's get 'em!")
('Jeffrey', '...')
('Jeffrey', "Damn it. No. We're pulling out.")
(40351, 'What?!')
('Jeffrey', "You heard me! I said we're<br/>pulling out!")
(40351, 'Eek!')
(40351, 'Y-You heard him, boys! Time to scram!')
('Jeffrey', "Don't think you've won, jackass. I'll make you regret<br/>crossing us.")
('Van', 'Heh, well, that was a surprising turn of events. I half<br/>expected them to press their luck and come<br/>in swinging.')
('Van', "Guess Desire's got some brains after all, especially in<br/>that fearless leader of theirs.")
('Van', "But...that's not the important thing right now.")
('Eddy', "Shit! I can't believe I actually got shot back there.<br/>Ow...")
('Berzelia', 'Eddy! Rumsfeld, he needs first aid right away!<br/>Can you help him?!')
('Rumsfeld', 'Certainly, my lady.')
('AgnÃ¨s', 'Let me help, too!')
('AgnÃ¨s', 'Phew... Good work, everyone.')
('AgnÃ¨s', 'We got a lot done today, between rescuing Berzelia<br/>and patching up Eddy.')
('Van', "He's not completely out of the woods. I gotta hunch<br/>those goons are going to have it out for him after<br/>what he pulled.")
('Van', "So I took the liberty of tippin' the cops off about this<br/>whole mess so they can keep 'em on their radar.")
('Van', "But at least you'll live to see another day thanks to our<br/>little hostage's quick thinkin', kid.")
('Berzelia', 'Eddy did nothing wrong. He was tricked by all the<br/>rest of them. How could I not help? He even<br/>managed to save the money!')
('Berzelia', "Thank you so much for everything, Eddy. I'm...<br/>I'm so sorry I ever doubted you. What I said<br/>was terrible.")
('Eddy', "No, it's okay, I totally understand. I'm the one who<br/>ought to be apologizing here.")
('Eddy', "I'm...so sorry I put you through that nightmare.<br/>I can't tell you how glad I am that you're okay.")
('Risette', "It's nice to see the two of you make amends.")
('Rumsfeld', "We'll cover the cost of his care. It's the least we can<br/>do to repay him for what he's done.")
('Van', 'Looks like you can handle things from here, then.')
('Van', "Unless you need anything else, I think we're going<br/>to bounce.")
('Rumsfeld', 'Mr. Arkride, everyone, thank you again for<br/>your assistance.')
('Rumsfeld', 'No words are enough to express my gratitude to you!')
('System', 'Quest A Daughter in Danger completed!')
('System', 'Earned')
('System', 'Received')
('Van', 'That must be the forest up ahead.')
('Van', 'Better hit up Raymond before heading on in.')
('System', 'Van contacted Raymond, who proceeded to catch up<br/>to him in short order.')
('System', 'Before proceeding, Raymond then reached out to his<br/>sister Carol, who was too busy with work to<br/>join them.')
('System', 'After promising to meet up later once she could take<br/>a break, the group then ventured into the forest.')
('System', 'Afterwards, Van and Dingo reached the<br/>memorial park.')
('System', 'Upon confirming there were no data transfer<br/>problems with the orbal network, they made their way<br/>back to Edith.')
('System', "Van's pickup truck is parked here.")
('System', 'A bronze statue of Sheena Dirke gallantly stands tall.')
