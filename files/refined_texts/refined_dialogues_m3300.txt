('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', 'O-Oh, right. I should activate the security system just<br/>in case.')
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', 'Security system activated.')
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', 'I-I need to get rid of that evidence, whatever it takes!')
('Van', "He's finally on the move.")
('Agnès', "I didn't know it was possible to do this with shards.")
('Feri', "They're the same camouflage ones Van used to catch<br/>me when we first met!")
('Aaron', 'That voice modification just now was pretty<br/>awesome, too.')
('Aaron', 'Shards can do that, too, huh?')
('Risette', 'They can indeed. Shards can be used in a great many<br/>ways by combining them with a holo.')
('Risette', 'I would be happy to educate you all on the specifics<br/>some other time, if you have an interest.')
('Agnès', "I-If you'd like...<br/>(Though this feels a little illegal, almost...)")
('Agnès', "Anyway, I can't believe this building has such a<br/>massive basement.")
('Van', "Yeah. Turns out Dingo and the CID's intel was right<br/>on the money.")
('Van', "Looks like some kinda research facility...but what I<br/>wanna know is, what're YOU doing here?")
('Fie', "Thought you'd notice me sooner than later.")
('Feri', 'Whoa, hey!')
('Aaron', 'How long have you been up there?!')
('Agnès', "Y-You didn't sneak in before us, did you?")
('Fie', 'Mm-hmm. All the info we got from that reporter and<br/>the CID led me here.')
('Fie', "Too bad I wasn't able to fool your boss or the<br/>concierge there.")
('Risette', 'I noticed you right away when I deployed those<br/>investigative shards.')
('Van', "Makes sense you'd be good at this kinda stealth<br/>mission, though.")
('Van', "Even if I did find you, I sure wasn't expectin' to.<br/>Didn't know everyone's favorite heroes of justice were<br/>into trespassin'.")
('Fie', "We're not when there's any other option. But in this<br/>case...there really wasn't one.")
('Fie', "We can't afford to drag our feet when civilian lives<br/>are in danger.")
('Fie', 'So to cut to the chase: mind if I tag along with you?')
('Van', 'Not in the least. We could use your help, Sylphid.')
('Fie', "Then we're good to go.")
('Aaron', "Seriously...? Aww, screw it. We don't have time to<br/>waste right now.")
('Agnès', 'Yes. We need to rescue Saara as soon as possible!')
('Feri', "Right! Let's get on Gaspard's butt!")
('System', 'Fie has temporarily joined the party as a guest.')
('Aaron', 'Heh. Not our first time seeing those lumps of metal.')
('Feri', 'Yeah. We fought things just like them in Langport.')
('Fie', "These aren't society-made... I'm guessing<br/>they're yours?")
('Risette', 'They are indeed security models from our lineup.')
('Agnès', 'Wait, what?!')
('Feri', 'I-I knew your company sold weapons, but...')
('Risette', "We don't make the weapons ourselves, as that isn't<br/>our company's purview.")
('Risette', 'Our role is to connect those seeking to purchase<br/>weapons with the relevant manufacturers.')
('Aaron', 'What the hell...? You guys are deep in it, huh?')
('Fie', 'The society had a monopoly on that stuff in the<br/>underworld for a pretty long while.')
('Fie', "But recently, Marduk's been stealing a lot of their<br/>market share and expanding aboveboard AND under<br/>the table.")
('Fie', "That's one reason the guild is so wary of you people.")
('Risette', "...I can't say I blame you for that, either.")
('Van', "Still, whether a weapon's good or bad depends on<br/>who's using it.")
('Van', "I take it you weren't aware these things were being<br/>used here?")
('Risette', 'Correct. Vegas Films is not in our client database.')
('Risette', 'I suspect they were procured illicitly.')
('Risette', 'The same is most likely true for the units you fought<br/>in Langport.')
('Aaron', "They're all connected to Almata, then, huh?")
('Agnès', "So it seems—which makes their presence here further<br/>proof of Almata's involvement.")
('Fie', "Yeah. Now let's get moving.")
('Fie', "If we've found this much proof already, it's only going<br/>to keep coming.")
('Agnès', 'Wh-What is all this...?')
('Feri', "It's those plants we found in that cave...")
('Feri', "They must be what's fueling the hookahs.")
('Aaron', "And the fact they're here is pretty much the smoking<br/>gun for our theories.")
('Aaron', 'What do you think these pills are?')
('Van', "Probably the enhancement drug they've been using.")
('Agnès', 'What?! But then...')
('Agnès', "This seems to suggest they're abusing it on a much<br/>broader scale.")
('Fie', "Yeah. I had a feeling this operation was too big to be<br/>'just' for messing with the film festival.")
('Fie', 'This facility must be for researching and<br/>manufacturing illegal drugs like these.')
('Van', "Yeah. And it's probably one of many, too.")
('Risette', 'Regardless, this is concrete proof that Vegas Films is<br/>connected to the development of<br/>unlawful pharmaceuticals.')
('Risette', 'I will record our findings on my Xipha.')
('Van', 'Thanks.')
('Aaron', "Hang on—we're not supposed to be here. This isn't<br/>exactly admissible evidence.")
('Fie', "Well, it's a bit of a gray area, but there's ways of<br/>getting it to count.")
('Fie', 'Like sending the police in for something unrelated<br/>and having them find all this in the process.')
('Aaron', 'Bahaha! Money laundering, but for evidence, huh?<br/>Awesome.')
('Feri', "Ooh! That's a great idea! I'll remember that one!")
('Agnès', 'I feel like some of us are taking the wrong lesson from<br/>all this...')
('Aaron', 'Hey! Look at all that!')
('Feri', "Whoa. They can't all be full of drugs, can they?")
('Van', "I'd put good mira on them being stuffed with<br/>exactly that. Guess this must be where the stuff's<br/>stored until it can be shipped out.")
('Agnès', "There's so much of it...")
('Fie', "You're looking at tens of millions of mira worth of<br/>product in this room alone.")
('Risette', 'I will inspect the terminal. There might be something<br/>of value on it.')
('Van', "Looks like a list of the people buyin' this stuff.")
('Risette', 'Indeed. Covering the past half year, it appears.')
('Risette', 'Most of it is encrypted, so it will take time to extract<br/>all of the details from it.')
('Agnès', "Even so, it's clearly a long list. It seems this drug is<br/>rather more widely distributed than we thought...")
('Aaron', 'We could just sell this baby to Heiyue and have them<br/>take care of the dirty work for us.')
('Aaron', "Can't see us finding anything on Almata in<br/>here, though.")
('Fie', "Yeah. They're not careless enough to leave names and<br/>whatnot in a database like this.")
('Fie', 'But there has to be something on them on this floor.')
('Van', "The president wouldn't have snuck down<br/>here otherwise.")
('Van', "Let's get back on his trail—we can't have far left to<br/>go now.")
('Feri', "Right! Wherever he is, we're bound to find<br/>Saara, too!")
('Van', '(...This has gotta be the place.)')
('Agnès', '(We should be able to peek inside through this gap.)')
('Feri', "(There's Saara!)")
('Aaron', '(That girl better not be—)')
('Fie', "(She's okay. She's breathing.)")
('Risette', '(I suspect she was administered a soporific of<br/>some sort.)')
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', "E-Excellent! Once I dispose of this, I'm scot-free!")
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', 'After that, I just need to dump the girl somewhere<br/>and leverage my political connections to—')
('Fie', "It's too late to pretend none of this happened.")
('Van', "Sorry for showin' up without an appointment,<br/>Mr. Dillon.")
('Feri', 'Kidnapping victim safely secured!')
('Agnès', 'Are you all right, Saara?!')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'Ngh...')
('Risette', 'She is exhausted, but her vitals seem stable.')
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', "Y-You're the handyman those actresses hired!")
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', 'How did you even get in here?! Th-This is<br/>trespassing, you know!')
('Aaron', "You're on our asses about 'trespassing'? We're here<br/>because of the shit you pulled, dumbass.")
('Van', "Goes without sayin' that we'll be payin' you back on<br/>behalf of our client...")
('Van', "But you'll be handing over proof of your honeymoon<br/>with your 'friend,' too.")
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', "W-Wait! Please, let's just talk about this!")
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', "I'm as much of a victim in this as anyone! They, they<br/>blackmailed me into doing their bidding!")
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', "If you just take her and go without making a fuss, I'll<br/>happily give you...ten million mira! Yes! How does<br/>that sound?")
('Aaron', '*whistle*')
('Agnès', "Even now, you're still trying to squirm your way out<br/>of this...")
('Feri', "You don't know when to give up, do you?")
('Van', "I might've given it some thought normally, but not<br/>while our guest's got her eye on us.")
('Fie', "Ugh. Of course you would've.")
('Fie', "Still, you should really be sure who you're talking to<br/>before you start offering bribes.")
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', 'A BRACER?!')
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', "Th-This can't be happening...")
('Fie', 'If you plan on pleading extenuating circumstances,<br/>though, we may be able to help.')
('Fie', 'But only if you give us that file, the evidence that<br/>illegal drugs are being manufactured here, and the<br/>real goal of the festival.')
('Fie', 'That, and provide testimony on all you know<br/>about Almata.')
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', "Y-Y-Y-You can't be SERIOUS! Do you have any<br/>idea what'll happen to me if I rat them out?!")
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', 'They show no mercy to traitors! You must know that!')
('Fie', "Please. I can't imagine you know anything that fatal<br/>to them.")
('Fie', "But we can take you into witness protection after<br/>your arrest. We can even help you flee abroad if that's<br/>what you want.")
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', '...')
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', "I-I really don't know anything! All I did was give<br/>them a place to work!")
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', 'That goes for the orbal hookahs they made here, too!<br/>They just left us orders and ignored us afterwards!')
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', "I wouldn't be surprised if they'd left Tharbad in the<br/>dust by the time the police started their crackdown!")
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', "I don't even know why those thugs were so interested<br/>in Nina and the others to begin with...")
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', 'The whole reason I sent that letter was to try and get<br/>them AWAY from danger!')
('Van', '...Hold on. What did you just say?')
('Agnès', 'Almata had an interest in Nina, Judith, Saara and<br/>the prince?')
('Fie', '...No!')
('Feri', 'From above?!')
('Aaron', 'Hey! Get back here!')
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', "Hahaha! Enjoy yourselves! I'll be exiting stage left!")
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', "I'm sure the prince can manage the festival, so you<br/>fools can do as you please!")
('Feri', "You're not getting away!")
('Van', 'Watch out!')
('Fie', 'A warrior model?! The society used to use ones<br/>like this!')
('Risette', "It's a close-combat prototype based on the models of<br/>which you speak.")
('Risette', "It had reportedly been stolen after delivery to a client,<br/>but I didn't expect to find it here...")
('Aaron', 'This came from you guys, too?! Hey, suggestion: stop<br/>making so much dangerous shit!')
('Risette', 'I do apologize, but filing complaints will have to wait!')
('Van', "Yeah! Let's take this thing down and get on his tail!")
('Agnès', 'Right! / Roger!')
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', '*pant* *pant* That should buy me enough time...')
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', "I've had enough of dealing with criminals! I just want<br/>to get out of the country, and—")
('Melchior', 'Criminals? Such a cruel label. Here I was thinking we<br/>were friends.')
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', "Y-You're...")
('Melchior', 'Just how could you be so cold, Gaspard Dillon? ❤')
('Melchior', 'What do you think?')
('Dantès', 'He performed his role well. I will commend him<br/>for that.')
('Dantès', 'Rest assured, dear Dillon, that we will make this a<br/>festival to remember.')
('Dantès', "It's time we served you as the opening act. Now...let<br/>us see your fear.")
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', 'No... Nonononooo!')
('Feri', 'Whew... We did it.')
('Fie', 'Yup. That takes care of that.')
('Risette', 'We defeated it two minutes faster than I anticipated.<br/>Well done, everyone.')
('Aaron', 'Would you cool it with the pre-battle<br/>combat analysis?!')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', 'Where...am I...?')
('Saara (Pole Dancer)', "What happened to the parade? Where's Shaheena?")
('Agnès', 'Saara!')
('Van', "Glad you're up. Now we've just gotta go after—")
('President Dillon (Corpse Version)', 'GRAAAAAAAAAGH!')
('Aaron', 'Was that—?')
('Van', 'Stay here with Saara!')
('Agnès', 'R-Right!')
('Fie', '...')
('Aaron', 'Damn it all...')
('Van', 'We were too late.')
('System', 'Look forward to the film festival <br/>\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000❤ Melchior')
