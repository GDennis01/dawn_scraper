('Agnès', '...!')
('Bergard', 'What a peculiar space...')
('Quatre', "It's a terrifying sight to behold, and yet I feel...warm<br/>just being here.")
('Feri', "I've never been to this place before, but I'm feeling<br/>oddly nostalgic.")
('Judith', 'Yeah. So nostalgic that it hurts.')
('Aaron', '...')
('Agnès', 'Van!')
(61900, "\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000You've gotta be kidding me...<br/>What are you idiots doing? You shouldn't be here.")
(61900, "\u3000Thought I told you to take care of them, Master.<br/>Why'd you let them come to this place?")
('Bergard', 'You will have plenty of time to berate me for it later!')
('Feri', "You can't leave us, Van!")
('Quatre', "This can't be the only way to deal with that demon!<br/>I refuse to accept that!")
(61900, "Well, accept it. We're talking about a being<br/>that sees the entire world as its enemy.")
(61900, "I've felt its presence for so long...<br/>It's been with me since I was a kid.")
(61900, "\u3000\u3000But I couldn't tell anyone about it.<br/>It was a secret I planned to take to the grave.")
(61900, "I can't destroy this thing, but I can seal it away<br/>in the boundary between here and the beyond.")
(61900, "It'll at least keep it at bay for a few centuries.<br/>That's the best I can do to protect your futures.")
(61900, "\u3000 So leave me be. This is the choice that I've made. <br/>It's not a black-or-white decision. It's—")
('Agnès', "We're not going to leave you, Van!")
('Agnès', "You may have chosen to come here of your own<br/>volition, but we've made a choice of our own.<br/>We're taking you back!")
('Aaron', "You know full well I'm not like the cops or bracers.<br/>I do things my own way.")
('Aaron', "And that way isn't black, but it definitely ain't<br/>white, either. Mine's like the color of a dark blue sky<br/>just before dawn.")
('Agnès', "I'm not going to become a wholly different person if I<br/>stay by your side.")
('Agnès', "I'm very much my own woman, and that's not about<br/>to change.")
('Agnès', "Your way isn't black, white, or even gray. You said it's<br/>like the color of the dark blue sky just before dawn...")
('Agnès', "...but to me, it's like the dawn itself. It's a warm,<br/>comforting light that illuminates our way and<br/>breaks through the darkest nights.")
('Agnès', "And I never want to part from that light again!<br/>We aren't going to let you go—no matter what!")
(61900, '...!')
('Aaron', "You wanna up and leave us that bad, huh?<br/>Well, normally I'd say, 'Eh, that's your call. So long,<br/>my dude.'")
('Aaron', "But you've still got an outstanding debt, so I'm not<br/>letting you bail on me.")
('Feri', "Yeah! I'll drag you back by the collar if I have to!")
('Quatre', "Let us help you, Van. You always stick your neck out<br/>for us, so why can't we return the favor?")
('Quatre', "If we were in your shoes, you'd rush to our aid<br/>without a second thought! Don't deny it!")
(61900, '...')
('Risette', "Heehee. I'm afraid he's got you there, Mr. Arkride.<br/>I can easily picture that happening.")
('Risette', 'If any of us were in danger, you would move heaven<br/>and earth itself to ensure our safety.')
('Judith', "Once a softie, always a softie. Honestly, you should<br/>drop the whole 'I'm not good or bad' thing.")
('Judith', "You're just a teensy bit too young for the weary<br/>warrior act, don't you think?")
(61900, 'Everyone... Why...?')
('Bergard', "You have actively forged many bonds throughout<br/>this year. I'm afraid this is simply karma at work.")
('Bergard', "Don't think you can run away from them so easily,<br/>young man.")
(61900, 'Master...')
('Agnès', "Wh-What's happening?!")
(61900, '\u3000Damn it... This is way too soon!')
(61900, "\u3000\u3000Get out of here, now! <br/>It's going to...")
(61900, 'WHO HAS AWOKEN ME FROM MY SLUMBER?<br/>\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000WAS IT YOU?')
('Feri', "It's talking directly into my mind...")
('Judith', "What in the world... What's going on here?!")
(61900, 'IN THIS WORLD, I AM THE BEING KNOWN AS<br/>\u3000\u3000\u3000THE VAGRANT DEMON LORD.')
(61900, 'I AM CONNECTED TO THE ONE YOU CALL<br/>VAN ARKRIDE THROUGH A DIABOLIC CORE.')
('Risette', "The demon that's been residing within Mr. Arkride<br/>must have taken control!")
('Quatre', 'B-But why? What happened to Van?')
(61900, 'MY FOOLISH VESSEL REBELLED AGAINST ME.<br/>\u3000HE SOUGHT TO CHAIN ME TO THE VOID.')
(61900, 'THE ENDLESS PASSAGE OF TIME HOLDS<br/>LITTLE MEANING TO A BEING SUCH AS MYSELF.')
(61900, 'HOWEVER, SUCH BOUNDLESS ARROGANCE<br/>CANNOT GO UNPUNISHED.')
('Bergard', 'Ugh!')
('Aaron', 'Get outta here!')
('Agnès', 'Yes! Will you kindly disappear already?!')
('Agnès', 'We were talking to Van—not you!')
('Agnès', "We don't care about you in the slightest!")
('Agnès', 'So get out of our sight...and return Van to us at once!')
('Feri', 'The Geneses are reacting?!')
('Judith', "Wh-What's happening now?")
(61900, '...')
(61900, '\u3000\u3000I SEE. SO YOU HAVE THEIR POWER<br/>AT YOUR DISPOSAL. THAT EXPLAINS HOW<br/>\u3000THAT ㌍㌫㌻ WAS ABLE TO BIND ME.')
('Quatre', 'I think the Geneses are having an effect!')
('Risette', 'Yes. I can confirm that its strength has decreased.')
('Agnès', "Good. I think Van's body is still somewhere inside<br/>of it.")
('Agnès', 'We just need to weaken it a little more...')
('Aaron', "Ugh. Just let me at it, already! I'll rip it to shreds!")
('Bergard', 'Our odds of victory have increased exponentially!')
(61900, 'MANY EONS HAVE PASSED SINCE I LAST<br/>\u3000ENTERED THE REALM OF MORTALS.')
(61900, 'I WILL STRIKE DOWN ALL THAT STAND IN MY WAY.<br/>\u3000FACE THE ABYSS, INSIGNIFICANT HUMANS.')
('Feri', "We'll show you who's insignificant!")
('Judith', 'Your first and last mistake...is underestimating<br/>us humans!')
('Quatre', 'A crack appeared!')
('Agnès', 'Yes! Maybe Van can—')
(61910, 'OOOOOOOOOH!')
(61910, 'INSOLENT VESSEL. YOU DARE<br/>\u3000\u3000\u3000OPPOSE ME?!')
('Van', "Oh, I dare, all right! I'm bustin' outta here!")
('Feri', 'Van!')
('Risette', 'Thank goodness!')
('Bergard', 'Can you still fight?')
('Van', "Hell yeah. I'm in top form. Got a lot I wanna say<br/>to y'all...")
('Van', "...but that can wait. We got a demon lord to slay,<br/>and I'm gonna need everyone's help to do it.<br/>Can you gimme a hand?!")
('Quatre', 'Do you even have to ask?')
('Judith', "Since we're so nice, we'll do it on the house!")
('Risette', 'Leave all your support needs to me!')
('Agnès', 'Here, Van. Catch!')
('Van', 'Thanks! Mare!')
('Mare', "Well, look who's back. Just say the word, and I'll do<br/>my thing!")
('Van', "Okay. Let's do this!")
('Aaron', "Heh. I think it's time for the big, bad demon lord to<br/>kiss its ass goodbye! What do you say, Van?")
('Van', 'Yeah...')
(61910, 'YOU TRULY ARE...AN IGNORANT VESSEL.')
(61910, 'IF YOU THINK YOU CAN ESCAPE ME,<br/>\u3000YOU ARE SORELY MISTAKEN.')
('Van', "In some ways, that thing's an extension of myself.")
('Van', "If you guys've got any pent-up anger toward me...<br/>then let it loose on that thing instead!")
('Feri', 'Will do!')
('Agnès', "We won't allow you to hurt anyone else. Prepare to<br/>meet your end!")
(40501, 'URRRRRRRRGH!')
(40501, 'HOW COULD THIS BE? EVEN IN MY WEAKENED STATE,<br/>\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN BESTED.')
('Van/Grendel', 'Well, you were, so suck it up. No one likes a<br/>sore loser.')
('Van/Grendel', "'Fraid I'm just not ready to give in to you yet.<br/>My body and soul are still mine, so do me a favor<br/>and scram.")
(40501, '...')
(40501, 'VERY WELL. I SHALL RETREAT FOR THE<br/>\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000TIME BEING.')
(40501, 'BUT REMEMBER THIS: YOU AND I ARE ONE<br/>AND THE SAME—AND WE ALWAYS WILL BE.')
(40501, 'AS LONG AS YOU LIVE, YOU WILL NEVER KNOW PEACE.<br/>\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000YOU HAD BEST NOT FORGET THAT.')
('Agnès', '...!')
('Bergard', "It's the diabolic core.")
('Feri', "Wha...?! Don't touch that!")
('Judith', 'We are NOT doing a repeat of last time!')
('Van/Grendel', "Don't worry. I'm just putting this where it belongs.")
('Van/Grendel', 'RRAAAAAAAAAH!')
('Risette', '...')
('Aaron', 'H-He threw the damn thing?!')
('Agnès', 'Oh...')
('Quatre', 'Is it...finally over, then?')
('Van/Grendel', 'Yeah.')
('Van', "At least, it's over for now. How 'bout we get<br/>outta here?")
