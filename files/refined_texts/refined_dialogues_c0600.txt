('Bracer Lahad', "That's the spirit! Keep up that attitude and you'll turn<br/>out to be a fine bracer one day.")

('Bracer Gray', "That's really nice of you. I appreciate it! But there's<br/>one thing that's bothering me a little...")
('Bracer Gray', "(This is a Heiyue restaurant, isn't it? Is it really such a<br/>good idea for people like us to be here so out in<br/>the open?)")

('Bracer Lahad', "'Sides, who's to say we didn't also come here to do a<br/>little espionage and see what the other guys are up<br/>to, hmm?")
('Bracer Gray', 'What...? What?! WHAAAT?!')
('Bracer Gray', "Y-You've got to be kidding me! I had no idea that's<br/>what you had in mind. You play a lot dirtier than<br/>I thought!")
('Bracer Gray', 'In order to become a senior bracer, you have to get<br/>recommendations from every branch.')

('Nadiya', 'I really appreciate my husband coming back home to<br/>see us more frequently, but I worry the constant back<br/>and forth is wearing him out.')

('Nadiya', "You really don't have to fret so much about us, really.<br/>All that constant traveling to and from here must be<br/>getting to you.")

('Secretary Culleo', "No, no, no! This is about me fretting over you two!<br/>I wouldn't have it any other way.")
('Secretary Culleo', "The nice thing about getting assigned to the<br/>Crossbell Consulate is that it's much easier for me to<br/>travel in and out. Much less paperwork.")
('Secretary Culleo', "Plus you're right! Amia is six! How could I not come<br/>and see my daughter's beautiful little face now that<br/>she's growing up fast?")
('Amia', 'Daddy! I wanna see a movie!')
('Secretary Culleo', "Haha, okay, sweetheart. Once we're done eating,<br/>we'll all go see a movie together.")

('Julian', "I'm really glad I decided to study abroad in Calvard.<br/>All the alumni I've met have been really kind people.")
('Julian', "Some people thought this trip was a little premature<br/>just because diplomatic relations are only normalized<br/>again on paper, but I don't care.")

('Van', "(Hmm... If he's talkin' about diplomatic relations, I'd<br/>put my money on him bein' Erebonian.)")

('Agnès', "(It can't always be easy living here, but otherwise, we<br/>all get along with him great.)")
('Fie', "Good to see you're doing great, Julian. Sounds like<br/>things are going well over at Aramis, too.")
('Julian', "Yep! I see you haven't changed a bit, either.")
('Julian', "I know you're always busy, but I hope you have time<br/>to coach me again sometime soon! That'd be<br/>really great!")
('Fie', "Sure, I can do that. Can't really say no when it's you.")
('Fie', "Maybe I'll see if I can get Elaine, Lahad, Alvis, and<br/>Regina to join us. Make it a whole get-together.")
('Van', 'That sounds less like a get-together and more like a<br/>recipe for an incident, if you ask me.')
('Agnès', "Not to change the subject, but you two know<br/>each other? I didn't realize that!")
('Fie', 'Yep. He goes to Thors Military Academy.')
('Fie', "He's a member of Class VII there, to be exact, just<br/>like I was.")

('Van', "Oh, I'm sure he does mean the big hero of the war.<br/>This kid just gets more and more intriguing the<br/>longer we talk to him.")
('Fie', "I know I'm not one to talk, but it's safe to say<br/>everybody who comes out of Class VII is...unique, to<br/>say the least.")
('Fie', "Anyway, I'm sure we'll run into each other a lot while<br/>you're here.")
('Fie', "If anything comes up, feel free to hit me up. I'll be<br/>happy to listen.")

('Chignon', "R-Right, okay! I won't move a single rege from<br/>this spot!")
('Chignon', 'It looks like the staff here are setting up places for<br/>people to rest, too. Maybe I should go give them<br/>a hand.')

('Chignon', "I wasn't able to go to Tharbad to see the film festival,<br/>so I want to visit some place that's movie-related.")
('Chignon', "Hmm... I can't really think of anywhere in particular<br/>no matter how hard I try.")
('Chignon', "One of my favorite movies takes place in Creil,<br/>but that's not really somewhere I have in<br/>mind this time.")
('Chignon', "*sigh* It's no use. I had my heart so set on going to<br/>the Tharbad Film Festival after what happened with<br/>the one in Messeldam.")
('Chignon', "But my mom and dad won't let me go to it! They say<br/>it's too far away!")
('Chignon', "*sob* This sucks! I guess I'll have to rely on people<br/>posting their impressions online about it to get<br/>anything fun out of it.")
('Chignon', "Please! To any Calvard cinephiles going to<br/>the festival! I'm begging you! Post about it on<br/>message bulletins so everyone can read what it's like!")
('Agnès', "Aww. That's a shame you can't go. Can't they<br/>broadcast the festival online like what they do for the<br/>Z1 Grand Prix?")
('Chignon', "Maybe! I don't know if they're going to since it's their<br/>first year running the festival. It's pure agony not<br/>knowing these things! AUGH!")
('Chignon', "Oh, crap! I've seen three movies tonight and it's<br/>almost curfew back at the dorm!")
('Chignon', "But I can't help myself! Salvatore Gotti's movies are<br/>all just so perfect! I never get tired of watching them!")
('Chignon', "And Nike Marceau's performance is so eerie, yet<br/>captivating in Sober Curious!")
('Chignon', "Argh, SCREW IT! I've got nothing to do tomorrow!<br/>I'll come back to the theater tomorrow morning and<br/>hang out for as long as I can!")
('Chignon', "Hey, Agnès! Didn't expect to see you here! Who are<br/>those two?")
('Agnès', 'Hi, Chignon. This is my boss, Van, and my<br/>coworker, Feri.')
('Agnès', 'Are you here to watch another movie?')
('Chignon', "You bet! There's a new movie coming out today and I<br/>wouldn't miss its premiere for the WORLD!")
('Chignon', 'The only problem is it starts really, really late.')
('Chignon', "I'm not sure what I'll do to pass the time. Maybe I<br/>should watch Golden Blood for the fifth time?")
('Chignon', "Or maybe I should just wait for the uncut version<br/>everyone's been raving about to come out. Hmm...")
('Chignon', "What do you think, Agnès? What's your opinion?!")
('Agnès', "Ahaha... I don't think you can go wrong either way.<br/>You should do whatever you think will be most fun.")
('Feri', '(People really do like movies, huh?)')
('Van', "(For some people, it's more than just like.<br/>They outright love 'em. Those sorts of diehards are<br/>called 'cinephiles.')")
('Chignon', 'Oh, yeah! Did you hear the big news, Agnès?!<br/>The Messeldam Film Festival got canceled.')
('Chignon', "But they're planning a different one down south over<br/>in Tharbad! Isn't that great?!")
('Chignon', "Aaaah, I'm so EXCITED for it! I hope that one<br/>actually works out! I'm dying for something, anything<br/>over here!")
('Agnès', "Wow. They're doing something all the way down<br/>there, too? Huh... I had no idea.")
('Van', "It's not supposed to be for a little while yet. But yeah,<br/>fingers crossed it goes off without a hitch.")
('Feri', "(Heehee. The more you guys talk about movies, the<br/>more curious you're making me! I've gotta see one!)")
('Barker Tracey', 'So many people from out of town today! I love it!')
('Barker Tracey', "Now to just find some folks who'll appreciate our<br/>kind of a fun time.")
('Barker Tracey', "Don't be shy, everyone! Bondage sessions are free for<br/>the festival! No better way to enjoy today than with<br/>some tight ropes, if you ask me!")
('Barker Tracey', "Well, look at you! I'm sure a good-looking guy like<br/>yourself could use some equally-attractive company!")
('Barker Tracey', "Hear me out! I can take you somewhere with a lot of<br/>gorgeous girls! They'd absolutely love to have you!<br/>You in, pal?")
('Van', 'Oh, you must be a barker.')
('Van', "Sorry—I ain't in the mood for anything like that.<br/>Go try your luck on someone else.")
('Barker Tracey', "Wow! Cool as a cucumber, even when he's shooting<br/>me down. The girls'd go crazy over you!")
('Barker Tracey', 'Well, when you are in the mood, come talk to me,<br/>my man. I can set you up with our VIP package!')
('Van', "(There aren't supposed to be any adult businesses<br/>around here, but I guess that doesn't mean there can't<br/>be some operatin' under the radar.)")
('Barker Tracey', "If there's one thing our girls have got, it's<br/>amazing hips!")
('Barker Tracey', 'They know how to twist and move them juuust right!<br/>And the sounds that they make with those silky<br/>smooth voices of theirs... Mm-mm!')
('Barker Tracey', "You've gotta experience it for yourself, my man!<br/>And I'm not just saying that to get you in the door—I<br/>mean it!")
('Agnès', "Everything looks so delicious! I knew you wouldn't let<br/>us down, Van.")
('Agnès', "If there's anything urgent you have to take care of<br/>first, don't worry about me! You can focus on that.")
('Agnès', "I'm excited to go sweets hunting with you around<br/>town, though.")
('Agnès', "After all, I can't imagine there's anyone better at it in<br/>all of Edith than you, Van, heehee.")
('Agnès', 'I had a lot of fun checking in on the other<br/>students earlier. The city is so alive today!')
('Agnès', "Of course, I'm here to help you and everyone else<br/>with any work that comes up, too.")
('Agnès', "If you need to bring me in, that's okay. Just come talk<br/>to me anytime.")
('Van', "Got'cha. Will do. Thanks for being so<br/>flexible, Agnès.")
('Aaron', 'Hey. Been keeping busy with those patrols?')
('Van', "About as busy as you've been with that drinking,<br/>it seems. I thought you would've made a beeline for<br/>the Blacklight District or something.")
('Aaron', "You know me too damn well at this point. Yeah, I'd<br/>be down there right now if it weren't for what Cao<br/>and the rest said earlier.")
('Aaron', "We're finally about to close in on A after all this<br/>time, the bastards.")
('Aaron', "Once we know what their end-game is, all we have to<br/>do is move in and crush 'em.")
('Van', "Hey now. Don't get too ahead of yourself, all right?")
('Van', "Once they know somethin', I'm sure they'll be<br/>in touch. I know we don't have the most fun job in<br/>the meantime, but it is what it is.")
('Aaron', "You've got that right.")
('Aaron', "...Don't get me wrong, chief. I know trying to rush<br/>things is just asking for trouble. I can be hotheaded,<br/>but I'm not an idiot.")
('Aaron', "Think I'm gonna order some food, too. Make sure<br/>I'm recharged when it's time for us to go in and kick<br/>A's and the Gardens' asses.")
('Aaron', "What do you say? Any way I can get you to treat your<br/>lackey to a little something extra? Promise I won't call<br/>you an old man for five minutes.")
('Van', "Sorry, punk. I ain't made of money. You'll have to pay<br/>for whatever you want on your own mira.")
('Aaron', "Today's been a hell of a crazy day, but at least we got<br/>enough out of it to make all that bullshit worth it.")
('Aaron', "Think I'm gonna order some food. Make sure I'm<br/>really recharged for whatever's coming up next.")
('Abby', "It's over. Everything's ruined. The festival, the<br/>EGC, everything...")
('Abby', "I wish I could help like some of the others, but it's not<br/>like I have anything to offer at a time like this.")
('Abby', '*sigh* Just when I thought my luck was turning up<br/>with that lottery, this had to happen.')
('Abby', "*pant* *pant* I... I think I'm finally starting to make<br/>sense of everything.")
('Abby', "Wait. Now that I'm looking at things outside, doesn't<br/>it seem like things have calmed down? Or am I<br/>imagining things?")
('Abby', 'Just when I thought things were finally starting to<br/>make sense, more crazy stuff happens?! Give a girl<br/>a break!')
('Abby', 'EEEEEEK! Wh-What are those monsters?!')
('Abby', "I don't get what's going on. Some people can't seem<br/>to move at all.")
('Abby', 'Oh, no! I forgot! The EGC! Are they still gonna be<br/>able to hold it this year after all this? Is that<br/>even possible?!')
('Abby', "Heehee! Tonight's the EGC! I've been so excited<br/>for it!")
('Abby', "No Revolution Festival's complete without<br/>that show to cap things off, if you ask me!")
('Abby', "And I get to see it in person this year, too! Isn't<br/>that amazing?! I'm gonna pay attention to everything<br/>and sear it into my brain so I don't forget!")
('Abby', "I still can't believe I won the lottery to visit the EGC.<br/>I've only ever been able to watch the live broadcasts.<br/>This is a dream come true!")
('Abby', "No way... I won the lottery to go see the EGC.<br/>The odds are so low, I only entered for fun. I didn't<br/>think I was going to win it!")
('Abby', "Aaah, I'm gonna get to see the EGC live and<br/>in person! Maybe my luck's not so rotten after all!")
('Abby', "Aidios must've decided to show me a little mercy after<br/>not getting anywhere with attracting scouts!<br/>Oh, thank you, Goddess! Thank you!")
('Abby', "I'm glad they lifted the state of emergency. I can't<br/>believe the president of the Quincy Company was<br/>behind everything, though!")
('Abby', "I always wanted to try his company's sweets at least<br/>once, but now the thought of them just makes<br/>me gag! Ugh!")
('Abby', "Also, isn't Elaine Auclair related to them somehow?<br/>I think I remember reading something about it<br/>before, but I forget what.")
('Abby', "How...? How can a whole village just...vanish?<br/>S-Someone tell me it's all just some elaborate ad<br/>campaign for a movie. It has to be, right?")
('Abby', "Come on... Somebody tell me it's all just a bad<br/>joke already. How could something so terrible happen<br/>in my own lifetime...?")
('Abby', 'Huh?! Maxim did WHAT to Judith Lanster?!')
('Abby', 'I knew people said he was a womanizer, but I thought<br/>he was still a good guy deep down. Guess not. What<br/>a bummer...')
('Abby', "Maybe it's just a bunch of haters trying to spread lies<br/>about him. Hmm... No, probably not. I feel so<br/>let down. *sigh*")
('Abby', 'I heard some new idol group debuted around here.')
('Abby', 'It sounds like they perform over at Riverside.<br/>Groups like that are definitely in vogue these days.')
('Abby', "Maybe it's a sign that instead of trying to get scouted<br/>for modeling, I should try to get an idol scout's<br/>attention? Hmm...")
('Abby', "If there's one movie star continuing to get attention at<br/>film festivals, it's definitely Nina Fenly.")
('Abby', "You don't have to take my word for it. All the<br/>magazines are talking about how quickly she's<br/>overtaking more experienced actors! She's big!")
('Abby', "Guys seem to like Lapharl Aznavour more.<br/>He starred in Wolves' Requiem. But me? I love that<br/>racecar driver Maxim Lugan!")
('Abby', "Speaking of him, didn't he make a guest appearance<br/>in some movie? I've gotta go see it! I can never get<br/>enough of him in my life!")
('Abby', "The entertainment industry's changing so much!<br/>It's not just made up of actors these days. Now even<br/>idols and fashion models are part of it!")
('Abby', "The lines are blurring, too. Just look at trendy<br/>actresses like Judith Lanster. She's so popular, she's<br/>practically an idol in her own right!")
('Abby', 'It takes all kinds these days. If I can just find<br/>something that works for me and make it stick,<br/>maybe, just maybe, I can break in, too!')
('Abby', "(Come on, mister! You've gotta be a scout!<br/>Notice me, already!)")
('Abby', "(You can't ignore such hotness when it's right in front<br/>of you! I've been walking past you for three<br/>weeks now! MAKE YOUR MOVE, ALREADY!)")
('Shakar', "I'm so relieved. I've been able to confirm that<br/>everyone's safe. My coworkers, the EGC stuff, San,<br/>Marilyn, everyone.")
('Shakar', "I'd run over to all of them right now if I could, but I<br/>don't want to get in the way of the police and<br/>the bracers. That's the last thing I want.")
('Shakar', "So instead, for now, I think I'll try and focus on what<br/>I can do to help around here.")
('Shakar', "I've got a trained eye thanks to my job. I'll keep a<br/>lookout for anything fishy coming in from afar and if<br/>I find anything, I'll let the cops know.")
('Shakar', "I'm... I'm speechless. Who would ever imagine that<br/>the Revolution Festival would go so terribly wrong?")
('Shakar', "Even if we're past the worst of it now, I can't help but<br/>worry what's going to happen with the EGC.<br/>What's happened here is a travesty.")
('Shakar', "I'm worried about all of the staff, too—not to<br/>mention the girls I'm supposed to meet tonight.<br/>Hopefully everyone's hanging in there.")
('Shakar', "Another year, another lively Revolution Festival!<br/>Doesn't hurt that the EGC is coming up tonight, too.")
('Shakar', "It seems even more industry insiders from abroad are<br/>being invited to this year's event than usual.<br/>That should make it a treat.")
('Shakar', 'Another sign that this country is leading the pack<br/>more and more when it comes to both fashion and<br/>entertainment culture alike!')
('Shakar', "Really, it feels like this industry is entering a big<br/>turning point in general—one we'll be feeling the<br/>effects of for years to come.")
('Shakar', "There's something else I'm looking forward to<br/>enjoying once this year's EGC is wrapped up.")
('Shakar', "I get to sit down and talk with that San girl after<br/>we've all seen the show. I'm sure it's going to be an<br/>illuminating conversation.")
('Shakar', "I owe a lot to her friend for making all of this happen.<br/>It's clear as day just how much she cares about San.")
('Shakar', 'When I go looking for new models on the street, I<br/>like to think I put more stock in their individuality,<br/>rather than their background.')
('Shakar', "Still, to have a friend of someone I had my eye on<br/>approach me the way she did... That's definitely a<br/>new one.")
('Shakar', "Either way, challenge accepted! Let's see if I can't<br/>draw out this San girl's potential one way or<br/>the other!")
('Shakar', "I'm relieved everything got resolved before the<br/>Revolution Festival. It means the EGC at the end of<br/>the year can go on as planned.")
('Shakar', "Which means I've got a job to do and that job is to<br/>find some outstanding models.")
('Shakar', "Specifically, some fresh blood capable of<br/>spearheading the trends next year that'll be on display<br/>at the EGC.")
('Shakar', 'Something tells me that now might be a good time to<br/>retrace my steps and search for some hidden gems in<br/>places that I overlooked before.')
('Shakar', 'Take that statue across the way. Lots of girls like to<br/>hang out there, but I wrote it off since nobody I saw<br/>made a strong enough impression on me.')
('Shakar', 'But looking at it again with a sharper focus, I do see<br/>an Eastern young woman who certainly looks to have<br/>potential just being in her element.')
('Shakar', "I'm embarrassed I didn't notice her sooner. Just goes<br/>to show that I still have more to learn about the job,<br/>even after all these years.")
('Shakar', "It's a damn tragedy what happened in Creil.<br/>Entertainment companies used to go there all the<br/>time to film things.")
('Shakar', "The industry's ties there run deep. That's probably<br/>why people within it are starting up charity efforts<br/>to help.")
('Shakar', "Who knows if there are any survivors left or if the<br/>place can even be rebuilt? I'm sure all that good will<br/>can still lead to something positive.")
('Shakar', 'The paparazzi are saying Judith Lanster and Maxim<br/>Lugan are a thing, huh? Ha! Give me a break.')
('Shakar', "When you've been in the entertainment business as<br/>long as I have, you develop a pretty good instinct for<br/>what's legit and what's total crap.")
('Shakar', "But it doesn't always take someone like me.<br/>Anyone who's been following both of their careers<br/>will tell you them getting together is a stretch.")
('Shakar', "The thing about entertainment is, you're selling your<br/>name and reputation. Unfortunately, some people<br/>make their money by misusing it.")
('Shakar', "Entertainment's a dirty industry. You're selling<br/>people's names and looks when you get down to it.<br/>Pretty rich coming from a fashion scout, I know.")
('Shakar', "The problem is, once there's a value to your name and<br/>face, people can take them and come up with<br/>whatever crap they like to make a mira.")
('Shakar', "To put it another way, gossip rags like Buzzraider are<br/>dependent on their subjects' notoriety. It's the only<br/>way they make a living.")
('Shakar', "I guess it's time for me to start focusing my attention<br/>towards this year's Edith Girls' Collection.")
('Shakar', "Basically, it's a fashion show that takes place on the<br/>night of the Revolution Festival. Huge trendsetter<br/>when it comes to next year's styles.")
('Shakar', 'As someone who recruits new modeling talent for a<br/>living, I always keep a close eye on the people and<br/>fashion they exhibit at that show every year.')
('Shakar', "Might just be my imagination, but I feel like I've been<br/>seeing more girls in school uniforms lately.<br/>Maybe Aramis is gearing up for some event.")
('Shakar', "There are plenty of girls with modeling potential,<br/>but...it's not exactly easy to get the schools to go along<br/>with it.")
('Shakar', "Not that I'm always against it. If I find someone<br/>amazing who looks like she was sent by Aidios<br/>Herself, then I'll go all-in. Absolutely!")
('Shakar', 'My friends in the entertainment business sometimes<br/>suggest that I should tour some film festivals if I want<br/>to scout out new talent.')
('Shakar', 'The thing is, I strongly prefer models who have a<br/>natural charm and attractiveness that can be refined.<br/>I think they have more to offer overall.')
('Shakar', 'Not that their advice is bad. Some people can and<br/>absolutely do recruit models at film festivals.<br/>Different strokes for different folks.')
('Shakar', 'I just know from experience the real gems that shine<br/>the brightest are the ones out there walking the street,<br/>living normal lives like you and me.')
('Shakar', "Hot damn! The local spriggan's got business with<br/>someone like me? Never imagined I'd cross paths<br/>with you guys. What can I do for you?")
('Shakar', 'Hmm... Oh, yeah. I recognize this woman.')
('Van', 'Nice. What can you tell us about her?')
('Shakar', "I work as a talent scout. She's someone I had my eye<br/>on for some time.")
('Shakar', "She used to be a fellow regular at my favorite café and<br/>we'd run into each other there often.")
('Shakar', "I tried recruiting her twice, but she turned me down<br/>both times. Said she wasn't interested.")
('Agnès', 'I see. Does that mean if we go to the café, we should<br/>find her?')
('Shakar', 'Probably not. She stopped coming about a<br/>month ago.')
('Shakar', "I wouldn't pin your hopes on finding her<br/>there, unfortunately.")
('Shakar', "Although in her defense, it's entirely possible she<br/>stopped going because of me. Maybe she just wanted<br/>to get me out of her hair.")
('Feri', 'Dang! I thought we had a good lead. What are we<br/>gonna do?')
('Shakar', 'You might still want to talk to one of the<br/>servers there. They seemed like pretty good friends.')
('Shakar', "Who knows? Maybe she'll be able to fill you in on<br/>whatever happened to her.")
('Shakar', "If you're interested, it's the McMillan Café, just<br/>over there.")
('Agnès', "I think we'll take you up on that. Thank you<br/>for sharing! Have a good rest of your day.")
('Van', 'Least we came away with something. On to that café.')
('Shakar', 'The woman in your photo looks just like this regular I<br/>used to see at the McMillan Café over there.')
('Shakar', "She seemed pretty friendly with one of the<br/>servers there. Maybe she'll be able to fill you in on<br/>whatever happened to her.")
('Shakar', '*sigh* I feel like I have a sharper eye for beauty after a<br/>good cup of coffee at the café.')
('Shakar', "I'm trying to find some new fashion talent, maybe<br/>even someone for the Edith Girls' Collection.<br/>A diamond in the rough who just needs polishing...")
('Shakar', "But everyone I've approached has been missing that<br/>'special something.' If I could just find someone with<br/>a unique edge, then I'd be in business! Alas.")
('Shakar', "Heh. You know, normally, it's my job to approach<br/>someone like you—not the other way around.")
('Shakar', "I did have my eye on you already, I'll admit. The fact<br/>you noticed must be a sign that Aidios Herself<br/>wanted us to meet.")
('Marilyn', "Heehee. You're too kind, Mister Producer.")
('Marilyn', "But you don't have to pretend. I know you're more<br/>interested in San than me, aren't you?")
('Shakar', "Damn... You're perceptive. Definitely a sharp one,<br/>that's for sure.")
('Shakar', 'Then did you contact me because you want me to<br/>recruit you along with her?')
('Marilyn', "Actually, no. If anything, I'd prefer you to focus your<br/>efforts on San alone.")
('Marilyn', 'She deserves a chance to be proud of herself and<br/>what she does. So, please... If you could give her<br/>the opportunity...')
('Shakar', "Hmm... I see. You're thinking this is what she needs<br/>to gain more confidence to step away from what's<br/>expected of her as an Easterner.")
('Shakar', "Is that what you're getting at here?")
('Marilyn', "Heehee, exactly. Seems you've not only got a good<br/>eye, but a good ear as well.")
('Marilyn', "I wanted to speak with you in order to make sure you<br/>were actually interested in San for who she is. She's<br/>got a lot on her plate, after all.")
('Marilyn', "But, I know this will be good for her. An opportunity<br/>like this will mean more to her than you'll ever know.")
('Shakar', "Well, you're not wrong. I've caught myself thinking<br/>that she has a certain beauty that transcends<br/>her background.")
('Shakar', "If I were to compare her to an actress, I'd say she's not<br/>unlike Nina Fenly. In any case, I think she's someone<br/>with a lot to uniquely offer.")
('Shakar', "Tell you what: why don't we sit down and talk<br/>sometime soon, all three of us? It'll be her call in the<br/>end, of course. But how does that sound?")
('Marilyn', 'I was just about to suggest that myself. How about I<br/>bring her around and we take it from there?')
('Shakar', 'You mean after the EGC is over? Ha! I like the way<br/>you think.')
('Shakar', "It's a deal. We'll meet right here on the night of<br/>the festival. Looking forward to good news from the<br/>two of you!")
('San', "I-I guess Chen could still be alive. But who knows<br/>where he is or what he's doing?")
('San', "He's a pretty unlucky guy, to be honest. If he's out<br/>there, I kinda think he might be in some kind<br/>of trouble...")
('San', "I fled here hoping I'd maybe run into my brother.")
('San', "But I haven't seen him or his coworker Marielle.<br/>They haven't gotten back from their interviews they<br/>were doing.")
('San', "I'm so lost. I dunno what to do...")
('San', 'I think things have calmed down outside. But Chen<br/>and Marielle are still nowhere to be found...')
('San', "I wish I knew what Marilyn's big surprise is. Oh, well!<br/>Whatever she has in mind, I'm sure it'll be fun!")
('San', "After everything that's happened recently, nobody<br/>can complain if this year's festival is a little lacking.<br/>We're lucky to still even have one!")
('San', "My brother can be so noncommittal. I think that's<br/>why people push him around and are always trying to<br/>mooch off him for help.")
('San', "He can be pretty stubborn when he wants to<br/>be, though. Maybe once things calm down with work,<br/>he'll start to change. We'll see.")
('San', "The others are right. Whatever anyone else has to say,<br/>there's no point in me doing or thinking anything<br/>different if I'm not being true to myself.")
('San', 'I feel so silly letting myself get so worked up after my<br/>brother mentioned what happened in Creil<br/>was possibly racially driven.')
('San', "It was really getting me down and I refused to let<br/>myself snap out of it and let go. I'm so glad I have<br/>Peter and Marilyn in my life.")
('San', "They don't care about my background. They just care<br/>about ME. That's... That's what I call a couple of<br/>true friends. *sniffle*")
('San', "I had no idea Peter was the son of an entertainment<br/>company president! That's so hilarious! I don't get<br/>that vibe from him at all!")
('San', "But I guess it kinda makes sense the more I think<br/>about it. That'd explain why he knows such<br/>specific stuff.")
('San', "I've gotta give him credit, though. He doesn't really<br/>brag about it or anything at all! He's a pretty<br/>good guy.")
('San', "My brother hardly ever talks about any trends with<br/>me, despite the fact that they're always changing.")
('San', "If he's gonna write for other sections of the paper, he<br/>could at least write about fun stuff for the<br/>entertainment section or something, you know?")
('San', "I like Nina Fenly, too, of course! I just think Judith<br/>Lanster is cooler, that's all.")
('San', 'My brother, Chen, works as a newspaper reporter, but<br/>he never gets to do any interviews at film festivals or<br/>stuff like that.')
('San', "The other sections drag him in to help all the time,<br/>but he tells me it's always serious stuff! I feel really<br/>sorry for him.")
('San', 'Why do people make my brother write for other<br/>sections of the newspaper so much?')
('San', "He's supposed to be in charge of the book section,<br/>but he says they have him writing about racial<br/>tensions and stuff for the news desk, too.")
('San', "Even the economy section bugs him for work! I feel<br/>so bad for him. Maybe it's because he looks like a guy<br/>who's too polite to say no to anyone.")
('San', "I was born and raised here in Edith, so I'm used to<br/>doing whatever I want without always asking other<br/>people for permission.")
('San', "People think just because I'm Eastern, I'm supposed<br/>to be 'modest' or whatever. It sucks! I'm so glad my<br/>friends these days don't think like that.")
('San', "Chen, I'm so sorry... I know I called you pathetic and<br/>nosy, but I really do love you...")
('San', "And Peter...you were never the best at reading other<br/>people's feelings. But I'm so glad you and your dad<br/>finally understood each other.")
('Marilyn', "San, hold on a second. We don't know for sure what's<br/>happened to them yet. They could still be alive.")
('Marilyn', "Actually, it sounds like there are a few people who<br/>have seen them recently. And those reporters even<br/>said they'd send a search party out for Chen.")
('San', "Wh-What's happening? There's no way this is part of<br/>the festival, is it?!")
('Marilyn', "San, I need you to calm down for a moment.<br/>Something's wrong. Darn, this is NOT the surprise I<br/>had in mind for you...")
('San', 'R-Right. Good to know... Okay... Deep breaths...')
('San', 'In... Out... *sigh*...')
('San', 'I think I feel a little better now... Wait! What about<br/>my brother? What about Chen?!')
('Marilyn', "Now that you mention it, I don't see him anywhere...")
('Marilyn', "It'd be nice if he came back, even if he wasn't done<br/>getting interviews. Hmm...")
('San', "I-I-I don't know what to do! Could he be dead?!")
('San', "Not just him! Peter could be, too! He's not here<br/>anymore, either!")
('Marilyn', 'Take some deep breaths with me, San. You need to<br/>get yourself under control.')
('San', "Hmm... We've been all over the place, but it doesn't<br/>feel like we've done enough.")
('San', "Even after being here all day, something's missing.<br/>We should be having more fun than this.")
('Marilyn', "Heehee, don't worry. I have just the thing. You're free<br/>after eight, right?")
('Marilyn', "I've got a surprise waiting for you.")
('San', "Uhh, yeah, I can hang out then. It sounds like Chen's<br/>gonna be out late tonight anyway.")
('San', "What's the surprise, Marilyn? Tell me, tell me!<br/>Don't keep me in suspense!")
('Marilyn', 'My lips are sealed.')
('Marilyn', "If I told you, then it wouldn't be a surprise anymore.")
('Peter', 'Huh? What are you girls talking about? It sounds fun,<br/>whatever it is. Fill me in!')
('San', "*sigh* Just when I thought you were back to normal,<br/>you're doing THAT again.")
('Marilyn', "You really never change, Peter. And I definitely don't<br/>mean that as a compliment.")
('Peter', "Aww, you guys! Don't give me that look again!")
('Peter', 'Man, I thought I was all over that after taking care of<br/>things with my dad. Guess old habits really do<br/>die hard.')
('Reporter Chen', "Hey, San. Came out here to hang out? Guess things<br/>really are getting back to normal if you're doing that.")
('Reporter Chen', 'I hate to do this, but I have some kind of depressing<br/>news to share with you.')
('San', "Huh? What is it? Don't beat around the bush. Spit<br/>it out!")
('Reporter Chen', "Well...starting tomorrow, I'm going to be running all<br/>over the place, getting interviews for the<br/>Revolution Festival.")
('Reporter Chen', "Then after that, I'm pretty much going to be working<br/>constantly until the end of the year because they need<br/>me to edit and help with other stuff.")
('Reporter Chen', "And as if that wasn't enough, I'm going to be stuck in<br/>Langport working even more during the Lunar<br/>New Year. It just never ends...")
('San', "Oh, that's it? I was expecting something worse.")
('Reporter Chen', '(Ouch. You could sound at least a little bummed!)')
('Reporter Chen', "'That's it'? You know that means we won't be able to<br/>spend the holidays together like we always<br/>have, right?")
('San', 'Yeah, so? I was already planning on spending that<br/>time with my friends anyway!')
('San', "Seriously, Chen. You should hurry up and find<br/>yourself a girlfriend. There's more to life than just<br/>work and your little sister!")
('Reporter Chen', "*sigh* I can't believe I've got you telling me that<br/>now, too... I don't know if I should be happy or sad<br/>that you're so grown up now...")
('San', "Edith's so lively today! We've gotta get in there and<br/>live it up, too! We can't be missing out on all the fun!")
('San', "I don't know about you guys, but when I'm around<br/>this kind of atmosphere, it gets me so pumped!")
('Marilyn', "Heehee. I'm glad to see you're back to your usual<br/>self, San.")
('San', "I mean, when you get down to it, letting my race and<br/>stuff hold me back just isn't my style, you know?")
('San', "Besides, I've got you and Peter. And Chen's back on<br/>his feet, doing what he does best.")
('San', "I feel like I'd be an awful friend to you guys and him<br/>if I let myself stay down in the dumps forever<br/>like that.")
('Marilyn', "There's the San we know and love.")
('Marilyn', "Things just aren't the same without you being all<br/>happy and full of life.")
('Peter', "Yeah, I'm glad none of that has left any scars on you<br/>or anything.")
('Peter', 'But enough serious talk! Who wants to go bowling,<br/>huh? Nothing more refreshing than knocking<br/>down some pins at a time like this, am I right?')
('San', "I'm in! Let's go!")
('Marilyn', 'Heehee, sure. I could probably use the<br/>exercise, honestly.')
('Peter', "Huh?! I knew San would be game, but you're actually<br/>agreeing with one of my ideas just like that?!")
('Peter', "I don't even know what's happening anymore.<br/>This better not be an omen that something weird's<br/>going to happen!")
('San', '...')
('Peter', "Hey, San, what's wrong? You're being really quiet.<br/>I know you're probably shocked about what<br/>happened, but this isn't like you.")
('San', "It's just...you know how my brother works for the<br/>Tyrell Times? He told me something.")
('San', "He said it might've been...racially driven. I've...<br/>I've always tried to not get wrapped up in that kind<br/>of stuff. But now...")
('Peter', "O-Oh... Oh. I'm so sorry.")
('Peter', 'Yeah, I...guess I get what you mean. Might be a little<br/>tough to just ignore it and move on this time.')
('Marilyn', "I feel so bad for you. You've fit in so perfectly here,<br/>and then to have to feel that...")
('Marilyn', "...I'll say this. It's okay to confront that stuff if and<br/>only if you're ready to. Just know you can always<br/>come to Peter and me. We're here for you.")
('Marilyn', "Whether or not you choose to do anything about<br/>these issues, you'll always be our friend. And nothing<br/>will ever change that, all right?")
('Peter', 'Yeah! What she said! I agree a hundred percent.')
('Peter', "If you ever need to just get something off your chest,<br/>we're here! It's easy to think about stuff once you've<br/>gotten it out and cooled your head.")
('Peter', "We're more than happy to give you that space, San.<br/>We'll figure it out with you! It's the least we can do.")
('San', "You guys... Thank you. I don't know what I was<br/>thinking, letting myself get so hung up like that.<br/>I'm sorry I worried you two.")
('San', 'Judith Lanster and Maxim whatshisname are an<br/>item now?! For real?!')
('San', 'Talk about eerie. What the heck happened? Was she<br/>crying about losing the best actress award and then he<br/>pounced or something?')
('Peter', "I don't know about that. I get you're shocked, but I<br/>wouldn't jump to conclusions if I were you.")
('Peter', "It was Buzzraider who broke this 'story.' They're a<br/>pretty nasty bunch. Every talent agency out there's<br/>blacklisted them for a reason.")
('Peter', "Not to mention, this is pretty sensitive stuff we're<br/>talking about here. The line between a celebrity's<br/>private and public lives is hazy.")
('San', "Huh. You actually sound like you know what you're<br/>talking about for once, Peter!")
('San', 'What gives? Did you eat something weird today?')
('Marilyn', "Oh, did you not know? Then again, Peter's not one to<br/>really bring this kind of thing up.")
('Marilyn', "Anyway, I know he doesn't look it, but his dad's the<br/>president of a talent agency. He's practically<br/>entertainment nobility.")
('Peter', "Would you knock it off about my looks?! Sorry I'm<br/>not as hot as I'm supposed to be, I GUESS!")
('Peter', "I didn't mention it before because I'm not on the best<br/>of terms with my dad. I only brought up that other<br/>stuff because I thought you two should know.")
('San', 'No way! PETER! Does that mean you get to hang<br/>out with celebrities as much as you want?!')
('Peter', "*sigh* I don't want to talk about it... Think whatever<br/>you like.")
('San', "All the fashion magazines are taking so many cues<br/>from the film festival lately. It's really obvious!")
('San', 'They keep putting out all these specials about what<br/>actresses were wearing there and stuff.')
('Marilyn', 'Definitely. I mean, it made such a huge splash. I can<br/>totally understand it.')
('Marilyn', 'Remember that article about beating the summer heat<br/>that talked about what Central Easterners like<br/>to wear?')
('San', "Yeah! That definitely looked like stuff you'd find<br/>walking around Tharbad for sure.")
('San', "Wasn't there also something else about the effects<br/>that the festival was gonna have on entertainment<br/>in general?")
('Marilyn', 'You mean the one about the entire industry becoming<br/>more active, not just movies? Yeah, I can see it.<br/>There are more idols and bands and stuff.')
('Marilyn', "It sounds like the film festival's inspired people like<br/>that to be bold and try all kinds of new things.")
('San', "Wow! There's so much out there now! Not that<br/>I'm complaining. As long as I enjoy it, that's<br/>what counts!")
('San', 'Hey, not to change topics, but did you get the<br/>impression Peter might not show up today?')
('Marilyn', "Maybe? I don't know.")
('Marilyn', "I liked the director's cut of Golden Blood.<br/>Any festival produced by Salvatore Gotti's got<br/>my attention.")
('San', 'For someone who looks so nice and mellow on the<br/>outside, you sure enjoy some pretty messed up stuff.<br/>Not just movies, too.')
('San', "I wonder how many guys out there you've<br/>completely fooled. I bet they look pretty hilarious if<br/>they ever realize what you're really like!")
('San', "Not that I think you're wrong. I like Golden<br/>Blood, too. How could I not as a Judith Lanster fan?")
('Peter', "You like Judith more than Nina even though she<br/>isn't Eastern? I guess she was in the running for best<br/>lead actress at the awards, but still.")
('Marilyn', "You know San's allowed to have tastes in people and<br/>things that AREN'T Eastern, right?")
('Marilyn', "She just said she preferred Judith over Nina.<br/>What's wrong with that?")
('Peter', "Ack! I didn't mean it like that, I swear! But...yeah,<br/>that was pretty stupid of me. Sorry.")
('Peter', 'Anyway, on a different note, I heard through my dad<br/>that for the actors going to the festival—')
('Marilyn', "Oh, San. Are you up for some ice cream? I think<br/>they're supposed to have their seasonal flavors<br/>out now.")
('San', "Yeah, let's do it! Oh, and then after that, we should<br/>catch a movie!")
('Peter', "Hey! I'm still here, you know!")
('San', "Chen! Why'd you have to finish your work so soon?<br/>I thought you were gonna be late, so I brought you<br/>some food to surprise you. What a waste...")
('Reporter Chen', 'Hey, that stings a little. I worked really hard to get<br/>out early so we could sit down and have dinner<br/>together, you know.')
('Reporter Chen', "Not that I don't appreciate what you did.<br/>Thanks, San. Wanna grab something else on the<br/>way back?")
('Reporter Chen', "Ugh. I've been so busy pitching in with the other<br/>sections in the paper. The demand for stories about<br/>ethnic tensions in Calvard is through the roof.")
('San', "Yeah, yeah, that's enough of that. Come on, Chen.<br/>Let's eat somewhere and go home.")
('San', "...Even my parents were wearing Eastern outfits.<br/>But like, we're all so much more comfortable wearing<br/>modern stuff, you know?")
('San', 'And then my brother asks me about ethnic-related<br/>stuff because of his job all the time and, honestly,<br/>thinking about all that gets old.')
('Marilyn', 'I think you should just keep doing and wearing what<br/>you like, San. Like that one look from last week. You<br/>looked AMAZING.')
('San', 'Aww. Thanks, Marilyn. Yeah, I like to think of<br/>myself as a pretty free spirit—unlike my<br/>brother, heehee.')
('Marilyn', "Yeah, you really are. And as for you, Peter, don't you<br/>have anything to say about running late? Hmm?")
('Peter', "I told you, I didn't mean to! I just slept in a bit<br/>too much. I promise, I won't let any of that<br/>happen again!")
('Marilyn', "The problem isn't just that you were late, you know.<br/>It's that you were also trying to butt into girl talk.")
('Marilyn', 'Do you have anything to say for yourself? Or is it<br/>suddenly all right for men to barge into conversations<br/>whenever they like?')
('San', "...Yeah. She's right, Peter. You were<br/>pretty insensitive.")
('Peter', "G-Gah! You've... You've got me there. I'm<br/>sorry, girls. Seriously, I am.")
('Marilyn', "The news reporter said there's lots of people out<br/>there trying to save the city right now.")
('Marilyn', 'As long as we hang in there, everything will go back<br/>to the way it was sooner or later.')
('Marilyn', "And when it does, we're all going to sit down and<br/>have that talk with San we've been planning on<br/>for real.")
('Marilyn', 'Hmm... It seems like things have managed to calm<br/>down outside.')
('Marilyn', "But I don't think we're going to be able to give San<br/>her big surprise today, unfortunately.")
('Marilyn', "Oh, well. Making sure everyone's all right comes first.<br/>Hopefully Shakar will be okay so we can still have<br/>that conversation later.")
('Marilyn', "Heehee. We're going to make absolute sure Peter<br/>learns to read delicate situations better.")
('Marilyn', 'Anyhow, it seems like we still have a few hours<br/>before our meeting with Shakar tonight. I plan on<br/>spending that time with these two.')
('Marilyn', "I'd like to celebrate both San and Peter's recent<br/>growth soon. They deserve it.")
('Marilyn', "At the end of the day, it'll be up to San whether to<br/>pursue this modeling opportunity or not.")
('Marilyn', "But I hope she does. She'll finally get recognition for<br/>living by nobody's rules but her own.")
('Marilyn', "I'm relieved to see San's feeling better.")
('Marilyn', "But I suppose it is true that things aren't always going<br/>to stay the same between us three. That's just not<br/>how life works.")
('Marilyn', "I need to start making more of an effort to understand<br/>where she's coming from. As her friend, it's the least I<br/>could do.")
('Marilyn', "I don't think it's strange for San to wear things that<br/>aren't associated with her heritage. She just wants<br/>to walk to the beat of her own drum.")
('Marilyn', "I just wish she would realize that it's okay for her to<br/>rely on us sometimes.")
('Marilyn', "I mean, we're her friends BECAUSE of how unique<br/>she is. That's why we were able to meet in the<br/>first place.")
('Marilyn', "Peter's so bad at being direct that it always gets him<br/>into trouble. When it's not making him late, it's<br/>causing problems with his dad.")
('Marilyn', "We could've put this behind us a lot sooner if he had<br/>just come out and told us what he needed to.")
('Marilyn', 'Instead, he gets all sheepish and makes<br/>everything worse... *sigh*')
('Marilyn', 'Honestly, it might be better to NOT have Peter<br/>around sometimes.')
('Marilyn', 'I mean, he can kill the mood with even the littlest<br/>things. I like him, but having to deal with the guy can<br/>be a little much.')
('Marilyn', 'Peter looked so dejected once he realized he was<br/>being ignored.')
('Marilyn', "Maybe that'll give him a little idea of what it's like to<br/>deal with someone who's insensitive and doesn't pay<br/>attention to how you're feeling.")
('Marilyn', 'Now, where should we hang out today?')
('Marilyn', "I'm going to make Peter spoil us real good for being<br/>such a jerk earlier. So, let's be sure to pick<br/>somewhere nice to eat.")
('Peter', "Man, I can't believe I let my guard down and slipped<br/>back into that old habit right as the year's about<br/>to end...")
('Peter', "Oh, well. I'm having dinner tonight with my dad<br/>anyway, so I won't be able to tag along with the girls<br/>on whatever they're doing.")
('Peter', 'Once I sat down and talked with my dad, his reasons<br/>for trying to push his business-oriented thinking onto<br/>me started to make a lot more sense.')
('Peter', "It's supposed to be 'for my own good.' Really, I think<br/>that might be all that my dad really has to share with<br/>me when you get down to it.")
('Peter', 'Really, when you get down to it, I guess he just felt<br/>like he had to do something about me not knowing<br/>what I really want to do with myself.')
('Peter', "He could've tried to be a little less...overbearing<br/>about it. Sheesh. But I guess he's not the only one in<br/>the family who's clumsy like that. *sigh*")
('Peter', "In hindsight, my dad and I haven't had any<br/>conversations like that recently at all.")
('Peter', "Man, my dad can be so awkward at times. Not that<br/>he's the only one. We've probably still got a lot of<br/>arguing in our future. Ugh...")
('Peter', "Well, if San's doing better now, maybe it's about time<br/>I sucked it up and tried to talk to my dad.")
('Peter', "We all get along so naturally with San, it's easy to<br/>forget sometimes what sort of position she's in<br/>within society.")
('Peter', "But she tries not to let any of that bother her and<br/>happily embraces people like us. It's pretty amazing<br/>when you think about it.")
('Peter', "...When it comes down to it, my problems pale in<br/>comparison to hers. Maybe it's time I sat down and<br/>really settled the score back home.")
('Peter', "Did San really not know about it? I could've sworn I<br/>at least told her once before... Huh.")
('Peter', 'I heard a lot of crazy stuff went down at the<br/>film festival. It was the first time I ever felt worried<br/>about my dad...')
('Peter', "For all the bad blood there is between us, I guess I'm<br/>not against at least sitting down and asking him about<br/>what happened. Hmm...")
('Peter', "Ugh! Man, I am so pathetic... How can I be friends<br/>with those two girls and yet so bad at reading<br/>their minds? I'm such a doofus.")
('Peter', "Marilyn knows I'm dealing with a lot of stuff when it<br/>comes to my dad.")
('Peter', 'Yet here I am, being left out in the cold while she<br/>apparently has something happy and exciting to share<br/>just with San. It sucks.')
('Peter', "Ack... My dad's company is being featured in a<br/>magazine again.")
('Peter', "It's such a peppy magazine, too. He looks<br/>completely different from the way he really acts<br/>at home. It's insane!")
('Peter', "Not saying there's anything wrong with acting more<br/>like a businessman when you're in entertainment.<br/>I just wish he didn't push his views onto me.")
('Peter', "...Marilyn's shooting some serious daggers at me.")
('Peter', "Look, I'll cop up to the fact that I messed up. I didn't<br/>think those two were having such an intense<br/>conversation and thought I could just join in.")
('Peter', "But does Marilyn really have to make me literally pay<br/>for it every time I'm a little late or I misinterpret<br/>something? I mean, come on!")
('Officer Karen', "I guess some big operation is about to get underway.<br/>I hope it works and everything goes back to the way it<br/>was before, but...we'll see.")
('Officer Karen', "Anyway, I've made contact with HQ over in Seiden,<br/>so we're here to offer our full support!")
('Officer Karen', "I don't know the details about what you guys are up<br/>to, but I'm rooting for you all! Whatever it is, it<br/>sounds like you've got an enormous job.")
('Officer Karen', "We're all in this together! We can't lose what we had!")
('Officer Karen', 'My head is spinning so much trying to<br/>process everything. I have no idea what in the world<br/>is even going on right now.')
('Officer Karen', "But that's okay. Don't worry about me. You guys go<br/>on ahead! I've got this area under control!")
('Officer Karen', "Lahad's moves are always so impressive! I hadn't seen<br/>him do martial arts for a while.")
('Officer Karen', "Truth be told, I can't help but look up to someone<br/>like that when I see they're so talented...")
('Officer Karen', "Gah! We police have GOT to get it together!<br/>We can't have a bracer outshining us!")
('Officer Karen', "Seeing as New Year's is just around the corner, once<br/>the Revolution Festival's behind us, I'm thinking I<br/>might be due for a little vacation.")
('Officer Karen', "Can't stay on top of my game as an officer for the end<br/>of the year unless I take time off to recharge while<br/>I can!")
('Officer Karen', "Now that the mafia crackdown's mostly behind us,<br/>our attention's finally starting to turn towards the<br/>Revolution Festival.")
('Officer Karen', "This country's been through a lot this year. We've got<br/>to do everything we can to ensure the people of this<br/>city can enjoy themselves safely!")
('Officer Karen', "*sigh* I had a feeling people were in a weird frenzy<br/>this morning, but I didn't think the reason was<br/>because of some celebrity scandal.")
('Officer Karen', 'Part of me wants to write all that off as just dumb<br/>noise, but...between you and me, we do have some<br/>investigators in our ranks who are playboys.')
('Officer Karen', "If someone on the force ended up on a tabloid, I'd<br/>probably take it a little more personally. We are<br/>talking about colleagues here, after all.")
('Officer Karen', "Still, I don't know if Buzzraider's doing themselves<br/>any favors by attracting so much ire. They're playing<br/>with fire, if you ask me.")
('Officer Karen', "If they end up getting raided because of something<br/>dumb they did, I hope I don't get roped into it, but<br/>knowing my luck...")
('Officer Karen', "Well, let's get this show on the road! This city isn't<br/>going to patrol itself at night!")
('Officer Karen', "We seem to be having some unsavory characters<br/>prowling around lately, but I've got them in my sight!<br/>Nothing escapes this officer's watch!")
('Officer Karen', 'After what happened in Messeldam, the Edith police<br/>are on high alert for any suspicious people or objects.')
('Officer Karen', 'If you guys uncover anything like that, make sure to<br/>at least report it to us. Understand?')
('Officer Karen', "Don't just jump the gun and try to take care of<br/>it yourselves. Terror threats are within our<br/>jurisdiction, too, you know.")
('Officer Karen', "(I always thought this guy was a gross playboy.<br/>Now that I've talked to him...it turns out he is a<br/>gross playboy. Shocking.)")
('Officer Karen', "Listen: you have our thanks for helping us arrest<br/>that scammer. We couldn't have caught him<br/>without you.")
('Officer Karen', 'But try to keep yourselves out of any shady business<br/>from now on, all right? It only makes more trouble for<br/>us police in the long run.')
('Officer Karen', 'It sounds like you guys are the ones who broke those<br/>spheres causing all the trouble, right?')
('Officer Karen', "I've got really mixed feelings about teaming up with<br/>Heiyue, of all groups, but...we have to make the most<br/>of what we have right now!")
('Officer Nancy', "Exactly. We're police officers! We can fight, too!")
('Officer Nancy', "I may be scared out of my mind and my legs are<br/>shakin' like crazy right now, but I've got a job to do<br/>and I'll do it, darn it!")
('Officer Nancy', "So all of you keep movin' forward and don't<br/>look back! We'll protect the buildings the civilians<br/>are sheltering in—no matter what it takes.")
('Van', "Well, I'll be damned. I always thought you ladies were<br/>just nosey busybodies, but you're actually makin'<br/>yourselves useful.")
('Van', "Anyway, that all works for us. We'll keep movin'<br/>while you two hold down the fort here. 'Preciate it.")
('Officer Karen', "No problem! Just take care out there. Don't do<br/>anything too crazy if you can help it!")
('Officer Karen', "I'm glad the civilians are being so cooperative and all,<br/>but let me tell you, going from the emergency<br/>declaration to the festival's got me worn out.")
('Officer Karen', "And that's BEFORE getting into how a greater<br/>proportion are expected to be coming in from out<br/>of town. Even out of the country!")
('Officer Nancy', 'Right? I wish we could get a month in between so we<br/>can catch our breath a little.')
('Officer Nancy', "I know! Once the festival's all wrapped up, do you<br/>wanna go on a vacation somewhere together?")
('Officer Nancy', "Sounds nice, huh? Just us gals wanderin' around,<br/>relaxing and shakin' off all that pent-up stress!<br/>Oh, how I need it!")
('Officer Karen', "Ugh! Don't make me think about it! Not when we've<br/>still got so much work to do...")
('Officer Karen', "But...you have a point. I could at least use a<br/>little breather. I haven't had any time to<br/>unwind lately.")
('Officer Nancy', "Then let's do it! There's no harm in a breather. Can't<br/>stay on top of our work if we don't stay on top of<br/>our zzz's!")
('Officer Karen', "I don't know what you and your agency have been up<br/>to, but it looks like the worst is behind both of us,<br/>knock on wood.")
('Officer Karen', "For our part, the police was tasked with tracking<br/>down associates of Almata—although that part's<br/>wrapped up for the time being.")
('Officer Nancy', "Y'know, Karen was startin' to worry about you<br/>when she didn't see you 'round here.")
('Officer Karen', "Hey, I wouldn't say I was worried about them.<br/>Just concerned about any complications it could've<br/>led to... That's all.")
('Van', "I'll put it like this: we certainly had our own work to<br/>do in that whole situation, too, which we've now<br/>sorted out.")
('Van', "That said, can't say I envy you guys havin' to jump<br/>straight to hunting down the remnants of those goons<br/>right after dealing with the declaration.")
('Officer Nancy', "Well, we mighta been part of the crackdown, but<br/>we didn't do all that much, ourselves.")
('Officer Nancy', "We mostly shooed off onlookers and asked locals for<br/>their cooperation when we went and searched through<br/>citizens' homes.")
('Officer Karen', "Yeah. It was the CID who handled the lion's share of<br/>things, as usual.")
('Officer Karen', "If anything, now that things have settled down, the<br/>Revolution Festival might turn out to be more hectic<br/>for us when it's all said and done.")
('Officer Karen', "Oof... I'm beat today. Is it just me, or have the other<br/>districts been calling in help more often lately?")
('Officer Karen', 'Because I swear, my shoulders and back are<br/>KILLING me more than usual.')
('Officer Nancy', "Oh, Karen! Just how old are you? You're startin' to<br/>sound like an old man, goin' on like that.")
('Officer Nancy', "Howsabout I give you a little massage, hmm? My ma<br/>tells me I've got the hands of an angel!")
('Officer Karen', "Th-That's okay, Nancy! You don't have to do<br/>all that...")
('Officer Karen', '(She sure is soothing to be around, though. I can feel<br/>my muscles loosening up already just from talking<br/>to her. *sigh*...)')
('Officer Nancy', "Hmm? What's wrong? I got somethin' on<br/>my face?")
('Officer Karen', "Haha, no, you don't. It's nothing. Thanks for<br/>the offer. I feel a little more relaxed already.")
('Officer Karen', "You're the guy who runs Arkride Solutions, huh?<br/>What do you think you're doing, dragging such a<br/>young kid around? Are you up to more 'business'?")
('Officer Karen', '*sigh* Try to keep yourselves out of anything too<br/>shady, all right? It only makes more trouble for us<br/>police in the long run.')
('Van', "I remember you. We met when we dealt with<br/>that scammer. 'Preciate you folks takin' care of<br/>things after we were done.")
('Officer Karen', "Yeah, well, whatever. You're welcome, I guess.<br/>It didn't feel like we were helping so much as getting<br/>dumped with the cleanup.")
('Officer Karen', "Just don't do anything to disturb the peace, got it?<br/>We've got enough headaches to deal with without<br/>you taking matters into your own hands!")
('Officer Nancy', "Haha! Karen's held a bit of a grudge since all<br/>that happened.")
('Officer Nancy', 'She went on about how you outdid the police and<br/>how we on the force could end up in trouble<br/>before long. Ahh, it never ends.')
('Officer Karen', "NANCY! You can't just tell them that! I said all of<br/>that to you in confidence!")
('Van', "Hey, don't worry, ladies. We'll be careful not to get<br/>either of you fired. We're not lookin' to put anyone<br/>outta business here.")
('Officer Nancy', "I managed to get in touch with district HQ. It sounds<br/>like they're startin' to bounce back and recover, which<br/>is good to hear.")
('Officer Nancy', "'Cause at the end of the day, we have one job and one<br/>job only: to maintain order and protect human lives no<br/>matter how long this madness goes on.")
('Officer Nancy', "Anyway, I have faith in you! You've managed to<br/>accomplish a lot since we first met, and I'm sure<br/>you'll come out on top again. Good luck!")
('Officer Nancy', "I can't forget that Karen and I made a promise to get<br/>out and have some fun together for New Year's, too!")
('Officer Nancy', "That's yet another reason we've gotta get this city<br/>back to normal! We all got living to do!")
('Officer Nancy', "There's no doubt in my mind we'll all get through<br/>this together. We've done it countless times before as a<br/>country, and we'll do it again!")
('Officer Nancy', 'It always makes me smile seeing so many Aramis<br/>students visit the bookstore for their studies.')
('Officer Nancy', 'Yet another reason to make sure I do my job as an<br/>officer: so those students can concentrate on their work<br/>and get done what they need to get done.')
('Officer Nancy', "A real shame you missed out on seeing Lahad work.<br/>It's an impressive sight!")
('Officer Nancy', "Y'know, there seem to be fewer low-time thugs<br/>lurkin' around the Revolution Festival this year.")
('Officer Nancy', "Perhaps they decided to hold back a little this year after<br/>the emergency declaration we had. I certainly<br/>won't complain.")
('Officer Nancy', "You can tell everyone's holdin' back this year<br/>after what happened, but people still seem to be having<br/>a good time today. I'm glad for that!")
('Officer Nancy', "Longlai is nice, yeah, but I'd prefer to take Karen<br/>to some other tourist spots.")
('Officer Nancy', "We could go to Remiferia now that the situation in<br/>Messeldam's under control again.")
('Officer Nancy', "Plus they've got real löylys out there! I'm dyin' to try<br/>one for myself! What other reason do we need to<br/>go, right?")
('Officer Nancy', "During the alert, the locals here were all good about<br/>maintaining order and followin' the rules.")
('Officer Nancy', "I'm sure we'll count on them to help us out durin'<br/>the festival, too. Which means our main focus ought<br/>to be on the tourists coming to town.")
('Officer Nancy', "Haha! Karen tries to act like she isn't bothered, but<br/>she is! It's written all over her face!")
('Officer Nancy', "Not that I mind if she is. I just wish she'd put it<br/>off to the side while we're supposed to be<br/>out patrolling.")
('Officer Nancy', "Anyway, you can be sure we'll be keeping a sharp eye<br/>out so no trouble slips past us on our watch.<br/>Can't have you guys hoggin' all the glory!")
('Officer Nancy', "You're far too serious all the time, Karen. Always<br/>so uptight! Always on high alert!")
('Officer Nancy', "How 'bout I give you a shoulder rub, hmm? Ma and<br/>Pa say I'm a real natural at it! ㈱")
('Officer Nancy', "Messeldam's police must be worried about potential<br/>terrorism if they decided to pull the plug on the film<br/>festival outright.")
('Officer Nancy', "It doesn't sound like Tharbad's force has it any easier,<br/>either, trying to provide security for it on an<br/>unprecedented scale out there.")
('Officer Nancy', "And that's on top of the spike in incidents they're seein'<br/>from the greater influx of tourists. Those poor officers<br/>can't catch a break.")
('Officer Nancy', "(I hear this guy's got a new girlfriend every month<br/>or so... Definitely somethin' wrong with him.)")
('Officer Nancy', "Heehee! Karen is nothin' if not consistent.")
('Officer Nancy', "In any case, we're out on patrol for the time bein', so<br/>if you see anything suspicious, let us know. We'll be<br/>right on top of it!")
('Porco', "This emergency hasn't been all bad. I got some<br/>people working for the theater to taste my popcorn!")
('Porco', "Not just them, either! Even people who don't usually<br/>come to my stand have been eating it and they all say<br/>they love it!")
('Porco', "I... I don't even know how to describe it. I just feel so<br/>honored to be able to bring happiness to people like<br/>this inside the theater itself.")
('Porco', "I feel like part of my dream has finally come true.<br/>I'm actually helping people with what I do!")
('Porco', 'Eeek! How could this have happened in the middle of<br/>the Revolution Festival?!')
('Porco', "I luckily managed to flee into the movie theater when<br/>all hell broke loose. But what's going to happen to<br/>everyone who's frozen outside?")
('Porco', "Who knows...? Anyway, now that I'm inside the<br/>theater, I've got to make myself useful!")
('Porco', "With any luck, this might be my opportunity to start<br/>forging a deep, lasting relationship with it! Then who<br/>knows what'll happen?!")
('Porco', "Who knows how long we'll have to stay put here, so I<br/>took the initiative to grab the food from my stand and<br/>bring it in.")
('Porco', "There's not a lot I can do in here. But if there's one<br/>thing I know how to do, it's keep people fed, and<br/>that's exactly what I'm going to do!")
('Porco', "I'm whipping up some brand new menu items for the<br/>film festival. They might not involve popcorn, but<br/>that doesn't mean they won't be great!")
('Porco', "...Although, let's be real. Nothing beats my popcorn.<br/>I still want people to buy some when they visit me.")
('Porco', 'Movies and popcorn go together like bread<br/>and butter! But nobody knew that until I came along<br/>and showed everyone the light!')
('Porco', "Hardly anyone believes me when I say that, but<br/>maybe once the foreign tourists are in town, I'll finally<br/>find some people who do. I can hope!")
('Porco', "We've seen a lot happen this past year. Even when it<br/>comes to just movies, it was an eventful year.")
('Porco', 'We got a new film festival. Gaspard Dillon passed<br/>away all of a sudden. Judith Lanster had that<br/>big scandal... The list goes on and on.')
('Porco', 'I think when people look back on this year, they<br/>might think of it as a big turning point for<br/>the industry. I know I sure will!')
('Porco', "It's good to see the city full of life again! And not a<br/>minute too soon with the Revolution Festival<br/>coming up! I've got to hunker down and get ready!")
('Porco', 'The Revolution Festival this year is going to be so<br/>big, I hear celebrities and movie industry bigwigs are<br/>going to be in this area!')
('Porco', "And when they come through here, you bet I'm going<br/>to try to sell them not just my popcorn, but how<br/>much I love the movies they all make!")
('Porco', "There might be an emergency declaration going on,<br/>but...if I don't go out and sell my popcorn, I don't<br/>make any money today. I have no choice.")
('Porco', "I'm a total nobody. Worthless, good for nothing...")
('Porco', "The only reason I'm here is because I couldn't hack it<br/>when I tried to break into the movie industry and<br/>settled on this as a compromise... *sigh*")
('Porco', 'W-Welcome to—*cough* *cough*')
('Porco', 'Dang it... I choked on some popcorn and my throat<br/>still hurts.')
('Porco', "S-Sorry about that. But...*cough*...who wouldn't<br/>choke after hearing about such a big scandal?")
('Porco', "I heard they're going to be playing Golden Blood<br/>Director's Cut again at the theater!")
('Porco', "I missed my opportunity to see it last time and I've<br/>been regretting it ever since! Now I HAVE to see it!<br/>It's my duty as a movie buff!")
('Porco', "I was so worried that the director's cut was just going<br/>to vanish into thin air after it left the theater. I'm so<br/>glad to be proven wrong. So glad...")
('Porco', 'How? How is the ice cream lady over there doing so<br/>much better than me?!')
('Porco', "If you're going to buy anything before going into the<br/>theater, why wouldn't you make it popcorn?!")
('Porco', "Everybody knows that I'm the guy who came up with<br/>the idea of eating popcorn while you watch movies in<br/>the first place! It's just not right!")
('Van', "(Maybe it's 'cause you keep tryin' to bullshit<br/>your customers. Ever think of that?)")
('Porco', "Don't think I've seen you before. Can I convince you<br/>to get a tub of popcorn with your ticket?")
('Porco', "You should really try it! Because believe it or not, I'm<br/>the guy who came up with the whole idea of bringing<br/>popcorn to a movie.")
('Porco', "I might just be a humble vendor right now, but one<br/>day, I'm going to up my own stores all over and<br/>spread the joys of popcorn far and wide!")
('Aaron', "Oh, yeah? Interesting dream you've got there.<br/>Can't say I've met anyone else like that before.")
('Aaron', 'Know what else is interesting? You being the guy who<br/>came up with that in the first place.')
('Aaron', "Because I'm from Langport and we've always a had<br/>tradition of chomping on some corn as we watch<br/>our movies. Funny coincidence, huh?")
('Porco', '*whistle*')
('Aaron', "If you're gonna try and whistle your way out of this, at<br/>least be a good whistler, dude. You suck.")
('Porco', "It's almost time for the film festival. I was really<br/>hoping to go down to Tharbad and sell some of my<br/>own popcorn there in person.")
('Porco', 'But I guess I decided too late because all the inns that<br/>I could afford to stay at are completely booked.<br/>What are the odds, right?')
('Porco', "Argh! I just want to at least take in the festivities with<br/>other movie lovers. I'm sure it's going to be one to<br/>remember for guys like me!")
('Porco', 'Not being able to go to the film festival makes me<br/>hate not being an industry insider.')
('Porco', "I started selling these snacks so that I could at least<br/>have a job that had me around movies, but look at<br/>what it's gotten me so far.")
('Porco', 'Maybe if I get somebody actually in the film business<br/>addicted to popcorn, I can convince them to take me<br/>with them. I just might try that.')
('Porco', 'You ever taken in a late-night show here, by<br/>any chance?')
('Porco', "The theater likes to put on deeper movies that you<br/>won't find during the day. It attracts a<br/>different crowd. You should try it sometime!")
('Porco', 'And if you do, make sure to take some popcorn<br/>with you! That always goes best with movies no<br/>matter what time of day you see them, day or night!')
('Porco', 'Welcome! Any chance I can interest you in<br/>some popcorn? What about a hot dog?')
('Porco', "You've gotta at least get some popcorn. You know<br/>they won't even start the movie until everyone has<br/>some, right?")
('Feri', 'Wow, really? I had no idea Calvardians did anything<br/>like that.')
('Porco', "It's true! In fact, I'll fill you in on a little secret: I'm<br/>the one who came up with it in the first place!<br/>That's right! ME!")
('Porco', "The great thing about popcorn is it's easy to eat and<br/>makes less noise than stuff like chips. Ever since I<br/>started it, it's taken off like wildfire!")
('Feri', "That's amazing! I can't believe I'm talking to the man<br/>behind all that!")
('Van', "Hate to burst your bubble, kiddo, but you can't<br/>believe everything you hear.")
('Van', "'Cause I always ate popcorn ever since I started<br/>comin' to movies as a little brat, and I sure didn't<br/>come up with it.")
('Porco', "Bah! Okay, so WHAT if I wasn't the first guy to put<br/>popcorn and movies together? Who cares?!")
('Porco', "It doesn't change the fact that popcorn makes any<br/>movie you watch at least twice as good. That's not<br/>just my opinion, either. That's just science!")
('Nami', "I'm glad my ice cream can help calm people's nerves<br/>as they're evacuating.")
('Nami', 'I never thought as an ice cream vendor that I could<br/>ever contribute in a situation like this, but it goes to<br/>show we can all make a difference.')
('Nami', "I feel like I've learned something new about myself<br/>after this whole experience.")
('Nami', "...Can't say I understand what's got the popcorn guy<br/>so excited, though. That man remains a total mystery<br/>to me.")
('Nami', 'What in the world is going on? It looked like some<br/>customers eating my ice cream were frozen, and it<br/>turns out they actually are!')
('Nami', "I was so looking forward to bonding with people over<br/>my ice cream during the festival and talking shop<br/>about sweets. Guess that's off the table...")
('Nami', 'I really hope this all goes away soon, but... Argh!<br/>I hate not being able to do anything to help!')
('Nami', "Actually, you know something weird I just noticed?<br/>My ice cream doesn't melt now after what happened!<br/>Wait... That gives me an idea!")
('Nami', "Everybody's out there working so hard right now.<br/>They need to keep their sugar levels up, and I've got<br/>just the thing that'll help!")
('Nami', "This is some crazy heat we're having for the middle of<br/>December, isn't it? Better cool off with some of my<br/>amazing ice cream!")
('Nami', 'This is great! There are so many people roaming<br/>around here today, even more so than usual!')
('Nami', 'Makes it even more fulfilling figuring out what sweets<br/>everyone likes and then seeing the looks on their faces<br/>when I choose right and they enjoy it.')
('Nami', 'The Revolution Festival coming up is sure to attract<br/>tourists from all over Zemuria.')
('Nami', 'Part of me wonders if I should tweak my lineup of ice<br/>cream and other sweets for the event to skew towards<br/>stuff that represents this city.')
('Nami', 'Actually, maybe I should try and recreate different<br/>regional flavors of ice cream from around Calvard<br/>sometime, too, to promote unity and stuff.')
('Nami', "I won't have enough time for this year, but it'd be fun<br/>to get people from those areas to try them and tell me<br/>how good it lives up to the real thing.")
('Nami', "I'm glad things have settled down now. I still can't<br/>believe it was the Quincy Company president behind<br/>all that...")
('Nami', 'That company has so much history behind it! I knew<br/>he personally had ties to nationalists and stuff, but to<br/>be in bed with the mafia...')
('Nami', "But don't let that ruin their sweets for you! It's<br/>important to remember that Quincy's management<br/>and manufacturing are somewhat separated.")
('Nami', "The president might suck, but their sweets did<br/>nothing wrong. None of this changes the fact that<br/>they're amazing and made by true artisans!")
('Nami', "Even so, I can't help but feel regret over<br/>what's happened. I ate their sweets on occasion and<br/>learned plenty of stuff for my own work.")
('Nami', 'I really hope the Quincy Company is able to turn<br/>things around and get away from the president and<br/>his family. Their sweets are as popular as ever.')
('Nami', 'Nobody should blame the sweets for what<br/>happened—or the people involved with actually<br/>making them. They were just doing their jobs...')
('Nami', 'I-In times like these, a little sugar can help calm<br/>the nerves.')
('Nami', 'Chocolate can also have a...a soothing effect,<br/>to—oww! I bit my tongue...')
('Nami', "Ahaha... So much for that sales pitch, I guess.<br/>Can't exactly sell anyone on it if I can't even keep my<br/>own head cool right now.")
('Nami', 'Love is a lot like sweets when you think about it.<br/>It comes in all kinds of different shapes and flavors.')
('Nami', "Take Judith and Maxim, or 'Maxith,' as people<br/>call them. On the outside, they might look like a<br/>really sweet, lovey-dovey sort of couple.")
('Nami', "But you can't just make a good sweet by piling sugar<br/>on top of more sugar, and my gut tells me that's<br/>exactly what those two have going on.")
('Nami', "It might give you a sugar rush at first. But sooner or<br/>later, you'll get tired of it and it'll all come crashing<br/>down with a nasty stomachache!")
('Nami', "I was so fired up to take that popcorn seller head on,<br/>but it looks like he's mostly got his eye on the movie<br/>theater and what they're playing.")
('Nami', "*sigh* He got me all revved up for nothing.<br/>Guess he's the type of guy who can cool off as quickly<br/>as he gets fired up.")
('Nami', "Not that I can complain too much when I'm clearly<br/>attracting more customers than him, so I'd still say<br/>I'm getting the last laugh.")
('Nami', "Our little competition might've turned out to be a<br/>whole lot of nothing, but putting that aside, it's<br/>actually not so bad selling out here at night.")
('Nami', "Yeah, I think I know who you're talking about.<br/>I've seen them go to McMillan Café a lot.")
('Nami', "That's about all I know, though. You're probably<br/>better off talking to the staff over there, in<br/>my opinion.")
('Nami', "Oh, but before you go! Don't you guys think you<br/>should treat yourselves to some ice creeeam?<br/>I promise you won't regret it! ㈱")
('Nami', "Maybe it's just me, but I feel like that popcorn seller's<br/>been staring at me a whole lot lately. I wonder what<br/>his deal is?")
('Nami', 'Wait a minute... Does he think of me as a rival? Is he<br/>challenging me to a vend-off?!')
('Nami', "Well, if THAT'S the case, challenge accepted!<br/>I've put so much research and effort into my sweets,<br/>there's no way I'll lose to some popcorn!")
('Nami', "I hear Langport's home to some rare and unusual<br/>sweets that originate from the East.")
('Nami', "I'd love to see them sometime, and not just because<br/>I'm Eastern myself. I genuinely want to go over there<br/>and research them.")
('Nami', "They say Tharbad and Longlai's sweets are super<br/>unique and exotic, too. Really, I just want to travel<br/>and go on one sweet journey. Literally!")
('Nami', "I might only sell ice cream and juice here, but I'm<br/>sure the colors and whatnot I'd see in different places<br/>would give me a ton of inspiration.")
('Nami', "I've heard there're these ice creams they make over by<br/>the border in Longlai that incorporate their<br/>local specialties. Doesn't that sound incredible?!")
('Nami', "If I could just find a way to try them all, maybe I'd<br/>learn some hidden secret to them I could use here!<br/>Or maybe not. But that wouldn't be so bad!")
('Nami', "Tyrell's one of the more hip and modern parts of the<br/>city, so naturally people who visit want their sweets to<br/>look 'aesthetic.'")
('Nami', 'When it comes to what I sell, people say my gelato<br/>looks great on camera!')
('Nami', "As long as people come to see the charm in<br/>well-made sweets, I don't care what brings them in.<br/>Take all the pics you want!")
('Nami', '...')
('Nami', 'Hey. You there! I know a person with a sweet tooth<br/>when I see one.')
('Nami', "Let me guess: when you order ice cream, you're the<br/>kind of man who can't decide, so he gets both<br/>strawberry AND chocolate. Am I right?")
('Van', "...That's some scary intuition you got. You're right—I<br/>was checking your place out 'cause I was in the mood<br/>for somethin' sweet.")
('Van', "But to be able to tell exactly what I like... In fact,<br/>now that I'm takin' a closer look, your place is exactly<br/>what I'm into. How the hell do you do it?")
('Nami', "Heehee! That's what happens when you gain true<br/>enlightenment in all things sweet! You get a nose for<br/>exactly the kinds of things people like.")
('Nami', "Take your blonde-haired friend there. I've got a<br/>hunch she's into vanilla and coconut!")
('Nami', 'And as for the little one...')
('Feri', "Wow! Is everyone in the city psychic like her?!<br/>That's amazing!")
('Agnès', "...I think it's just her special talent. Most people here<br/>don't have her intuition.")
('Nami', "What can I say? When it comes to what we eat,<br/>there's nothing more special than sweets. And people<br/>who love them have an aura I can't miss!")
('Van', 'You got that right. Sweet stuff is what makes life<br/>worth living.')
('Wendell', "We don't really have anything to show for it yet, but<br/>Sloth's hitting up bulletin boards on the orbal net.")
('Wendell', "As for me, I'm hoping to help the police or bracers<br/>somehow with whatever they need if an opportunity<br/>presents itself.")
('Wendell', "I might not look like much, but I've gone all over<br/>Edith on my bike. I'm sure I can show any officers<br/>around if they don't know this area.")
('Wendell', 'I think things have calmed down around here.')
('Wendell', 'They told us to stay inside for the time being, though.')
('Wendell', "I was hoping maybe I could hop on my bicycle and<br/>gather some information or something, but I don't<br/>know if I'll get to at this rate... *sigh*")
('Wendell', "Whew! That was a good call, dashing into<br/>this restaurant. I'd have been in big trouble if I didn't.")
('Wendell', 'Although...I guess rumor has it that this place is run<br/>by that Heiyue syndicate.')
('Wendell', "Don't get me wrong. I'm not one to look a gift horse<br/>in the mouth! I'm still alive thanks to this place.<br/>But I, uhh...had no idea until today.")
('Wendell', 'I completely forgot until just now, but I guess that<br/>EGC fashion show is going on today, too.')
('Wendell', 'Trion Hall over in the 3rd District was already<br/>brimming with people when I went by it.')
('Wendell', 'I happened to hear that Elaine Auclair once tried to<br/>quit being a bracer.')
('Wendell', "I guess I can see where she's coming from.<br/>It's probably a big responsibility. She has so many<br/>fans, though! They'd be let down if she ever did.")
('Wendell', "I bet it's not all bad, though. Like, the tabloids like<br/>Buzzraider haven't had anything bad to report<br/>about her. That's gotta to count for something.")
('Wendell', "When the authorities first announced the whole state<br/>of emergency, at first, it didn't really sit right with me<br/>why it was even happening.")
('Wendell', 'So I tried to go out for a ride on my bicycle to calm<br/>my nerves, only to get told off for doing that by<br/>a policeman.')
('Wendell', "That's when I realized Calvard really IS in trouble.<br/>This isn't some problem going on elsewhere I can just<br/>brush off like it's none of my business.")
('Wendell', "Sloth's always enjoyed talking about scandals and<br/>stuff for some weird reason. I remember when some<br/>boxer got arrested for doing drugs.")
('Wendell', "He kept going on and ON about it being the 'dark<br/>side of the sports world' or whatever. He<br/>was obsessed. If only I could get him to shut up...")
('Wendell', 'I just like bicycling and want to enjoy my hobby<br/>in peace.')
('Wendell', "I wish Sloth would knock it off with that kind of talk.<br/>Even if it's all just rumors, I don't want anything<br/>remotely to do with that stuff... *sigh*")
('Wendell', 'Sometimes I come across weird rumors or encounter<br/>strange things in my life.')
('Wendell', "But Sloth's on a whole other level. That guy thrives<br/>on rumors and hearsay. He can have some pretty<br/>funky, confusing things to say at times.")
('Wendell', "Don't get me wrong. It's fun being able to meet all<br/>kinds of people while cycling around...")
('Wendell', "...but sometimes I come across some pretty<br/>inexplicable things, which then gets my friend<br/>weirdly excited. I'm not a fan.")
('Wendell', 'That speech from President Gramheart was, uh...<br/>really something. Especially how he transitioned from<br/>the memorial service to revealing that new weaponry.')
('Sloth', "Ehh, who cares about all that, pal? Tell me: how'd<br/>your ride around town go now that the festival's<br/>in swing?")
('Sloth', 'You run into anything interesting out there, or, I<br/>dunno, hear any unusual rumors out there?')
('Wendell', "It's always gossip with you, isn't it...? *sigh*")
('Wendell', "Well, there're a lot of booths from the countryside<br/>over in Vantail and Auber. People seemed to be<br/>flocking to them.")
('Sloth', "That's it? THAT'S IT?! You're telling me you didn't<br/>find nothin' juicier?!")
('Wendell', "Yeah...? I don't know what exactly you were<br/>expecting, Sloth. Sorry.")
('Wendell', "They say that mafia's behind all sorts of incidents<br/>everywhere, not just what happened in Creil Village<br/>and Oración.")
('Wendell', "Apparently they had a number of businesses working<br/>under their umbrella right here in Edith, too.<br/>And they weren't necessarily on the level, either.")
('Sloth', "Yeah, and once they got exposed, you started to see<br/>empty buildings suspiciously crop up left and right.<br/>I'd hate to be THOSE real estate agents.")
('Sloth', "But what I'm more interested in is a certain sweets<br/>maker over in Oración.")
('Sloth', "If it was just a case of the president having ties to<br/>those nationalists, it wouldn't be that shocking.<br/>The guy sure loves to act like a noble.")
('Wendell', 'Yeah. But working with Almata like that...')
('Wendell', "They're not the only big company caught up<br/>with them. So was ETWS. But it sure must not be<br/>easy being Elaine Auclair right now.")
('Sloth', 'You can say that again! The whole thing just leaves a<br/>reeeal bad taste in my mouth.')
('Sloth', "Man! All this heavy stuff's getting me down.<br/>Wendell, you should go out and find something chill<br/>for us to talk about. I need me a change of pace.")
('Wendell', "*sigh* I'm not at your beck and call, Sloth...")
('Wendell', "I don't believe what's happening. This feels way too<br/>serious to be real...")
('Wendell', "They've got checkpoints all over the place. Everyone I<br/>passed on the way here looked like they were in<br/>complete disarray.")
('Sloth', "Tell me about it! Much as I love me some juicy<br/>rumors, even I'm worried. Have to wonder how much<br/>weird, baseless stuff's circulating right now.")
('Sloth', "I'm...gonna have to watch what I say from now on.")
('Wendell', "Wow. This really is an emergency if even you're<br/>trying to get your act together. The situation is what<br/>it is, I suppose.")
('Wendell', "I can't believe what everybody's saying about Judith<br/>Lanster and Maxim Lugan! That sort of gossip's right<br/>up your alley, isn't it, Sloth?")
('Sloth', 'You bet your ass, it is! There were rumors flying<br/>around that Maxim was fooling around so much, the<br/>guy had mistresses all over the place.')
('Sloth', "Nobody saw him bagging Judith Lanster, though!<br/>Makes you wonder what fate has in store for such a<br/>power couple, don't it? DON'T IT?!")
('Wendell', "Sheesh! You're practically frothing at the<br/>mouth, man. Apparently it's not so credible, so all this<br/>excitement will probably die down before long.")
('Sloth', "Dude, did you hear?! There's a dark, secret<br/>underground district and it's hidden somewhere<br/>around town!")
('Wendell', "Oh, yeah. I know all about that supposed place.<br/>They say it's a haven for criminals and mafiosos.")
('Wendell', "Everybody loves to talk about it, but there's no way<br/>such a place is real, in my opinion.")
('Sloth', 'Hey, man, you never know! What might look like<br/>your regular, everyday entertainment district could be<br/>hiding something underneath.')
('Sloth', "You have a way of bumping into those sorts of things.<br/>You sure you haven't wandered into the place by<br/>accident or something?")
('Wendell', "No, I haven't, and I don't want to anytime<br/>soon, either. Can we talk about something else?")
('Wendell', 'I heard something interesting while I was biking past<br/>the Elsaim embassy in Auber earlier.')
('Wendell', "They say Crown Prince Sherid likes to go out and<br/>talk with the general public. That's pretty unusual for<br/>someone of his upbringing.")
('Wendell', "Doubt he hangs out much with ordinary people like<br/>you or me, of course. I'd guess he's more interested in<br/>people rolling in mira like him.")
('Wendell', "Huh? What's the matter, Sloth? You look bored.<br/>I thought you'd totally be interested to hear<br/>something like that.")
('Sloth', "I mean, good for him. He's broadened his horizons.<br/>We're still talking about some schmuck... I'm only<br/>interested in rumors with some spice to them.")
('Wendell', 'All right, fine. You want to discuss the women they<br/>had at the film festival or something?')
('Wendell', "Not that I've really heard all that much, actually.")
('Sloth', "Ehh, there's nothing wrong with that. But that's not<br/>the only spice I like, you know! Sometimes I enjoy<br/>grittier material, too.")
('Sloth', "Like this back-alley business. I don't know the details,<br/>but if you leave some sorta code on a bulletin board,<br/>they clean up your problems!")
('Sloth', 'Wendell, guess what?! The cops put out more wanted<br/>posters for that cat thief woman again!')
('Sloth', "There's all sorts of rumors about her. Like how she's<br/>got a heart of gold, or how it's actually a team of<br/>thieves and whatnot. The list goes on.")
('Sloth', "Dude, I know you run into some crazy stuff while<br/>you're out bicycling. You're like a magnet for it!<br/>You ever see her around town?!")
('Wendell', "Do you have to put it like that? You make it sound<br/>like I go out of my way to attract weird things to me<br/>when I really, really don't.")
('Wendell', "But since you asked, I was out riding a couple of<br/>nights ago when I just happened to look up. I think I<br/>might've seen someone running across rooftops.")
('Wendell', "I lost sight of them immediately, though, so who<br/>knows what it was? Might've just been some monkey<br/>that got out of its cage or something.")
('Sloth', "I heard the lines are somewhat up and running again,<br/>so I checked the message boards online to see if there<br/>was anything, but it's no use.")
('Sloth', 'Most of the other users are probably frozen<br/>right now...')
('Sloth', "...but I'm not going nowhere! Somebody else out<br/>there might still be able to connect and if they do, we<br/>can trade info! Only one way to find out!")
('Sloth', "Is there nothing we can do to help? I'm trying to<br/>think of something, but...")
('Sloth', "We're just a couple of regular guys who enjoy rumors.<br/>If we couldn't even notice we were in Heiyue turf,<br/>what good are we to anybody? *sigh*")
('Sloth', "W-We're in Heiyue territory here...? Holy crap!<br/>Not that I'm complaining, mind you. I'll take it if it<br/>means staying alive, but...")
('Sloth', "Gah! How could I fail to notice when I'm supposed<br/>to be Edith's biggest rumormonger?! Oh, I tell you,<br/>I'm getting rusty.")
('Sloth', "You could say it's a sign of just how much they have<br/>their information control on lock, but still, I<br/>should've known...")
('Sloth', "The Revolution Festival's the perfect place to find<br/>lots of weird people letting loose and doing weird<br/>stuff in weird places when you least expect it!")
('Sloth', "The least Wendell could've done was run into a<br/>couple of them and report back so we'd have<br/>something interesting to talk about... *sigh*")
('Sloth', "I'd heard rumors before about just how pompous a<br/>lotta the rich in Oración are.")
('Sloth', "They might have businesses making sweets or cars or<br/>whatever, but to them, they're nothing more than a<br/>way to get themselves and their family wealthy.")
('Sloth', "Even with land and assets behind them, they couldn't<br/>care less about the businesses. That's how their<br/>weaknesses get preyed on, I bet.")
('Sloth', 'I used to be interested in just about any rumors I<br/>came across, but I guess I need to start being more<br/>careful about false info floating around.')
('Sloth', "Maybe if I see anything weird on message boards<br/>online, I'll start to either point it out or, worse comes<br/>to worst, report it. Hate to do it, but...")
('Sloth', "Man, it's been a while since we had a celebrity<br/>scandal happen that was this wild!")
('Sloth', "If we combine that with all of the other rumors, I've<br/>gotta feeling the truth will reveal itself!")
('Sloth', 'Wendell, maybe you...')
('Sloth', 'Gah! I wish I had your luck running into<br/>exciting stuff! Lemme have some of it!')
('Sloth', 'I hear plenty of rumors about people who work<br/>underground, not just Grimcat and that spriggan.')
('Sloth', "Phantom Thief B was popular for a while, plus there<br/>are all kindsa urban legends about assassins from<br/>Langport's Eastern Quarter.")
('Sloth', "Compared to people like them, the spriggan's too<br/>grounded for my taste. They're not larger than life in<br/>a way that makes them fun or nothing.")
('Sloth', "It sounds like what Wendell saw was a more average<br/>phantom thief—jumping and flying around with<br/>superhuman skill. The kind we've all heard before.")
('Sloth', "What a letdown! I was hoping he saw something<br/>so unusual it would turn everyone's conventional<br/>thinking the hell upside down. Damn!")
('Owner Charles', 'A police officer has informed me that attention is<br/>shifting towards bringing an end to this situation.')
('Owner Charles', 'I can tell simply by looking that you all are<br/>determined to make that happen.')
('Owner Charles', 'Whatever you do, please, come back alive. I wish to<br/>see you all at my café again once this is all over.')
('Owner Charles', 'This café is eternal. It has survived much since its<br/>initial founding—and one way or another, it shall<br/>survive this as well. Good luck, everyone.')
('Owner Charles', 'A-Agnès! Mr. Arkride! I am truly relieved to see you<br/>are both all right.')
('Owner Charles', 'Especially you, Agnès. I heard you found yourself in a<br/>rather dreadful situation.')
('Agnès', "Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. McMillan. Thank you so much for<br/>keeping me in your thoughts. That means a lot.")
('Agnès', "I'm doing okay now, I promise. I have Van to thank<br/>for that.")
('Owner Charles', "Do you, now? Well, I'm glad to hear that. This is<br/>certainly quite the calamity that has befallen Edith,<br/>though, hasn't it?")
('Van', 'It could be worse. With that demon sphere out of<br/>the way, the situation here in Tyrell should be<br/>pretty calm.')
('Van', "But there are still monsters wandering around, so I'd<br/>strongly advise staying inside for the time being.<br/>All right?")
('Owner Charles', "Yes, I understand. In that case, I'll work on making<br/>this a place of refuge where people can rest.<br/>For evacuees and those fighting.")
('Owner Charles', "It may not be much, but if it's a way for me to help<br/>others during this terrible nightmare, I'm honored to<br/>do it.")
('Agnès', "That sounds wonderful, Mr. McMillan. I'm sure<br/>everybody will be happy to know they can still come<br/>to your café for a little refuge.")
('Owner Charles', "I'm going to do whatever I can within the bounds of<br/>this café to provide help and support to the<br/>community during this time of crisis.")
('Owner Charles', 'Whether that means giving evacuees safety and<br/>comfort, or simply offering the police and bracers<br/>working and fighting so hard a place to rest.')
('Owner Charles', "In the meantime, all I can do is trust that this<br/>nightmare won't last forever...that a day will come<br/>when everyone can smile again.")
('Owner Charles', "Now that the Revolution Festival is upon us, I can't<br/>help but feel especially grateful to the Goddess<br/>this year.")
('Owner Charles', "Busy as the café may be, our customers' smiles always<br/>shine brightest today more than any other day.")
('Owner Charles', "Every day running this business is fulfilling, but it's<br/>this time of year that gives me the most satisfaction<br/>and makes me glad to be here.")
('Owner Charles', 'With all the customers from the countryside and<br/>abroad that we serve, I always learn new and<br/>interesting things during the festival every year.')
('Owner Charles', 'And...after such an appalling tragedy, those<br/>sentiments are only stronger this year.')
('Owner Charles', 'I must confess. Until today, I felt somewhat<br/>apprehensive going into this festival, wondering how<br/>things were going to fare.')
('Owner Charles', 'However, seeing all of these customers come in with<br/>smiling faces, it reassures me that peace has indeed<br/>returned after all.')
('Owner Charles', 'I only pray that next year is...a good year. One free of<br/>any terrible incidents.')
('Owner Charles', 'Whenever the festival draws near, people tend to find<br/>themselves more interested in the history of this café.<br/>Certainly, I myself ponder it.')
('Owner Charles', "When I think about how Sheena Dirke and her<br/>companions used to talk about Calvard's future right<br/>by that window, I feel overcome with emotion.")
('Owner Charles', 'I ended up viewing that film, Gloria, as well.<br/>Ever since then, I find I am better able to picture how<br/>this place looked and felt in those days.')
('Owner Charles', "It's given me a renewed understanding of just how<br/>privileged I am to inherit this café. I have a duty to<br/>uphold that legacy as best I can.")
('Owner Charles', 'Nothing makes me happier than to see peace return<br/>to this city so that everyone can enjoy the Revolution<br/>Festival in peace.')
('Owner Charles', "We must not take this tranquility with which we're<br/>blessed for granted. After all, we can never get back<br/>the lives that were lost in this tragedy.")
('Owner Charles', "Certainly, it's renewed my commitment to offering<br/>the people of this city a place where...where they can<br/>truly feel safe, comfortable...and content...")
('Owner Charles', '...')
('Agnès', '...Mr. McMillan?')
('Owner Charles', 'O-Oh, Agnès! Forgive me. I was simply...closing my<br/>eyes for a moment.')
('Feri', 'Were you thinking about...what happened in Creil?')
('Owner Charles', "Yes. I've had the pleasure of visiting there. To think<br/>such tragedy could befall such a warm and<br/>welcoming village...")
('Owner Charles', 'I have to carry on. Even under this declaration, I have<br/>no choice but to continue running the café. Still, I<br/>feel compelled to pray for those souls...')
('Van', "(You can tell he's trying his best to stay calm.<br/>Probably lots of people out there who've had to hold<br/>on and keep themselves together how they can.)")
('Owner Charles', 'These are not easy times, which is why it is all the<br/>more important for us to continue to offer a space<br/>where people can relax and feel safe.')
('Owner Charles', "I simply want to ease my customer's worries. I'll be<br/>continuing to pray for the souls of those we lost in<br/>Creil as well. May they rest in peace...")
('Owner Charles', "It can't be easy being famous. I couldn't say whether<br/>or not that article has any merit.")
('Owner Charles', 'However, what I can say is that when Judith visited<br/>our café some time ago, she was pleasant to serve.<br/>A perfectly normal woman.')
('Owner Charles', "Fame certainly has a way of making a victim of one's<br/>own success. It's unfortunate when it means someone<br/>can't carry on a normal life, truly.")
('Owner Charles', "Oh, you're here late. What can I serve you<br/>this evening?")
('Owner Charles', "There's a family from Elsaim that often comes to the<br/>café in the afternoon. They appear to have finally<br/>settled into the city at long last.")
('Owner Charles', "They've started telling me all sorts of things about<br/>their lives, such as Aramis' educational outing, which<br/>is nice to hear.")
('Owner Charles', "It seemed to be quite the struggle for them to get<br/>acclimated to their new environment, but these days<br/>they sound much more relaxed. I'm relieved.")
('Owner Charles', "I overheard an Aramis student discussing an<br/>upcoming educational visitation being put on by<br/>the school. I suspect that's the annual autumn trip.")
('Owner Charles', "The reception to their destination varies depending<br/>on its reputation and general circumstances.<br/>I'm looking forward to hearing how this year's fares.")
('Owner Charles', "I'm sure that come wintertime, the students will be<br/>buzzing about the school festival as well.")
('Owner Charles', "Aramis' events are always entertaining,<br/>worthwhile affairs. They're something of a seasonal<br/>institution in these parts.")
('Owner Charles', "My customers lately can't seem to stop talking about<br/>the film festival.")
('Owner Charles', "I haven't seen very many films, much to my<br/>embarrassment, so one of them ended up<br/>recommending a handful for me to view.")
('Owner Charles', "I'm thinking of watching them soon. After all, it's<br/>important to be able to carry on a good conversation<br/>with whatever interests my customers.")
('Owner Charles', "Speaking of films, we actually had a film crew come<br/>here some time ago to do some on-location shooting.<br/>'Gloria,' I believe is the title.")
('Owner Charles', 'As I recall, they were working on something about<br/>the revolution and wanted to capture the real café,<br/>given its place in local history.')
('Owner Charles', "Perhaps I'll watch it for myself. It could make for a<br/>nice opportunity to reflect on just how much this<br/>place has seen over the years.")
('Owner Charles', 'Good evening! We still have a little time before our<br/>last call, so please, feel free to take a seat and relax.')
('Owner Charles', 'I try to stay open late so that those customers who<br/>need a place to unwind after work or school can come<br/>here should they please.')
('Owner Charles', "Now that the weather is starting to turn cold, I'm<br/>looking forward to serving my customers warm,<br/>soothing cups of coffee.")
('System', 'Van handed the owner his business card.')
('Van', "Sorry to bug you when you're probably busy.<br/>We're with Arkride Solutions. Maybe you've heard<br/>of us.")
('Van', "We wanted to ask you something about a case we're<br/>workin' on right now.")
('Agnès', "We're looking for the woman in this photo.<br/>The client is her estranged older brother.")
('Agnès', 'Is there any chance you recognize her?')
('Owner Charles', 'Oh, no need to apologize. I appreciate you all being<br/>so polite.')
('Owner Charles', 'Hmm... Yes, I do recognize this woman, as a matter<br/>of fact.')
('Owner Charles', 'One of my workers could tell you more about<br/>her, however. The two of them were good friends.')
('Owner Charles', 'Look for a waitress named Lucia. Hopefully she can<br/>point you in the right direction.')
('Van', "Got'cha. Will do. Thanks for the tip.")
('Owner Charles', "Oh, why hello there, Agnès! It's good to see<br/>you again.")
('Owner Charles', 'And who do we have here with you today?')
('Agnès', "It's good to see you, too, Mr. McMillan! These two<br/>people are from my workplace. He's my boss, and<br/>she's, ah...my coworker, I guess you could say.")
('Owner Charles', "Oh, you've started working, have you? Good for you!<br/>I'm sure it'll make for a wonderful experience for you.")
('Owner Charles', "Your coworker looks like she's from the Central<br/>East, yes? You should try some of our coffee.")
('Owner Charles', "The beans we roast are quite popular and come<br/>straight from there. They're the real deal.")
('Feri', "Wow! That's awesome!")
('Feri', "Abi loves his coffee back home. I'll have to taste some<br/>of yours and see how it compares, heehee.")
('Owner Charles', "If you're looking for more information about that<br/>young woman, you'd be best served talking to one of<br/>my waitresses.")
('Owner Charles', "Lucia is her name. I'm sure she'll be able to tell you<br/>more about her than I could.")
('Owner Charles', "It's deeply humbling having so many people from all<br/>different walks of life come to this café for rest<br/>and relaxation.")
('Owner Charles', 'In fact, when the original owner still ran it, they say<br/>Sheena Dirke and her compatriots used to come here<br/>to discuss the revolution and their ideals.')
('Owner Charles', "Hopefully they're all resting by the Goddess' side<br/>these days, knowing their country is much more<br/>peaceful and her people can live at ease.")
('Kageyoshi', '...')
('Van', '(He looks more subdued than before. Maybe the<br/>furball can sense things are changing outside.)')
('Kageyoshi', '...')
('Kageyoshi', '...*HISS*')
('Owner Charles', "He's been agitated for some time now. He refuses to<br/>take his eyes off what's happening outside.")
('Owner Charles', "I suppose that's his way of trying to protect our<br/>humble café. He's a good boy.")
('Kageyoshi', '...Mraowr.')
('Kageyoshi', '...')
('Van', "Looks like he's deep in thought about somethin' in<br/>the middle of all this excitement.")
('Owner Charles', "I wouldn't put it past him. Standoffish though he may<br/>be, I would say his intelligence more than makes up<br/>for it.")
('Owner Charles', "In fact, I regard him as something of a genius.<br/>Yes, I'm quite certain he's ruminating about<br/>something or other.")
('Van', 'Spoken like a true cat dad. You sure do love that little<br/>furball, huh?')
('Kageyoshi', '...*glance*')
('Kageyoshi', '...')
('Feri', "Heehee. Looks like he's back to his normal self?<br/>Maybe?")
('Van', "(Hmm... He does look like he's mellowed out.)")
('Van', "(But I can tell that part of him's still keepin' his<br/>guard up.)")
('Kageyoshi', '...')
('Kageyoshi', '*HISS*')
('Agnès', "Looks like he's feeling tense, too. Not that<br/>I'm surprised.")
('Van', 'Yeah. Just like the cats in our neck of the woods.<br/>They can definitely sense things.')
('Kageyoshi', '...')
('Van', 'He looks real stern this afternoon for some reason.<br/>What gives?')
('Owner Charles', "Frankly, I'm uncertain. Perhaps he senses something<br/>coming that we don't.")
('Owner Charles', 'Believe it or not, he has a rather sharp intuition.<br/>Many times, he can sense trouble coming even sooner<br/>than other animals.')
('Van', "Huh... No kidding, huh? Guess it wouldn't hurt for us<br/>to stay alert, then, just in case. Thanks for the<br/>heads up.")
('Kageyoshi', '... ♪')
('Van', "That's interesting. Not used to seeing him hang out<br/>by the window all that much.")
('Feri', 'He seems really happy today, too!')
('Owner Charles', "Haha! Indeed, he does—though cats can be such<br/>fickle creatures by nature, as I'm sure you all know.")
('Owner Charles', "Nevertheless, seeing him in such high spirits always<br/>puts me in a good mood as well. I'm happy when<br/>he's happy.")
('Kageyoshi', '...')
('Van', "(Sure is fixated on the sky for some reason. Can't see<br/>anything myself, but who knows?)")
('Kageyoshi', '...')
('Kageyoshi', '...')
('Van', "(Guess he's asleep. He's so quiet, you have to get up<br/>close and personal to even tell.)")
('Kageyoshi', '...')
('Van', "Well, aren't you a talkative one?")
('Owner Charles', 'Haha. That is simply his disposition. I prefer to think<br/>of it as one of his unique charms.')
('Feri', "Oh, wow! I didn't realize this café had its own cat!<br/>That's cool!")
('Kageyoshi', '...Mrraaah.')
('Van', "That's a funky meow. Can't say I've ever heard that<br/>come out of a cat before.")
('Agnès', 'Heehee. He kind of reminds me of the cat from that<br/>one novel, now that I think about it.')
('Owner Charles', 'Actually, as it so happens, I named him Kageyoshi<br/>after that very same cat.')
('Owner Charles', 'He can be a peculiar feline, but he means well and<br/>serves as the mascot of our café, so please be nice<br/>to him.')
('Kageyoshi', '...Mrrah.')
('Lucia', 'Now that I know how the other districts are doing, I<br/>feel confident believing that my friends and little<br/>brother are going to be just fine.')
('Lucia', "Which means I've gotta focus my energy on the task<br/>at hand! Charles and everyone else are depending<br/>on me!")
('Lucia', "I hope my brother's okay... What am I saying?<br/>He's tough! He's all right! He's gotta be!")
('Lucia', "Charles is determined to help everyone around here,<br/>and I'm going to be right there with him, doing<br/>whatever he and anyone else needs!")
('Lucia', "*sigh* It just never ends. There's always more work<br/>to do!")
('Lucia', "But they wouldn't call me the part-time pro if I<br/>couldn't power through it, and power through it<br/>I will!")
('Lucia', "Besides, I'll gladly take a busy café during the festival<br/>if that means Edith is at peace again!")
('Lucia', 'Already festival time again, huh? This past year has<br/>definitely been...a mixed bag, you could say.')
('Lucia', 'Either way, I still plan on working here next year.<br/>Hopefully, my little brother will find someplace to<br/>start working, too.')
('Lucia', "I'm hopeful next year will be good. I'll have to keep<br/>working my butt off, especially so I can teach my little<br/>brother everything he needs to know!")
('Lucia', "The city might be calm again, but it won't be for<br/>long—in a good way! That's because the Revolution<br/>Festival's right around the corner!")
('Lucia', "Charles told me that the café gets hectic every year.<br/>I say bring it on! I'll show our customers what I'm<br/>made of as a part-time pro!")
('Lucia', "I've survived my fair share of busy periods at other<br/>places before. Nothing scares me! This café will be<br/>just fine on my watch come festival time!")
('Lucia', "Oh, hello. Welcome... I know these aren't exactly<br/>happy times, but feel free to stay and relax.")
('Lucia', 'If nothing else, seeing our customers smile brings me<br/>a little comfort, too, which I can definitely use right<br/>about now...')
('Lucia', "*sigh* Haha... I'm sorry. It's hard for me to stay calm<br/>in this situation.")
('Lucia', 'When I first heard, none of it felt real. But then this<br/>morning, it started hitting me and I started getting<br/>more and more scared.')
('Lucia', "But we can't let them break our spirits.<br/>Those terrorists want us to be afraid. Remember that.")
('Lucia', 'Whoa! Did Judith Lanster and Maxim Lugan<br/>really...? Really?!')
('Lucia', "Augh! No, no, no! What am I doing?! I can't be<br/>bothering customers like this! They're here to relax!")
('Lucia', "...Maybe I'll buy a copy of Buzzraider on my way<br/>home, though.")
('Lucia', "Aramis' educational visitation sounds awesome and<br/>all, but I like working here, too. You get to see all<br/>kinds of people doing fun and cool things.")
('Lucia', "And when I say 'all kinds,' I mean all kinds. We get<br/>Aramis students, foreigners, musicians. A little<br/>of everything!")
('Lucia', "That's why I can't bring myself to quit doing work<br/>like this.")
('Lucia', "It doesn't hurt that Charles, the owner, has a<br/>personality that really invites everyone to just come in<br/>and be themselves, too.")
('Lucia', "Wait! What's this about an educational visitation?<br/>They do that kind of stuff over at Aramis?!")
('Lucia', "Aww, that sounds like so much fun... I would've loved<br/>to do something like that when I was younger.<br/>*sigh*...")
('Lucia', "Ack! What am I thinking? I'm a part-time pro!<br/>That's my reality! I can't let myself get hung up on<br/>what could've been when I have stuff to do!")
('Lucia', "I've gotta focus on my job and keep my eyes on the<br/>future, especially for my little brother!")
('Lucia', '*sigh* I wish my little brother would try having a<br/>part-time job at least once.')
('Lucia', "I know his gang's not so bad or anything. But I can<br/>also tell that he wants to make something of<br/>himself, too.")
('Lucia', "I just don't see the harm in getting a job and doing<br/>both anyway. I did something pretty similar, too.")
('Lucia', "But that's puberty for you. It's hard to get kids to see<br/>eye to eye on these things.")
('Lucia', 'People tend to look down on part-time jobs, but you<br/>can actually learn a ton from them, in my opinion.')
('Lucia', "I hope my brother considers it one of these days.<br/>He doesn't have to become a part-time pro like his<br/>big sister or anything.")
('Lucia', "His perspective on things could just use a little<br/>tweaking, that's all. He's going through puberty, so<br/>I can sympathize.")
('Lucia', "You're asking if I know anything about the woman in<br/>that photo?")
('Lucia', "Wait a minute! That's Jessica!")
('Van', 'You know her? Awesome. That saves us some trouble<br/>having to explain things.')
('Agnès', "We've been looking for her. Her older brother who's<br/>estranged hired us to find her.")
('Lucia', 'She has an older brother?!')
('Lucia', 'I had no idea she had such a complicated family life...')
('Agnès', 'How close would you say the two of you are?')
('Lucia', "Pretty close, I'd say.")
('Lucia', 'Before I came here, I actually used to work at the<br/>orbal café over by the train station.')
('Lucia', "That's where we first met. We were coworkers and<br/>became friends through that.")
('Van', "Makes sense. Think we'd maybe find her there if we<br/>paid a visit?")
('Lucia', 'I doubt it. She quit working there about a month ago.')
('Lucia', 'She said she was staying within the city, but it<br/>sounded like she decided to move somewhere<br/>pretty far.')
('Lucia', "I don't know why, but she must've had some reason<br/>for doing it. The way she described it, it seemed like<br/>her hands were pretty tied.")
('Lucia', 'She was actually a regular here at this café. I used to<br/>see her here all the time.')
('Lucia', "But once it was time to move, she said she wouldn't<br/>be able to come back here any longer. I haven't seen<br/>her since.")
('Van', "And that was that, huh? With talk like that, definitely<br/>sounds to me like she had somethin' going on.")
('Agnès', "Yeah—like she wouldn't have moved if she didn't<br/>have to leave.")
('Lucia', "That's what I felt. The whole thing really bothered<br/>me, but she just smiled and brushed it off, so I chose<br/>to let it slide.")
('Lucia', "Looking back on it, I think she tried to do that so I<br/>wouldn't worry about her after she left.")
('Feri', 'Hmm... This is getting pretty complicated. Do you<br/>know where she moved to?')
('Lucia', "No, I don't, sorry. I wish I did! All I know is that<br/>she's still somewhere in Edith.")
('Lucia', "Actually... You know something? I bet Ilhan over at<br/>my old orbal café might be able to tell you what's<br/>going on with her!")
('Lucia', "He's the person who owns it. I think she went to him<br/>for advice a lot before she quit.")
('Van', "You said his name's Ilhan and he's at the orbal café...?<br/>Got it. Thanks for the tip.")
('Agnès', 'I guess we should go to Station Street next, then.<br/>Ready to go?')
('Lucia', 'I used to see Jessica get advice from the owner of the<br/>orbal café I worked at before this job.')
('Lucia', 'His name is Ilhan. He might know more about how<br/>Jessica is doing than me.')
('Lucia', "Welcome to McMillan Café! I'll be happy to get you<br/>seated wherever you like. Are you sensitive to smoke<br/>or sunlight?")
('Lucia', 'Heehee. I like interacting with customers.<br/>Probably comes from doing a lot of part-time jobs up<br/>until this point.')
('Lucia', 'The owner here, Charles, often tells me what a good<br/>job I do. Gotta keep it up so I maintain that<br/>winning streak!')
('Lucia', "I've worked at my fair share of places part time, but<br/>this has definitely been the best one to work at.<br/>The owner here is so nice!")
('Lucia', "I think my little brother is gonna join me here<br/>next year. Until then, I've gotta keep holding down<br/>the fort!")
('Khawla', "*sigh* I finally feel calm. I'd be a real mess without<br/>this café.")
('Khawla', 'The owner is so sweet. He went to the trouble of<br/>cheering us up.')
('Khawla', "I've always come to this café because it felt safe.<br/>But to know that I can come to it when I need to<br/>soothe my mind at times like this means...")
('Khawla', "It means a lot. I'm so, so grateful... *sniffle*")
('Khawla', "Oh, no! I don't want to cry! Not after all of that!")
('Khawla', "The owner did so much to help us feel better. I don't<br/>want to ruin such kindness...")
('Khawla', "For now, I'm going to stay here with my son<br/>and pray... Pray that everything will go back to the<br/>way they were before.")
('Khawla', "Those monsters out there are really scary. But I don't<br/>understand why some people across the city are<br/>completely frozen.")
('Khawla', "None of this makes sense. I... I don't know what<br/>to do...")
('Khawla', "I'm so glad to see Lolo look so happy. He got to see<br/>his friends earlier this morning, so he's on top of the<br/>world right now.")
('Khawla', "The fact we're able to walk through this festival and<br/>simply enjoy it must be a sign that we're finally<br/>adjusting to life in this city.")
('Khawla', 'Once my husband and I meet up later tonight, we<br/>plan to celebrate some more at our temple.')
('Khawla', "But in the meantime, until then, I'm simply going to<br/>keep taking all of this in with our son.")
('Khawla', 'We really have to give thanks to Arusha for keeping<br/>our son and me safe, as well as bringing peace back to<br/>the city.')
('Khawla', 'I was so scared and full of worry for a while there.<br/>The only thing that helped me keep everything<br/>together was this wonderful café.')
('Khawla', "When you're somewhere unfamiliar, having even just<br/>one place where you can calm down and relax when<br/>you need it makes all the difference.")
('Khawla', "I can't believe how worked up everybody in this city is<br/>getting over such salacious news!")
('Khawla', "Something like that would be inconceivable back in<br/>the Central East. I'm glad my son is at Sunday School<br/>at least so he isn't exposed to any of this.")
('Khawla', "I really don't want our son hearing such lowbrow talk<br/>from other people. It just wouldn't be good for him.")
('Khawla', "I've seen students in those uniforms before. I was<br/>trying to figure out if they were going on a trip, but it<br/>sounds like some sort of special visit.")
('Khawla', "I do worry about sending students off by themselves,<br/>but I must admit, I'm intrigued. We don't do things<br/>like that in the Central East.")
('Khawla', "*sigh* I'm concerned about my husband. He seems<br/>incredibly busy lately.")
('Khawla', "Unlike me and our son, he doesn't really get any<br/>chances to relax. I have to wonder if he's really<br/>adjusting to the new environment at all.")
('Khawla', "Thankfully we're able to be together on weekends,<br/>at least. But it'd be good if we were able to actually go<br/>out and do things together as a family.")
('Khawla', 'The coffee they serve here is really good. They have<br/>blends that are just like what they have back home.')
('Khawla', "Really, the whole atmosphere here is soothing, and<br/>the owner's a nice man, too. I feel like I can come<br/>here to slowly acclimate to life here in Edith.")
('Khawla', 'When my husband said we were going to have to<br/>leave Elsaim because of a job transfer, at first, I<br/>was really worried if it was a good idea.')
('Khawla', "But I think we can make this work. We found a<br/>temple, and our son's come to like the local Sunday<br/>School as well. It's hard to complain.")
('Khawla', "How could this happen on the day of the festival...?<br/>This feels just like that terrorist attack again.<br/>My head, it's...it's...")
('Lolo', "Mommy! Mommy, are you okay?! It's okay! I'm<br/>right here!")
('Khawla', "Aww. Thank you, sweetheart. You're so sweet and<br/>strong, son...")
('Khawla', "I'm worried about my husband. He's supposed to be<br/>in Trion Tower. I hope nothing's happened...")
('Lolo', "I'm so happy Mommy's feeling better. She says it's<br/>thanks to this café.")
('Lolo', "You know... I feel better, too! I'm not scared now that<br/>I'm here!")
('Lolo', 'Wooow! This café is amazing!')
('Lolo', "It's okay, Mommy. Everything's going to be better,<br/>just like before. Remember?")
('Lolo', "Those scary monsters can't come in here.<br/>Daddy's gonna be here at any time!")
('Lolo', "This festival is awesome... There weren't festivals like<br/>this in Elsaim...")
('Lolo', "There are so many people from all over the world!<br/>It's fun!")
('Lolo', "I think my Mommy's feeling better now. And so is<br/>everyone else in the city!")
('Lolo', "The lady and the priest at my Sunday School, they're<br/>so happy about the 'revo-lotion festival' that's about<br/>to happen!")
('Lolo', 'We have festivals in Elsaim, too! I love them!<br/>I wonder what festivals are like in this country...?')
('Lolo', 'Sometimes I hear those older kids in the uniforms say<br/>something about Elsaim. Why? What are they<br/>talking about?')
('Lolo', 'Are they going somewhere? They talk about other<br/>cities and countries, too. Hmm...')
('Lolo', "Mommy says the café helps her 'add-just' to our<br/>new country. That's just like me!")
('Lolo', "Everyone's so nice to me at Sunday School! This<br/>place feels just like home now!")
('Lolo', 'If the boss of this place is nice to my mommy, this<br/>will feel like home to her, too!')
('Giselle', 'The owner was nice enough to share some snacks<br/>with me, which helped relax me a little.')
('Giselle', 'But then once I stopped being hungry, I started<br/>getting angry. Angry about the perpetrators making<br/>this whole situation so indecipherable!')
('Giselle', "I mean, how am I supposed to tell if any of this is<br/>a crime?! In any case, I'm on top of it and I'll be<br/>recording everything that happens! Mwahaha!")
('Giselle', 'Gah! This is all so scary! That eerie-looking orb just<br/>appeared out of nowhere.')
('Giselle', "Those monsters are still roaming around, too.<br/>And they say this is all the mafia's doing somehow?")
('Giselle', "N-No way! That can't be true! No human could<br/>possibly pull off anything as bonkers as this!")
('Giselle', "(EEEK! Look at him! He's so cute, it's criminal! ㈱)")
('Giselle', "*sigh* Guess the festival's almost here. Everybody else<br/>seems to be excited about it.")
('Giselle', "As for me, I...can't say I'm really looking forward<br/>to it. When you're into the sort of things I am, you<br/>don't exactly have friends...")
('Giselle', "I think I'm starting to feel depressed.<br/>Maybe something big will happen during the festival.")
('Giselle', "Is that too soon for me to say after what happened?<br/>Yeah, it's probably too soon, isn't it?")
('Giselle', "If I can't bring myself to enjoy the festival, then I<br/>guess I'll just go around and buy up as many books<br/>and magazines on crime as I can find.")
('Giselle', '*sigh* Nothing like a good book on crimes to sink my<br/>teeth into! ㈱')
('Giselle', "I almost can't believe the Quincy Company and<br/>ETWS had ties to the mafia.")
('Giselle', "I mean, they're enormous companies! How could<br/>organizations as big as them have such deep ties to<br/>the underworld, right? That's crazy!")
('Giselle', "Heehee! But that's one of the fun things about<br/>reading crime stories. The best ones always have a<br/>little dissonance that betray your expectations.")
('Giselle', "Oh, in case you were wondering, the book I'm<br/>reading now is a summary of all the white papers on<br/>crime that the police put out every year.")
('Giselle', "I'm breezing straight through it, but it's still a pretty<br/>fun read, heehee.")
('Giselle', "H-How could anyone wipe out an entire village off<br/>the face of the map? That's going way, way too far!")
('Giselle', "I like spine-tingling crime stories as much as the next<br/>girl, but this doesn't give me that sensation at all.")
('Giselle', "It's hard to put it into words. I guess I'm...scared.<br/>Just scared. I wonder when things will go back<br/>to normal...")
('Giselle', "I can't believe Almata would go so far...")
('Giselle', "I thought I understood what they were capable<br/>of, but... I guess not. All I feel right now is...scared.<br/>I'm just scared...")
('Giselle', 'Phew. I finally finished reading my copy of Perfect<br/>Crimes by Perfect Perpetrators.')
('Giselle', "Ugh, I feel so strange. Why do I have this sense of...<br/>loss now that it's all over?")
('Giselle', "I wonder if they're going to put out a new<br/>edition sometime. I need to contact the publisher and<br/>find out!")
('Giselle', 'All the normies are getting up in arms about some<br/>scandal going on, but me? All I care about are crimes!<br/>The bigger, the better!')
('Giselle', "I wonder if they're going to put out a new edition of<br/>Perfect Crimes by Perfect Perpetrators sometime.<br/>I should contact the publisher about it!")
('Giselle', "When it comes to heinous crimes in Calvard, they<br/>don't get much bigger than the whole<br/>devil-worshipping cult!")
('Giselle', "They denied Aidios' existence and about a decade<br/>ago, they were going around and kidnapping kids.")
('Giselle', 'I was still just a little kid myself back then, and I<br/>remember them giving me the absolute creeps.')
('Giselle', "Just thinking about them gives me chills all<br/>over again... The kind of chills a girl can't get<br/>enough of!")
('Giselle', 'When word got out about that whole cult, it sent<br/>shockwaves across the entire country.')
('Giselle', '*sigh* This book of mine really is the best.<br/>Just thinking about them gives me chills all<br/>over again...')
('Giselle', "I'd be careful if I were you. You guys are stepping into<br/>Desire territory with what you're doing.")
('Giselle', "Of course, you're not the only ones stepping<br/>into trouble. They sure seem to be using her friend<br/>who's with them as well.")
('Giselle', "The most infamous people mentioned in Perfect<br/>Crimes by Perfect Perpetrators have got to be this<br/>'mysterious society' it mentions.")
('Giselle', 'They travel across the continent, masterminding all<br/>manner of schemes and conspiracies!')
('Giselle', 'It says that their existence was first confirmed with<br/>the incidents that took place in Liberl about five-ish<br/>years ago.')
('Giselle', "*sigh* They sound amazing, but so little is known<br/>about them, it's hard to even fantasize about them.<br/>What a shame...")
('Giselle', "When people talk about the mafia in Calvard, they<br/>often used to mean the Dolor Family. They've been<br/>infamous for ages.")
('Giselle', 'But lately, it seems another organization known as<br/>Almata has been extending its reach, too.')
('Giselle', "They were once mostly made up of white people.<br/>I hear they incite ethnic terrorism to antagonize<br/>Heiyue—since they're Eastern.")
('Giselle', "It's...honestly scary stuff. That sort of thing happens<br/>from time to time. Ugh, keep that stuff far away from<br/>me, thank you.")
('Giselle', 'I just remembered there was a group of bad<br/>guys that got arrested a while ago. I want<br/>to say sometime last year, maybe?')
('Giselle', 'They belonged to this organization that captured<br/>children to raise them as assassins. The guild<br/>ultimately snuffed that out.')
('Giselle', 'There are rumors that they were actually a subsidiary<br/>to the mafia. Can you imagine that? Pretty eerie stuff!')
('Giselle', "When it comes to criminals who've been making a<br/>splash around Edith lately, the first one that comes to<br/>mind has GOT to be Grimcat!")
('Giselle', "She targets evil corporations and corrupt officials.<br/>And she's daring, too! She sends a calling card to all<br/>her targets.")
('Giselle', "The most interesting part? They say she's not even in<br/>it for the money. She's just out to expose wrongdoing<br/>and save people who are in trouble!")
('Giselle', 'Another thing about Grimcat: she had a so-called<br/>declaration published inside a tabloid at one point.')
('Giselle', "We can't know for sure if it was written by the real<br/>deal, but...maybe she's nothing more than<br/>attention seeking? Always possible, I guess.")
('Giselle', "For someone who's supposed to be a well-intended<br/>thief, Grimcat can be on the showy side, but that's all<br/>part of her charm.")
('Giselle', 'According to my book, she also stirred up trouble<br/>during two other periods: about 24 or 25 years ago, as<br/>well as around half a century ago.')
('Giselle', "The author theorizes that maybe it's a title that's been<br/>passed down, but that sounds kinda ridiculous.<br/>It's not like we live in some comic book.")
('Giselle', 'Heehee! Do you ever find yourselves wondering<br/>about some of the most heinous criminals to ever live<br/>on this continent?')
('Giselle', 'Like, take the demon of the Eastern Quarter.')
('Giselle', "They're a legendary assassin whose activities date<br/>back over 130 years. They were even involved in<br/>Calvard's democratic revolution.")
('Giselle', "But get this: they say the demon still lives—and that<br/>they're committing gruesome murders in the<br/>underworld to this very day!")
('Giselle', "Now, I'm not sure if that's all hogwash or not, but it's<br/>fun to think about, don't you think?! ㈱")
('Giselle', 'Speaking of the demon, apparently they normally go<br/>by a codename.')
('Giselle', "I couldn't tell you what it is, though. They don't talk<br/>about that in this book, which is a shame.")
('Giselle', "By the way, the book's called 'Perfect Crimes by<br/>Perfect Perpetrators.' It's the best! You learn all sorts<br/>of neat little tidbits about crime.")
('Giselle', '(Gaaah! This little guy is SO soothing!)')
('Giselle', '(Did he come here to comfort me? How did he know<br/>I was lonely?!)')
('Kageyoshi', '...Mraowr.')
('Giselle', "(Okay, the way he meows is a little weird, but that<br/>doesn't matter. I'm officially in love!)")
('Manager Giulia', 'Renne went back to Aramis. She said she had<br/>something important she needed to take care of<br/>over there.')
('Manager Giulia', "There's not a lot I can do in this situation, but I'm<br/>still going to try my best to help everyone out<br/>however I can.")
('Manager Giulia', 'As for you guys, come back in one piece, okay? I want<br/>to keep selling more books to you all for a long time<br/>to come! Got it?')
('Agnès', "Of course. Whatever it takes, we're going to make<br/>everything right.")
('Manager Giulia', "Renne had to take off, but the other students and I<br/>are putting my store's orbal computer system to<br/>good use.")
('Manager Giulia', "I've got a solid grasp of the basics myself, so I'm more<br/>than capable of backing you up!")
('Manager Giulia', "I ordered my orbal computer with the goal of<br/>improving service at the store. I never pictured it'd<br/>come in handy in situations like this.")
('Manager Giulia', "This investment's definitely paying off, that's for sure.")
('Manager Giulia', "That Renne girl sure is amazing, isn't she? I have no<br/>idea what she's doing, but I can tell it's impressive.")
('Manager Giulia', 'I did try to study up on how to operate a computer, at<br/>least, so I should be able to help her with the basics.')
('Manager Giulia', 'The Revolution Festival always inspires people to buy<br/>biographies because they want to refresh their<br/>knowledge of what happened in the revolution.')
('Manager Giulia', "But this year, biographies on Sheena Dirke have been<br/>flying off the shelves. I think it's because that Gloria<br/>movie was such a hit.")
('Manager Giulia', "It also doesn't hurt that inventory management is now<br/>smoother than ever thanks to the new orbal computer<br/>I bought.")
('Manager Giulia', "With a little less than a month left, I'm optimistic we<br/>can maintain our positive sales trajectory through<br/>New Year's.")
('Manager Giulia', "We've got a campaign that's set to launch during the<br/>Revolution Festival. With Gloria in theaters right<br/>now, the timing couldn't be better.")
('Manager Giulia', 'The new orbal computer I bought arrived today.<br/>After I get it all set up, we can hit the<br/>ground running.')
('Manager Giulia', "The Revolution Festival's going to be a busy period<br/>for us, so the more ducks we have in a row<br/>beforehand, the better.")
('Agnès', 'Thanks for all of your help earlier! We ended up<br/>talking to Albert later like you suggested.')
('Agnès', "It looks like Curtis' problems are going to be resolved<br/>eventually, so you don't have to worry about<br/>him anymore.")
('Manager Giulia', "Oh, I'm so relieved to hear that! Thank you for giving<br/>me that update. I really appreciate it.")
('Manager Giulia', "Next time he comes into the store, I think I'll check<br/>in on him, too.")
('Manager Giulia', "I wonder what's going to happen to Curtis.<br/>I'm worried about him.")
('Manager Giulia', 'I wish I could tell you more. Albert might be able<br/>to, though.')
('Manager Giulia', "Today's his day off, but if you happen to run into<br/>him, I'd suggest talking to him.")
('Manager Giulia', 'Books on Sheena Dirke and the revolution have been<br/>selling like gangbusters the last couple of days.')
('Manager Giulia', "I'm taking it as a sign that people are staying positive<br/>and trying to look forward to the festival after<br/>everything that's happened.")
('Manager Giulia', "As tragic as the incident in Creil was, we can't stay<br/>down in the dumps forever. We have to keep moving<br/>forward, little by little.")
('Manager Giulia', "So, I've decided it's high time that this store goes all<br/>in on this orbal net thing.")
('Manager Giulia', "Maybe I'll open up a website for us. I could even set<br/>up a newsletter so people can keep tabs on all the<br/>latest happenings.")
('Manager Giulia', 'In fact, I went ahead and bought the newest orbal<br/>computer model. Now I just need to master it ASAP<br/>so I can make the most of it!')
('Manager Giulia', "I've noticed that whenever a major tragedy happens,<br/>people always want to learn all about it.")
('Manager Giulia', "I've had people coming in to buy tour and farming<br/>guides about Creil. Some people are even purchasing<br/>books about weaponry...")
('Manager Giulia', "And you know what? More power to them.<br/>There's nothing more scary than the unknown, and<br/>knowledge can help mitigate that fear.")
('Manager Giulia', 'The tabloids are selling like hotcakes here.')
('Manager Giulia', "I'm just about to run out of Buzzraider copies.<br/>It's craziness!")
('Manager Giulia', "Though I'm feeling a little conflicted about it, given<br/>the unseemly reasons behind the increase in demand.")
('System', 'When you purchase a copy of Buzzraider at the book<br/>store, the main story will advance.')
('Manager Giulia', "If you're looking for Albert, he just went home. I still<br/>don't know how he juggles his Student Council<br/>duties and his job here.")
('Manager Giulia', "I overheard him talk about a school outing he'll<br/>be doing. He sounded a little concerned about it.")
('Manager Giulia', "Heehee. I'm guessing it's because of teenager things.<br/>Hang in there, kiddo. Your boss is in your corner.")
('Manager Giulia', "Albert's such a sweetheart. I can't not want him to<br/>succeed with whatever he's got going on.")
('Manager Giulia', "I hope he doesn't take his youth for granted.<br/>You never realize how precious those early years are<br/>until they're over.")
('Manager Giulia', "That young boy from Aramis started working here<br/>this summer. I think he's on their Student Council.")
('Manager Giulia', "He's not the handiest member on staff, but he's a<br/>diligent kid with a good head on his shoulders.")
('Manager Giulia', "Although, I haven't seen him much lately, sad to say.<br/>I guess the council's got their hands full at<br/>the moment.")
('Manager Giulia', "Regardless, he's still a bit wet behind the ears.<br/>...Oh, but I mean that in a nice way.")
('Manager Giulia', "Albert's clearly living his life to the fullest, even if<br/>some days are probably better than others.")
('Manager Giulia', "It's fun to watch him do his thing. I can't help but<br/>root for him.")
('Manager Giulia', "Hey there! We're doing a promotional tie-in with the<br/>movie theater right now.")
('Manager Giulia', "Seeing as everyone's talking about the film festival in<br/>Tharbad, we're highlighting all the books and<br/>magazines we have on film.")
('Manager Giulia', "It's a mutually beneficial situation. We sell what<br/>customers want to read, and the movie theater gets<br/>more viewers.")
('Manager Giulia', 'Everybody wins! This is the best kind of ad campaign,<br/>if you ask me.')
('Manager Giulia', 'I come from a long line of merchants.<br/>Supposedly, this place used to be a trading company a<br/>long time ago.')
('Manager Giulia', 'But my grandparents converted it into a bookstore<br/>after they saw the number of book lovers in Edith.<br/>And, well, here I am, still selling books.')
('Manager Giulia', "If you've ever wondered what we do with the other<br/>floors of this building, floors two through four<br/>constitute our enormous storehouse.")
('Manager Giulia', 'Thanks to the wonders of orbal computers, we can<br/>manage an enormous inventory, which means even<br/>more books for our customers. ㈱')
('Manager Giulia', 'My ancestors were all talented businesspeople in their<br/>own right, and I, for one, intend to maintain<br/>that legacy.')
('Manager Giulia', "I'll do whatever it takes to stay one step ahead,<br/>whether that's managing our inventory with<br/>computers or collaborating with authors.")
('Manager Giulia', 'I want this store at the head of the pack.')
('Manager Giulia', 'Hi there! Welcome to Stuart Bookstore.')
('Manager Giulia', "Whether you're shopping for novels, business<br/>magazines, or reference books, we've got all your<br/>reading needs covered.")
('Manager Giulia', 'And we sell more than just books. We also have<br/>comic magazines, promotional merchandise for<br/>movies, and plenty more.')
('Manager Giulia', "If there's anything you're looking for in particular, let<br/>me know.")
('System', 'Purchase a copy of Buzzraider for 100 mira?')
('Van', "(Whoops. I'm broke as hell.)")
('Transcent', "Our company supplied us with Xiphas. They're like<br/>mobile communication devices.")
('Transcent', 'Everyone split up and went to various parts of the city<br/>to survey the damage. We now have a rough idea of<br/>how things are looking.')
('Transcent', 'Thankfully, all the big businesses and banks are<br/>untouched for now.')
('Transcent', "However, a lot of companies aren't responding to<br/>our calls. They might need help, so I'm going to make<br/>arrangements so they can get it!")
('Transcent', 'How... How can this be real? This feels like<br/>something ripped straight out of a comic book!')
('Transcent', "The sky looks all ominous, terrifying monsters are out<br/>and about, and then there's all those people who are<br/>frozen solid... It's insanity!")
('Transcent', "I'm worried about my company, but there's no way I<br/>can leave here right now. Things are too dangerous<br/>out there!")
('Transcent', 'What are the manager and those students trying to do<br/>over there?')
('Transcent', "Ugh. I'm so embarrassed. Those kids are trying their<br/>best to help, and yet here I am doing diddly squat.")
('Transcent', 'I guess I should find a way to pitch in around here.<br/>But how...?')
('Transcent', "This year's festival is looking even more active than<br/>your average year. This is bound to do good things for<br/>the economy.")
('Transcent', 'I was certain we were in for a downturn after the<br/>Creil tragedy, but if anything, the opposite<br/>has happened.')
('Transcent', "Maybe President Gramheart's speech had something<br/>to do with that. That helped me feel much more<br/>optimistic about the future.")
('Transcent', "All right. I think I've done enough talking. Time to<br/>party like there's no tomorrow!")
('Transcent', "Now that they're putting decorations out, it's really<br/>sinking in that the Revolution Festival's almost here.")
('Transcent', "It feels like people are more energized for it<br/>than usual. I think everyone's ready for some relief<br/>after everything that's gone down this year.")
('Transcent', 'As for me, I should probably do some more work, but<br/>I feel like treating myself to some reading tonight.')
('Transcent', "I'm in a festive mood—not a work-until-I-drop one,<br/>so I'm gonna kick back and relax.")
('Transcent', "Now that the state of emergency's been lifted, stock<br/>prices are rebounding. I think we have our president<br/>to thank for that.")
('Transcent', "He's been doing some wheeling and dealing with<br/>businesses—and he announced the culprit behind the<br/>attack on Creil.")
('Transcent', "I don't know what'll happen to this country once the<br/>reparation money stops coming in, but I have a<br/>feeling he's got a plan for that.")
('Transcent', "That terror attack was so much bigger than the ones<br/>that came before it. It didn't feel real to me when<br/>it happened...")
('Transcent', 'Watching those stock prices fall sent some serious<br/>chills down my spine. Brr...')
('Transcent', 'I just found out that Judith Lanster and Maxim<br/>Lugan are madly in love right now... How scandalous!')
('Transcent', "I'm not into movies or Z1 racing, but even I've heard<br/>of those two.")
('Transcent', "I think I'll pick up a copy of Buzzraider. It wasn't on<br/>my to-buy list, but I'm just dying of curiosity.")
('Transcent', '*sigh* My Verne Company work has really been<br/>piling up lately.')
('Transcent', "I'm worried about the company. The financial boost<br/>they get from reparations is bound to peter out soon...")
('Transcent', "Oh, well. Nothing I can do about that, so I'll just<br/>destress with some reading.")
('Transcent', "I bought a book titled 'Oración Credit Union's<br/>Bankruptcy: The Truth,' but I think I'm in the mood<br/>for a novel. Now, what to buy...?")
('Transcent', "So they're promoting the film festival here, huh?<br/>This store's always got something interesting<br/>going on.")
('Transcent', "I'm supposed to be researching material for today's<br/>investment briefing at the Verne Company, but I can<br/>afford to take a quick breather.")
('Transcent', "No harm in taking in a little of the festival vibe with<br/>some light reading since I can't enjoy it in person.")
('Transcent', 'Nothing like having a smoke while reading some<br/>comics after a long day at work.')
('Transcent', 'I never buy business magazines because they make me<br/>think about work. I read to unwind.')
('Transcent', "All right. It's time for me to head home...<br/>Wait, what? It's already THAT late?!")
('Transcent', 'Ugh. I always lose track of time when I get invested<br/>in a good comic magazine...')
('Transcent', "I should buy a business magazine to see what's going<br/>on with the economy. I heard there's an op-ed from<br/>Walter Huckberry this week in—")
('Transcent', "Wait. Is that a new volume of 'Tales of Bravery'?!")
('Transcent', "I haven't kept up with that series lately. I wonder how<br/>long this new one's been out?")
('Transcent', "Looks like they've put out ten volumes so far. I think<br/>I'll buy the full set.")
('Transcent', 'Crap. What am I saying? I came here to buy a<br/>business magazine!')
('Transcent', "But who says I can't buy both? I'll just pick up these<br/>comics and blast through them this weekend.")
('Receptionist Polecca', "I've heard that people are working to resolve the<br/>present crisis. We'll do our part by looking after<br/>the evacuees.")
('Receptionist Polecca', "We're just happy that we can offer refuge to people<br/>who need it.")
('Receptionist Polecca', "That being said, I know there are people out there<br/>who are hurting as a result of what's happening.")
('Receptionist Polecca', "Once this is all over, I'd like to put on a special<br/>showing for them. I think that'll help everyone<br/>feel better.")
('Receptionist Polecca', "My mind is in a frenzy right now. There's so much<br/>going on, and I'm totally overwhelmed...")
('Receptionist Polecca', 'But at least we can all use this place as a safe haven<br/>from the current crisis.')
('Receptionist Polecca', "It's like we're all in a horror movie... No, this is FAR<br/>more terrifying than any horror film I've seen!")
('Receptionist Polecca', "I'm scared, but...we'll just have to tough it out and<br/>make the best of the situation.")
('Receptionist Polecca', "We're showing a wide array of movies to<br/>commemorate the festival.")
('Receptionist Polecca', 'Why not stay and enjoy one yourself? Or you could<br/>enjoy one with that special someone.')
('Receptionist Polecca', "After all, there's nothing like taking in a good movie<br/>with equally good company!")
('Receptionist Polecca', 'Ticket sales for Gloria: Dawn of the Revolution have<br/>been through the roof lately.')
('Receptionist Polecca', "They're almost as high as the opening weekend<br/>numbers, which is kind of insane.")
('Receptionist Polecca', "It's probably because of the festival. People must want<br/>to learn more about their country and its history.")
('Receptionist Polecca', "Despite the controversy prior to its premiere, it's well<br/>regarded for its historical authenticity and<br/>political theming.")
('Receptionist Polecca', "It's a relief that Edith's back to its peaceful self.<br/>People can now enjoy our movies without fear and<br/>anxiety weighing on their minds!")
('Receptionist Polecca', "In fact, we were able to premiere Rainfall this week<br/>like we had originally planned. I'm so glad we were<br/>able to make that work.")
('Receptionist Polecca', "I hear there's been debate within the film industry as<br/>to whether studios should hold off on announcing<br/>new releases.")
('Receptionist Polecca', 'But with that whole thing behind us, I hope more<br/>films will be hitting theaters before long.')
('Receptionist Polecca', "Creil Village was a common shooting location<br/>for films. And now it's gone...")
('Receptionist Polecca', "We might not have all the facts, but one thing's for<br/>certain: it's absolutely despicable!")
('Receptionist Polecca', "At least its beauty has been preserved in film...but I<br/>know that can't replace what's been lost.")
('Receptionist Polecca', "I should mention that despite the state of emergency,<br/>we're continuing to show movies as usual.")
('Receptionist Polecca', "Some have argued that doing so is in poor taste, but<br/>we want to help keep people's spirits up in these<br/>difficult times.")
('Receptionist Polecca', "People are scared out of their minds right now.<br/>If they can come away from one of our movies with a<br/>better outlook, then we've done our job.")
('Receptionist Polecca', "This week, the film that we're premiering for our<br/>nighttime showings is Climber's Story.")
('Receptionist Polecca', "It's a documentary that recreates the events of a<br/>mountain climber's memoir.")
('Receptionist Polecca', "It was filmed on a real mountain and also features<br/>narration from the mountaineer who wrote the<br/>original story. Isn't that cool?!")
('Receptionist Polecca', "However, given that it takes place on such a<br/>dangerous mountain, I wouldn't recommend trying to<br/>replicate any of the feats captured in the movie.")
('Receptionist Polecca', "There's a rumor going around about a<br/>particular actress. It's caused quite the stir around<br/>the city.")
('Receptionist Polecca', "I don't really know much about the situation.")
('Receptionist Polecca', "We do sometimes greet the actress in question, but<br/>it's not as though we're acquainted with her.")
('Receptionist Polecca', "So I can't say whether it's true or not. We just don't<br/>know any of the facts.")
('Receptionist Polecca', "On another note, we're showing Gloria: Dawn of the<br/>Revolution this week. Shocker, I know.")
('Receptionist Polecca', "The casting of Sheena Dirke was controversial when<br/>it was announced. Some weren't keen on an Eastern<br/>woman playing the lead role.")
('Receptionist Polecca', "But any doubts were firmly laid to rest in light of<br/>Nina Fenly's acclaimed performance.")
('Receptionist Polecca', "She immersed herself in that role so thoroughly.<br/>It's little wonder she won best actress!")
('Receptionist Polecca', "We've decided to once again screen Golden Blood...<br/>Director's Cut.")
('Receptionist Polecca', "After receiving complaints about its...content, we<br/>initially put it on hold. However, we believe in<br/>freedom of expression, so it's back now.")
('Receptionist Polecca', 'As the story goes, Director Salvatore Gotti sought to<br/>make a more extreme film than what ultimately<br/>came out.')
('Receptionist Polecca', "However, after some persuasion from the film's<br/>distributor and Judith Lanster's talent agency, he<br/>dialed it back for the original release.")
('Receptionist Polecca', "We've also begun to show Midnight Memories as of<br/>this week. That film has attracted some attention<br/>among a subset of horror fans.")
('Receptionist Polecca', 'I must say, in spite of its low budget, the sense of<br/>immersion that comes from its mockumentary<br/>framing is rather incredible.')
('Receptionist Polecca', 'Some viewers have even asked if it was a recording of<br/>actual spirits that were found in the real world.')
('Receptionist Polecca', 'More and more information is beginning to trickle<br/>out about the death of President Gaspard Dillon<br/>before the Tharbad Film Festival.')
('Receptionist Polecca', 'In the immediate aftermath, details about it were<br/>suppressed, which sent the industry into disarray.<br/>Thankfully, things are subsiding now.')
('Receptionist Polecca', 'Although Vegas Films continues to be shut down for<br/>now, it looks to be only a matter of time before they<br/>bring on a new president and resume work.')
('Receptionist Polecca', "I imagine Salvatore Gotti's popularity as a director<br/>went a long way toward garnering the support needed<br/>to rebuild the company.")
('Receptionist Polecca', "At long last, Perfect Driver 2 had its big premiere,<br/>and it's already a hit.")
('Receptionist Polecca', 'The previous movie was certainly popular as well, but<br/>a certain guest appearance in this new one is probably<br/>to thank for its big reception.')
('Receptionist Polecca', "I should also mention we're now re-running Wolves'<br/>Requiem as well. That's the movie that won the<br/>award for best direction.")
('Receptionist Polecca', 'Despite only being shown at night, it is drawing in<br/>audiences as large as our daytime showings, which<br/>speaks volumes about its quality.')
('Receptionist Polecca', "Good evening! If you're wondering about our<br/>late-night showings, I'm sorry to say that we don't<br/>have any new additions for this week.")
('Receptionist Polecca', "However, you can look forward to us re-running any<br/>award winners that emerge from the Tharbad<br/>Film Festival. We'll be playing those at night.")
('Receptionist Polecca', "Simply receiving an award is monumental for a film<br/>in and of itself, let alone what kind. We hope you'll<br/>watch them once they're available.")
('Receptionist Polecca', "The Tharbad Film Festival is almost here! When it<br/>comes to award nominees, all eyes are on Salvatore<br/>Gotti's Golden Blood at the moment.")
('Receptionist Polecca', "However, Wolves' Requiem and Perfect Driver 2 are<br/>major contenders as well. The latter's guest<br/>appearance had audiences buzzing.")
('Receptionist Polecca', "It's shaping up to be a close competition, albeit one<br/>skewing differently compared to what dominates<br/>Messeldam's festival.")
('Receptionist Polecca', "Although it's not up for any nominations, I'd also<br/>highly recommend The Peony Blade, which started<br/>showing this week.")
('Receptionist Polecca', "It's a martial arts film set in an old Eastern country.<br/>That movie has attracted a large swath of fans thanks<br/>to its exotic atmosphere.")
('Receptionist Polecca', "And, in case you were wondering, an Eastern<br/>acquaintance assures me that it doesn't have any<br/>uncomfortable, prejudicial content, either.")
('Receptionist Polecca', 'Oh, yes, I remember him. He was here earlier.')
('Receptionist Polecca', "Unfortunately, he's gone now.")
('Receptionist Polecca', 'The movie he wanted to see was no longer playing<br/>today, so he left. He appeared rather dejected.')
('Van', "Got'cha. This guy's a hard one to track down.<br/>Anything else you can tell me about him?")
('Receptionist Polecca', "Certainly. Before he left, I remember him saying<br/>something like, 'This always happens to me...'")
('Receptionist Polecca', 'I also heard him mutter something that sounded<br/>somewhat...concerning.')
('Van', "Oh, yeah? What'd he say?")
('Receptionist Polecca', "I believe he mentioned feeling frustrated about losing<br/>something he'd gone to great lengths to attain.")
('Receptionist Polecca', "And that...he'd be better off putting an end to<br/>everything as soon as possible so he could finally be<br/>at ease.")
('Van', "Ah. Yeah, that definitely qualifies as concerning.<br/>Thanks for fillin' me in.")
('Van', '(That just about confirms my suspicions.)')
('Van', '(All the more reason to hurry up and find him.)')
('Van', "(Only question is how exactly does he plan to put an<br/>end to things? I guess there's always THAT...)")
('Van', "(Those things should be running at this hour. I'd say<br/>chances are good that's what he's gonna try for.)")
('Van', '(Most likely, he headed straight underground after<br/>leaving the theater. Better make a beeline for it.)')
('Receptionist Polecca', 'Good evening! You might be interested to hear that<br/>we show different movies here during the day and<br/>at night.')
('Receptionist Polecca', 'My top recommendation would be Sober Curious,<br/>which received a nomination at the Tharbad<br/>Film Festival.')
('Receptionist Polecca', "This Side of Heaven has also found a large audience<br/>despite its small budget. People love its intricate<br/>portrayal of a medical intern's struggles.")
('Receptionist Polecca', "Welcome to Esprit Cinema. If you're looking to<br/>purchase tickets, I'd be more than happy to help you.")
('Feri', "Wait, so you buy your tickets first and then you watch<br/>the movie? I never would've guessed!")
('Van', "They do that so you can reserve a seat and also know<br/>which auditorium your movie will be playing in.<br/>Pretty much like hoppin' on a train.")
('Receptionist Polecca', 'Oh, is this your first time coming to a movie<br/>theater, miss? Interesting. I thought films were<br/>becoming more common in the Central East.')
('Feri', "Well, I grew up in a pretty remote place, so I haven't<br/>seen any movies before. I heard they're like<br/>combat recordings.")
('Receptionist Polecca', "O-Oh, that's a...unique comparison. I suppose that's<br/>true, in a way. You can think of films as theatrical<br/>plays in recorded form.")
('Receptionist Polecca', 'Regardless, we certainly have films that are popular<br/>with girls your age, as well as ones that are perfect for<br/>first-time moviegoers.')
('Receptionist Polecca', "If you're not sure what you'd like to watch, please,<br/>don't hesitate to ask me. I'll be more than happy to<br/>give you a recommendation.")
('Feri', "Awesome! Thanks a bunch, ma'am.")
('Receptionist Polecca', 'Golden Blood has proven to be an especially big hit<br/>with audiences.')
('Receptionist Polecca', 'It has more than its fair share of racy scenes, but the<br/>hard-hitting action and lightning-fast pacing of the<br/>story have won scores of people over.')
('Receptionist Polecca', 'Many people have also found themselves drawn to<br/>Sober Curious due to the complex inner workings of<br/>its main character.')
('Guide Hendrick', 'I hear that a number of people are working tirelessly<br/>to resolve the ongoing situation.')
('Guide Hendrick', 'I really, truly want to believe in their success.<br/>However, the truth of the matter is, anything<br/>could happen.')
('Guide Hendrick', "Still, now that communications are restored, we're<br/>prepared to help as many evacuees as we can.")
('Guide Hendrick', 'This theater is as sturdy as it is big, thankfully.<br/>The more people we can take in, the more lives we<br/>can save.')
('Guide Hendrick', "I'm glad we've been able to take in as many people as<br/>we have. However, I'm worried about what's going to<br/>happen—")
('Guide Hendrick', "No, I mustn't talk like that. I've got to put on a brave<br/>face for everyone here.")
('Guide Hendrick', "It's our privilege and honor to serve as an<br/>evacuation hub. We'll make the most of our resources<br/>so we can all get through this together.")
('Guide Hendrick', "For the time being, we won't charge anyone for<br/>drinks at our stand. Hopefully that'll help put<br/>everyone at ease.")
('Guide Hendrick', "Every year, on the day of the Revolution Festival, we<br/>have a custom of screening that year's most<br/>popular films.")
('Guide Hendrick', "It's an opportunity for audiences to gain new insights<br/>into these movies, particularly in light of any awards<br/>they may have received.")
('Guide Hendrick', "This year's festival is slated to welcome more visitors<br/>from abroad than ever before.")
('Guide Hendrick', 'I hope that means many more people will learn about<br/>Calvard and its cinematic culture.')
('Guide Hendrick', "I should mention, we're rescreening Golden Blood.<br/>You can watch either the standard release or the<br/>director's cut.")
('Guide Hendrick', "Since it made such an enormous stir, we figured it'd<br/>make for a fine way to end this year.")
('Guide Hendrick', 'I hear that Salvatore Gotti is going to be at the<br/>Revolution Festival. Apparently, the government<br/>requested that he personally oversee the event.')
('Guide Hendrick', 'If the circumstances permit, I hope he can pay us and<br/>our viewers another visit once the festival is over.')
('Guide Hendrick', "Only a week has passed since that horrible event, and<br/>we've already amassed an astonishing amount<br/>of donations.")
('Guide Hendrick', "As soon as we announced that we'd be donating a<br/>portion of our revenue, a good number of people<br/>came to visit.")
('Guide Hendrick', 'Witnessing this level of generosity makes me feel<br/>truly grateful that I get to be a part of this industry,<br/>humble as it is.')
('Guide Hendrick', "On another note, Rainfall is premiering on schedule.<br/>I'd highly recommend watching that.")
('Guide Hendrick', "It's a heart-wrenching romantic drama with elaborate<br/>set designs and nuanced character portrayals.")
('Guide Hendrick', "Trust me when I say it's nothing short of<br/>a masterpiece. I cannot sing its praises enough!")
('Guide Hendrick', 'In light of what happened in Creil Village, the film<br/>industry will be doing charity drives to offer support.')
('Guide Hendrick', "For our part, we've decided to donate a portion of our<br/>proceeds to the cause.")
('Guide Hendrick', 'There are also proposals to memorialize the history of<br/>the village on film so that its legacy is never forgotten.')
('Guide Hendrick', 'Creil Village served as the backdrop for a famous<br/>romantic film produced during the early years of film.')
('Guide Hendrick', 'Not only did that movie spread awareness of the<br/>village, it also inspired many people to enter the<br/>industry outright.')
('Guide Hendrick', "Suffice it to say, that village left an enormous mark on<br/>a number of people. It pains me to see what's become<br/>of it.")
('Guide Hendrick', "In light of everything going on, I, unfortunately,<br/>wasn't able to offer much assistance earlier in the day.")
('Guide Hendrick', "Be that as it may, I'm happy to inform you that this<br/>week's new film is Climber's Story.")
('Guide Hendrick', "It's a quasi-documentary based on real world writings,<br/>offering a unique perspective and atmosphere you<br/>won't find in other films.")
('Guide Hendrick', "We're also continuing our re-run of Wolves' Requiem<br/>as well. If you still have yet to see it, then by all<br/>means, please do so!")
('Guide Hendrick', "*sigh* I've had a handful of chances to talk to Judith<br/>Lanster, including when she came to our theater to<br/>promote Golden Blood.")
('Guide Hendrick', 'Though I may not know her well, it saddens me to<br/>see her go through such a tremendous scandal.')
('Guide Hendrick', 'I suppose these moments come with fame such<br/>as hers...')
('Guide Hendrick', "It's becoming quite the headache for us, too. We now<br/>have people inquiring about the matter to us.")
('Guide Hendrick', "Putting all of that nonsense aside, this week's top<br/>recommendation has to be, without a doubt, Gloria:<br/>Dawn of the Revolution.")
('Guide Hendrick', "It's a biographical film about Sheena Dirke, portrayed<br/>by none other than Nina Fenly, who's sort of at the<br/>center of attention these days.")
('Guide Hendrick', "Although some objected to a person of Eastern<br/>heritage playing such a role, I'd say she was born for<br/>the part.")
('Guide Hendrick', "I'm sure you don't need me to tell you how popular<br/>Wolves' Requiem is.")
('Guide Hendrick', "We started screening that at night alongside the<br/>director's cut of Golden Blood. Though the latter has<br/>an age restriction in place.")
('Guide Hendrick', 'Director Gotti wanted that version to be screened<br/>because—in his words—it leaves nothing on<br/>the table.')
('Guide Hendrick', 'Many moviegoers also expressed interest, so in the<br/>spirit of supporting Vegas Films, we ultimately<br/>decided to show it.')
('Guide Hendrick', "I must say, when the death of Vegas Film's President<br/>Gaspard Dillon was announced, we were all in<br/>complete shock.")
('Guide Hendrick', "And that's without going into the rather dark,<br/>unfortunate rumors being reported on him as well...")
('Guide Hendrick', 'Even if his legacy is an imperfect one, I know for a<br/>fact that his passion for the Tharbad Film Festival<br/>was genuine.')
('Guide Hendrick', 'I had the chance to speak with him before he passed.<br/>His eyes lit up as he described how novel and<br/>groundbreaking the festival was going to be.')
('Guide Hendrick', "It's a miracle that the film festival was still able to<br/>proceed under such trying circumstances. I'm sure he<br/>must be pleased up there in heaven.")
('Guide Hendrick', 'Film stars have only really enjoyed this level of<br/>notoriety for a little over ten years now.')
('Guide Hendrick', 'When I see them grace the covers of entertainment<br/>magazines, they look so in their element.')
('Guide Hendrick', 'Those who have poured their hearts and souls into<br/>this industry are really being rewarded for all<br/>their efforts.')
('Guide Hendrick', "Of course, that fortune doesn't come without its share<br/>of problems, but I still hope we can realize even<br/>greater success in time.")
('Guide Hendrick', "At this theater, we never rest on our laurels.<br/>We're always devising new, interesting ways to<br/>promote this place and films as a whole.")
('Guide Hendrick', "Whether it's actors giving talks, collaborating with<br/>Stuart Bookstore, or producing pamphlets and<br/>merchandise, we're always doing something.")
('Guide Hendrick', 'We have high hopes that the Tharbad Film Festival<br/>will help give this industry some momentum.')
('Guide Hendrick', "The Tharbad Film Festival is nearly upon us. It'll take<br/>place at the end of the holiday weekend.")
('Guide Hendrick', 'Vegas Films originally conceived it independently as<br/>something of a rival festival to the Messeldam one.')
('Guide Hendrick', "Everyone's eyes are on it now, especially since the<br/>Messeldam Film Festival was canceled.")
('Guide Hendrick', 'Having Elsaim on board as a sponsor should help<br/>freshen things up as well.')
('Guide Hendrick', 'The Messeldam Film Festival places great emphasis<br/>on the artistry of filmmaking.')
('Guide Hendrick', 'As such, its judges are mainly artists and literary<br/>figures, and they award movies based on their<br/>psychological depictions and refined theming.')
('Guide Hendrick', "In contrast, I hear that Tharbad's festival values<br/>entertainment and spectacle above all else. It'll be very<br/>interesting to see how that plays out.")
('Guide Hendrick', "Good evening. Thinking of taking in a<br/>movie tonight? You should! You'd be surprised just<br/>how varied they can be these days.")
('Guide Hendrick', 'At night, we mainly show movies that cater to more<br/>dedicated cinephiles, as well as re-runs of<br/>famous films.')
('Guide Hendrick', 'Some are rather mature and require an age restriction.<br/>Those are often shown during our<br/>nighttime screenings.')
('Guide Hendrick', "Welcome to Esprit Cinema! It's my great pleasure<br/>to serve as your guide.")
('Guide Hendrick', "I've been working here for twenty years, so I can go<br/>into considerable detail about almost<br/>anything film-related.")
('Agnès', "You've been working here for that long? So you<br/>must've started around when orbal films first<br/>started showing.")
('Guide Hendrick', "That's right. As a matter of fact, I've been here since<br/>the theater itself was first constructed.")
('Guide Hendrick', 'In those days, films were largely similar to traditional<br/>theater, but they now possess a culture of their own.')
('Guide Hendrick', 'The landscape has changed, too. The big three<br/>distributors used to just be United Star, Orion Films,<br/>and Kowloon Pictures.')
('Guide Hendrick', "But along the way, Vegas Films entered the ring, and<br/>since then, we've had a wider variety of films to watch<br/>than ever before.")
('Feri', 'Huh. Well, thanks for the crash course in film<br/>history, mister. Now I really wanna learn more<br/>about movies!')
('Guide Hendrick', "Haha. I admire your spirit. I suppose they must still<br/>feel novel to someone who's not from the Republic.")
('Guide Hendrick', "Well, I hope you enjoy the movies. I think you'll find<br/>them more than worth your while.")
('Guide Hendrick', 'The popularity of films has led the industry to hold<br/>annual festivals dedicated to them.')
('Guide Hendrick', "Sadly, this year's film festival in Messeldam has been<br/>canceled due to extenuating circumstances.")
('Guide Hendrick', "However, there's another one in the works, which I'm<br/>certainly looking forward to seeing.")
('Tokey', "I've been assisting with sorting and<br/>distributing supplies.")
('Tokey', "This movie theater has been good to me for so long,<br/>so it's high time I repaid the favor by making<br/>myself useful!")
('Tokey', "We don't know how long we're going to be stuck<br/>here, so it's up to each of us to do whatever we can<br/>to contribute.")
('Tokey', "How could such a catastrophe befall us right at the<br/>end of the year?! It's unimaginable!")
('Tokey', "Still, I commend the movie theater for taking<br/>people in. For as long as I've been coming here, I've<br/>always known it as a big, sturdy building.")
('Tokey', 'And from what I hear, they recently reinforced it in<br/>preparation for disaster situations such as this.')
('Tokey', 'Now that those sinister spheres are no more, we<br/>should be able to hold down the fort!')
('Tokey', "When the Revolution Festival comes around, this<br/>theater likes to rerun that year's most popular films.")
('Tokey', "But I don't understand why they show all this<br/>contemporary crap when they could be playing<br/>the classics.")
('Tokey', "With so many tourists in town, it's a waste not to<br/>educate them on the history of our country's fine<br/>film industry.")
('Tokey', 'Before I watched that Gloria film, I had my<br/>reservations about Nina Fenly being cast as the lead.')
('Tokey', 'But midway through the movie, my misgivings<br/>faded somewhat. I can see how she won the award for<br/>best actress.')
('Tokey', "For a newbie, she's definitely got some serious acting<br/>chops, I'll give her that much.")
('Tokey', "Beyond that, the crew clearly did their research. I was<br/>impressed at their attention to detail—even down to<br/>the characters' accessories.")
('Tokey', "This has been a rather...eventful year, to be certain,<br/>especially with last week's tragedy.")
('Tokey', 'Yet somehow, the festival will carry on, it seems...')
('Tokey', "Now, then. What should I watch today? This year has<br/>seen its fair share of worthwhile films, so picking one<br/>won't be easy.")
('Tokey', 'That Gloria film is all the rage again now that the<br/>Revolution Festival is almost here.')
('Tokey', "Frankly, I still can't help but feel that it's wrong to<br/>have an Easterner playing Sheena Dirke.")
('Tokey', "Although, people my age have had good things to say<br/>about her performance. Maybe I'll go see the movie<br/>so I can pick it apart.")
('Tokey', "In all my many years of living, I've never seen<br/>anything so horrifying befall our Republic...")
('Tokey', 'It reminds me of when that cult went on their<br/>rampage a decade ago.')
('Tokey', "I must say, I'm impressed just how much the young<br/>people are obeying the state of emergency and<br/>maintaining order.")
('Tokey', 'I always thought that generation was completely<br/>insensitive about such things. I suppose I have to start<br/>changing my tune.')
('Tokey', "I'm glad that Climber's Story movie was narrated by<br/>an actual mountaineer. It gave an authentic touch to<br/>that film.")
('Tokey', "I've heard that some movies filmed out in the real<br/>world have staged scenes in them.")
('Tokey', "I didn't get that sense from this movie, but it's a good<br/>reason why audiences need to watch with a more<br/>discerning eye.")
('Tokey', "Hmph. Youngins won't stop yammering on about<br/>that scandal Judith Lanster found herself in.")
('Tokey', "An actor's job is to act out stories, not be a paradigm<br/>of morality!")
('Tokey', "But young people these days want them to be as pure<br/>as the driven snow. I can't understand it.")
('Tokey', "As if that weren't bad enough, I hear there are<br/>entertainers called 'idols' that sell themselves on that<br/>exact hogwash. How embarrassing!")
('Tokey', "I heard they've cast an Easterner named Nina Fenly<br/>as Sheena Dirke in that upcoming Gloria movie.")
('Tokey', 'Did the director sleep through history class<br/>or something? Sheena Dirke was WHITE!')
('Tokey', "You can't favor diversity over historical accuracy.<br/>It's just plain wrong!")
('Tokey', 'Plus, if they wanted to cast an Easterner, General<br/>Atkinson was right there. He was mixed race!')
('Tokey', "Oh, for Aidios' sake. Why must they show that<br/>Salvatore Gotti travesty again after all this time?")
('Tokey', 'They already suspended it once. Did they suddenly<br/>decide it had value because it was the runner-up for<br/>best direction?')
('Tokey', 'Ridiculous. Utterly and completely ridiculous.<br/>How could this theater have fallen so low? *sigh*...')
('Tokey', "I'm not surprised Wolves' Requiem won the best<br/>direction award. It wasn't my choice, but better that<br/>than Golden Blood.")
('Tokey', "There's no obscene content in that movie, unlike<br/>Gotti's trash. You can tell it has respect for the<br/>motion pictures that came before it.")
('Tokey', "It's no match for the greatest films the medium has<br/>produced, but as a piece of mass market<br/>entertainment, it's good enough.")
('Tokey', 'This Side of Heaven does a fair job depicting the<br/>challenges that physicians face.')
('Tokey', "Unfortunately, I don't love its contextual usage<br/>of music. It reeks of trend chasing.")
('Tokey', "Back when movies were new, intimate scenes<br/>between characters would have no music. They'd only<br/>have a few ambient sounds at most.")
('Tokey', 'But movies these days will blast mediocre music in<br/>those moments. Those damned record companies are<br/>ruining cinema!')
('Tokey', "I heard the Tharbad Film Festival is being planned by<br/>Vegas Films. Nothing good will come out of that,<br/>I'm sure...")
('Tokey', "Messeldam's film festivals are the culmination of<br/>businesses and cultural organizations coming together<br/>to make something great.")
('Tokey', "Their focus isn't on making mira—they want to<br/>promote the cultural value of films.")
('Tokey', 'But Vegas Films is a greedy company that makes its<br/>money off tacky thrills. With Gotti overseeing the<br/>event, my expectations for it are rock bottom.')
('Tokey', "Ahh... Sober Curious. Now there's a film with some<br/>meat on its bones.")
('Tokey', "It's more or less a thriller, but they did an excellent<br/>job depicting the duality of human beings.")
('Tokey', "It certainly wasn't perfect, but I'll gladly take it over<br/>the cheap fluff that's being churned out.")
('Tokey', "Hmph. I've been coming to this theater for a long<br/>time because I could always trust them to show<br/>quality films.")
('Tokey', "But as of late, the only movies they show are sleazy<br/>films that rely solely on cheap, visceral shocks.<br/>It's disgraceful, I say!")
('Tokey', 'The most deplorable director of all is that<br/>Salvatore Gotti. His rise to fame boggles the mind!')
('Cathy', "The movie theater people have been telling me what's<br/>happening in the city.")
('Cathy', "I'm still worried about Mama, but they've helped<br/>calm me down a little.")
('Cathy', "That said, I can't let myself be scared forever!<br/>Not when the grown-ups are doing everything they<br/>can to help!")
('Cathy', 'Now that I feel better, I need to find something I can<br/>do to help out!')
('Cathy', 'Why? How could this happen?!')
('Cathy', "I went to check on Mama 'cause she was in the<br/>restroom a long time...")
('Cathy', '...and she was standing completely still. It was like she<br/>was frozen in time!')
('Cathy', "Mama's gonna turn back to normal...right?")
('Cathy', "There are so many people who are frozen, too.<br/>It's not just Mama...")
('Cathy', "They're all gonna be okay, right? I want Mama back...")
('Cathy', "Yay! Today's the special film festival movie<br/>screening day! I'm gonna watch a bunch of movies!")
('Cathy', "Mama said she'd watch them all with me till it<br/>gets dark. I'm so excited!")
('Cathy', "I just gotta wait for her to finish using the restroom.<br/>I wish she'd hurry up!")
('Cathy', "I missed out on Gloria when it came out, but now<br/>I've finally seen it.")
('Cathy', "Nina Fenly was an awesome Sheena Dirke. She's<br/>the best!")
('Cathy', "I learned a whole bunch from that movie. There were<br/>things about the revolution that they didn't teach us<br/>in Sunday School.")
('Cathy', "It's my favorite movie I've seen all year! I loved it!")
('Cathy', "A whole village disappeared? A-Are you sure that's<br/>not the story of some movie?")
('Cathy', 'It really happened? Then does that mean...everyone<br/>who lived there...')
('Cathy', "I-I don't wanna think about it. I'm scared now.<br/>Hurry up and get outta the restroom, Mama...")
('Cathy', 'A lot of grown-ups are recommending Mishy in<br/>Boots to kids.')
('Cathy', "But they wouldn't be saying that if they saw it<br/>for themselves. *shiver*")
('Cathy', "Did something happen to Judith Lanster?<br/>Why's everyone talking about her?")
('Cathy', "Someone said she's making love, but I don't know<br/>what that means. I heard she does that in Golden<br/>Blood Director's Cut, so maybe that's what it is?")
('Cathy', "I-I'm not scared of watching Midnight Memories!<br/>R-Really!")
('Cathy', "I'm just waiting for Mama to come back from<br/>the restroom. Going into a theater without<br/>permission is wrong, you know!")
('Cathy', "If... If she doesn't get back until after it's started,<br/>that's okay! It's more fun if we watch it together!")
('Cathy', "I cried a bunch when Mama told me we had to give<br/>up on going to the Tharbad Film Festival.<br/>There wasn't any place to stay.")
('Cathy', "She says I'm too young to go all by myself. I'm pretty<br/>mature for my age, though, so I won't make a big fuss<br/>about it.")
('Cathy', "But I sure would've loved to see it. Any festival<br/>planned by Salvatore Gotti's bound to have all kinds<br/>of fun surprises. *sigh*...")
('Cathy', 'I just saw The Peony Blade. Everybody complains<br/>about the low budget, but I thought the sword fights<br/>were amazing!')
('Cathy', 'I guess the Eastern-looking street shots were filmed<br/>in Calvard. I liked seeing all the weird stuff in<br/>the background.')
('Cathy', "Mama's being a real slowpoke today.")
('Cathy', "I love movies that get me all hyped up. That's why I<br/>always look forward to seeing Salvatore Gotti's films.")
('Cathy', "It's also why I like horror movies. They're pretty<br/>cathartic—as the grown-ups say.")
('Cathy', "The staff only recommend kiddy movies to me. I get<br/>why they do, but they're so boring!")
('Cathy', "Ugh... What's taking Mama so long? Does it really<br/>take thirty minutes to use the restroom?")
('Cathy', "All this waiting's making ME want to go now, too!")
('Owner Mau', "Now that we know what we're dealing with, it's time<br/>for me to spring into action.")
('Owner Mau', 'If we combine forces with the Lu family, we should<br/>be able to even the odds.')
('Owner Mau', "I wish you the best of luck with your plan. If there's<br/>anything you need, don't be afraid to reach out to us.")
('Owner Mau', 'I can always count on you to pull through,<br/>Mr. Arkride. Thanks to you, we can now operate<br/>more freely.')
('Owner Mau', "It shouldn't be long now before we're able to make<br/>contact with Cao and Fan.")
('Owner Mau', "Once we've reconnected with them, we can put<br/>Almata in their place. In the meantime, let's just keep<br/>fighting the good fight.")
('Van', "I don't know if your idea of 'the good fight' lines up<br/>with ours, but I'll wish you best of luck anyway.")
('Aaron', "Watch yourselves. Those bastards have something up<br/>their sleeves. Don't let it trip you up.")
('Owner Mau', "That's my line, pretty boy. Now get out there and<br/>earn your keep—and that goes for you, too, ladies.")
('Agnès', "Yes, ma'am! Thanks for looking after my friends, too!")
('Owner Mau', "One of my duties is to help maintain the peace<br/>around here. You can be sure I'll get the residents<br/>around here to safety.")
('Owner Mau', "I plan to move out once we've reconnected with Cao<br/>and Fan.")
('Owner Mau', "But don't wait for me. Go out there and earn<br/>your keep.")
('Owner Mau', "Good to see you're all in one piece. I take it you've<br/>got a good grasp on the situation now?")
('Owner Mau', "Don't worry about us. We're just going to be<br/>sheltering the people of the neighborhood here.<br/>You go on out there and do what you have to do.")
('Aaron', "Wish we could stick around and help out, but yeah,<br/>we've got shit to take care of.")
('Van', "We'll leave this area to you.")
('Owner Mau', "Thanks. You'll be doing us a favor by resolving this.")
('Owner Mau', 'Several of our people are frozen in time, so the sooner<br/>you fix this mess, the better.')
('Owner Mau', 'The restaurant is secure. Feel free to use it as a base<br/>of operations.')
('Owner Mau', "Meanwhile, I'll be getting ready to link up with the<br/>Lu family. You can be sure that Heiyue isn't going to<br/>be sitting idly by during all of this.")
('Owner Mau', "Things are as bustling today as I thought it'd be.<br/>I think I might take this rare opportunity to serve<br/>some of our guests myself.")
('Owner Mau', "Tonight, we're expecting executives who are in town<br/>for the Revolution Festival. They're converging here<br/>for a meeting.")
('Owner Mau', "It should be a good time—and not just for them.<br/>It'll give us insight into their trajectory for the coming<br/>year as well.")
('Owner Mau', 'Cao told me you guys wiped the floor with Almata.<br/>I appreciate it.')
('Owner Mau', 'With them out of the way, we can fully turn our<br/>attention towards preparing for the<br/>Revolution Festival.')
('Owner Mau', "A number of members of the Lu family will be in<br/>town, so we'll have to come prepared with a reception<br/>that rises to the occasion.")
('Owner Mau', 'The elders were in disarray last week, but I think<br/>things will finally be winding down soon.')
('Owner Mau', "And that means it'll be my turn to receive them when<br/>they come to town. I can't disappoint them.")
('Owner Mau', "We may have dealt a decisive blow to Almata, but<br/>they haven't been fully eradicated.")
('Owner Mau', 'However, it should only be a matter of time before<br/>the remnants are rounded up.')
('Owner Mau', "Once that happens, the balance of power in the<br/>underworld is sure to shift. I can't wait to see who<br/>ends up on top.")
('Owner Mau', "Those people have gone too far. We're left with no<br/>choice but to crush them.")
('Owner Mau', "How we'll accomplish that end is still up in the<br/>air, however.")
('Owner Mau', "We'll have to follow the elders' orders to the letter,<br/>regardless of what those orders may be.")
('Owner Mau', 'With a situation as grave as this, there are only so<br/>many ways we can respond.')
('Owner Mau', "Depending on how things go, it's possible that there<br/>could be blood on the streets of Edith.")
('Owner Mau', "I'll admit. I do have my concerns about what the<br/>other families are up to right now.")
('Owner Mau', 'But, in the end, we have to follow whatever orders the<br/>elders give us.')
('Owner Mau', "Great news. We've decided to open two new<br/>Caiyunge branches.")
('Owner Mau', 'We bought two properties: a building in Messeldam<br/>that emptied out after terror threats and an<br/>Anchorville storefront that got damaged last month.')
('Owner Mau', "You can be sure we'll be making them special places<br/>to visit.")
('Van', 'Yeah, yeah. Get that smug look off your face.<br/>These ventures of yours sound about as virtuous<br/>as Aaron.')
('Aaron', "Hey, leave me out of this. So what's the goal?<br/>Trying to keep an eye on Almata?")
('Agnès', 'So why open stores in those places? Are you trying to<br/>keep an eye on Almata?')
('Owner Mau', "Hmm? I have no idea what you're talking about.<br/>I'm only trying to spread the joy of authentic Eastern<br/>cuisine to more places.")
('Owner Mau', "Mind you, the plan isn't set in stone. We got the<br/>properties for cheap, but depending on their<br/>condition, we might reconsider.")
('Owner Mau', "After all, our organization is nothing if not flexible.<br/>We're good at thinking on our feet.")
('Owner Mau', "We're very much interested in expanding into<br/>other regions.")
('Owner Mau', "Depending on the condition of the properties,<br/>though, we may pull out. We'll just have to see.")
('Owner Mau', "Hah. Kunming's got guts, bossing Kaohan around<br/>like that.")
('Owner Mau', "She's completely clueless about our true line of<br/>business—and personally, I'd like to keep it that way.")
('Owner Mau', "Things are heating up behind the scenes, so if I want<br/>her to stay out of harm's way, I'll have to redouble<br/>my efforts.")
('Owner Mau', "I'd better link up with Cao so we can start<br/>investigating the situation.")
('Owner Mau', "I wouldn't want to be that SID detective. He has his<br/>work cut out for him.")
('Owner Mau', "I'm rooting for him, though. If the police are able to<br/>contain the mafia, that'd be quite the boon for us.")
('Owner Mau', "Perhaps I'll see what I can do to help, insofar as<br/>circumstances allow me.")
('Owner Mau', "Oh, you must be the famous Crimson Khan I've<br/>heard so much about. It's a pleasure to meet you<br/>at last.")
('Owner Mau', "My deepest condolences about what happened to<br/>your friends. I wasn't able to attend the service, but I<br/>did send a funeral offering.")
('Aaron', 'Thanks. Nice to meet you, too. I knew Heiyue had<br/>some kinda operation up here.')
('Aaron', "You must be the one who calls the shots around here.<br/>Who're you with? I'm guessing it's not the Lu family,<br/>is it?")
('Owner Mau', "Ahaha! Already cutting to the chase, are we? Cao was<br/>right—you're an absolute riot.")
('Owner Mau', "Come back whenever you like and I'll treat you to<br/>some Langport dishes done right. Don't be a<br/>stranger, you hear?")
('Aaron', "Nice. I'll keep that in mind.<br/>(Is she one of the higher ups? Definitely looks like a<br/>tough chick.)")
('Van', "(Don't get any funny ideas. I'm sure you two would<br/>hit it off, but trust me, you don't wanna get in the<br/>habit of comin' here.)")
('Owner Mau', 'I caught wind of what happened over in Langport.')
('Owner Mau', 'It seems you all handled the situation quite well.')
('Owner Mau', 'At any rate, what happened in Langport indicates we<br/>need to be on guard here in the capital. If chaos can<br/>strike there, it can strike here.')
('Owner Mau', 'Although, I do like being able to turn those situations<br/>to my advantage.')
('Owner Mau', 'The restaurant business is a natural path to building a<br/>foothold into a region.')
('Owner Mau', 'Our family has cemented its position in the capital<br/>over generations now, so we have a good grasp of all<br/>that goes on behind the scenes.')
('Owner Mau', 'Things have gotten dicier around here in the past<br/>couple of weeks. Be careful not to get caught up in<br/>any trouble.')
('Owner Mau', "Welcome back, Mr. Arkride. What brings you here<br/>of all places? Haven't you had your dinner by now?")
('Van', "Don't ask questions you already know the answers<br/>to, lady.")
('Owner Mau', 'Aww. Did Cao get you in a snippy mood? Poor thing.')
('Owner Mau', 'When he asked me to order that dried fruit, I was<br/>wondering what he needed it for. And now I have<br/>my answer.')
('Owner Mau', "I'm not one to take sides on these things. Cao and I<br/>come from different families, but I know this much<br/>about him: he can be a very persuasive man.")
('Van', "(From what I've heard, it's customary for the eight<br/>elders who run Heiyue to come from each of the<br/>different families.)")
('Van', "(If I had to guess, Mau's probably at the same level in<br/>the organization as Cao, but she doesn't serve the<br/>same role as him.)")
('Van', "(Ugh. It's not like I care to know the inner workings<br/>of these people, but I'd be eaten alive in my dealings<br/>with them if I didn't.)")
('Owner Mau', "I'm not one to take sides. After all, Cao and I come<br/>from different families, but I do know he can be a<br/>very persuasive man.")
('Owner Mau', "I hear Langport is quite the rowdy city these days.<br/>You sure you don't need a little insurance going into a<br/>place like that?")
('Van', "I'm fine. Ugh, this is already a pain in the ass, and we<br/>haven't even started.")
('Owner Mau', "I'm sure he only gave you such a challenging job<br/>because he knew you could handle it.")
('Owner Mau', 'Oh, you may also be interested to know that we have<br/>a pair of intriguing guests on the second floor.')
('Owner Mau', 'Hopefully they enjoy their time with us. We always<br/>aim to please.')
('Owner Mau', "Welcome to Caiyunge, Edith's number one home<br/>for Eastern cuisine.")
('Owner Mau', "You won't find a single restaurant in this city with<br/>more authentic food. I guarantee it.")
('Agnès', "I've never been inside here before. It looks very nice<br/>and clean.")
('Feri', "Yeah, and the food smells great! It's making<br/>me hungry!")
('Owner Mau', "That's very kind of you to say. Thank you.")
('Owner Mau', "Ah. Well, if it isn't the chief of Arkride<br/>Solutions himself. How kind of you to grace us with<br/>your presence.")
('Owner Mau', 'Oh, please do make yourself at home, good sir. It is<br/>my honor and pleasure to serve such a<br/>distinguished guest.')
('Van', 'Yeah, yeah. Whatever.')
('Agnès', '(Hmm? That was an...odd exchange. Are<br/>they acquainted?)')
('Owner Mau', "You ladies both look like bright young women.<br/>We'll serve you the finest Eastern cuisine you'll ever<br/>taste, so we hope you enjoy your time here.")
('Owner Mau', 'Oh, and same to you, Mr. Arkride. Enjoy your meal.')
('Van', '(Hrrng. This lady ticks me off.)')
('Agnès', "(Okay, yes. They're definitely acquainted.)")
('Kaohan', 'Fan, Cao, Lady Ashen, and Ms. Mau are discussing<br/>the operation that will hopefully put an end to<br/>this crisis.')
('Kaohan', "I would've taken great pleasure in treating Fan to all<br/>my finest dishes. Alas, it wasn't meant to be.")
('Kaohan', 'Regardless, I still have a role I must play.')
('Kaohan', 'Whatever fate has in store for me, I shall carry my<br/>duties out to the very end.')
('Kaohan', 'You all did well in exterminating those spheres.<br/>We shall handle the rest from here.')
('Kaohan', 'Other groups are doing their utmost to resolve the<br/>crisis at hand. So, too, shall we rise to the occasion—<br/>and proudly so.')
('Kaohan', 'This is a defining moment for Kowloon—no, for all<br/>of Heiyue. Our legacy will be defined by what we do<br/>in these crucial moments.')
('Kaohan', 'One of the reasons we set up shop in this city was so<br/>we could respond to situations such as this.')
('Kaohan', "Nobody could've seen anything like this coming, but<br/>we're already assembling whatever members we<br/>can dispatch.")
('Kaohan', "Don't worry about the evacuees. You can leave them<br/>and the security of this area to us.")
('Kaohan', "There's no need to concern yourselves about us.<br/>I have some knowledge of martial arts, so I can look<br/>after everyone.")
('Kaohan', "I'm fully prepared to lay down my life to protect this<br/>establishment and the people here.")
('Kaohan', 'I wish I could leave the restaurant and survey other<br/>parts of the city.')
('Kaohan', 'If only we could get rid of those annoying spheres...')
('Kaohan', "Thank you for choosing to dine with us. We hope<br/>you're enjoying the Revolution Festival.")
('Kaohan', 'Ugh. Must she always make such a racket...<br/>*cough* Sorry. May I take your order?')
('Kaohan', '(This madness again? Give me a break.)')
('Kaohan', "(Well, I was 'out sick' for a while. I suppose I can do<br/>whatever she wants for the time being.)")
('Kaohan', '...Ah, welcome. May I take your order?')
('Kaohan', '...Is there something on the menu that catches<br/>your eye?')
('Kaohan', 'Hmm...')
('Kaohan', "Oh, don't mind me. I was simply mulling<br/>something over.")
('Kaohan', "(There's something fishy about that whole scandal...)")
('Kaohan', '(Perhaps I should report it to the elders.)')
('Kaohan', "...Please, take your time while you're here. Relax<br/>and enjoy.")
('Kaohan', "(What's with all these odd jobs? Did that part-timer<br/>girl put me up to this...?)")
('Kaohan', "(*sigh* What a hassle. I guess there's only so much<br/>she can handle, but still...)")
('Kaohan', "...I'll take your order whenever you're ready.")
('Kaohan', '...Is there something on the menu that catches<br/>your eye?')
('Aaron', '...')
('Kaohan', 'Do I...have something on my face?')
('Aaron', "Nah, I was just sizing you up. I can tell you're packing<br/>some real chi under that chef's hat.")
('Kaohan', 'But of course.')
('Kaohan', "Not to boast, but Ms. Mau has incredibly<br/>high standards. I couldn't serve as a cook in this<br/>establishment unless I had what it took.")
('Aaron', "Uhh... I wasn't talking about your cooking skills.")
('Van', "(The way he's talkin', I bet he's either Mau's<br/>bodyguard or her contact with the main part of<br/>the organization.)")
('Van', "(So long as we just come here to eat, he shouldn't<br/>pose a threat.)")
('Kaohan', "Welcome. I see you don't have your office's latest hire<br/>with you. That's unfortunate.")
('Kaohan', "I managed to work out the Crimson Khan's food<br/>preferences today on top of my normal duties.<br/>I function as our liaison with Langport.")
('Van', '(Damn. Nothing gets past this guy, does it?)')
('Van', "(I've got a feeling he's more than just a go-between<br/>guy with Heiyue's different branches.)")
('Kaohan', 'At any rate, may I take your order?')
('Kaohan', "I would personally recommend the hotpot.<br/>It's something of a specialty of mine.")
('Kaohan', "...I'll take your order whenever you're ready.")
('Kaohan', '...Greetings.')
('Kaohan', "...Please, take your time while you're here. Relax<br/>and enjoy.")
('Kaohan', "...Please, take your time while you're here. Relax<br/>and enjoy.")
('Kunming', 'Kaohan, Kaohan! I brought you some food!')
('Kunming', 'The head chef made it himself, so it should be nice<br/>and tasty!')
('Kaohan', '...Oh.')
('Kunming', "Huh? Whaddaya mean, 'Oh'? Were you raised in<br/>a barn?! When someone brings food to you, you're<br/>SUPPOSED to say, 'Thank you.'")
('Kaohan', '...Oh.')
('Kunming', "Grr... Now you're doing it on purpose!")
('Kunming', "Oh, well. Since I'm SOOO nice and mature, I'll let it<br/>slide—but only this once! You better watch<br/>yourself, buster!")
('Kunming', 'Hey, Kaohan. You know that customer who booked<br/>the entire restaurant earlier?')
('Kaohan', '...Yes. What about it?')
('Kunming', 'It kinda bothers me that I never got to do any serving<br/>that entire time.')
('Kunming', 'Did I do something wrong? Was I rude somehow?')
('Kaohan', '...No. You were fine.')
('Kunming', "(Well, it sure seems like something was going on.<br/>It's bothering the heck out of me!)")
('Van', "(The fact that he was servin' upper management<br/>could only mean one thing.)")
('Van', '(He must be one of them. That would explain why he<br/>always looks on guard.)')
('Kunming', 'I wonder what Ms. Mau and those Kowloon Group<br/>bigwigs are discussing.')
('Kunming', "Whatever it is, she looked calm when I snuck a peek<br/>at them, so maybe it's nothing too serious.")
('Kunming', "But I just don't understand why she won't let me<br/>serve those guys whenever they book the restaurant<br/>to themselves.")
('Kunming', '...Wait. I just had a crazy thought. Could this place<br/>be...a front for Heiyue?')
('Van', "(She's only NOW realizing that?!)")
('Aaron', '(And the award for the most oblivious girl in the<br/>world goes to...)')
('Kunming', "Well, even if Ms. Mau and Kaohan work for<br/>Heiyue, that's okay! I still respect them a ton!")
('Kunming', "If anything, I respect them even more now.<br/>They gave me this job and kept me out of harm's way<br/>this whole time.")
('Kunming', "I've gotta do everything I can to help! This restaurant<br/>needs me, too, and I wanna get through this<br/>with everyone!")
('Kunming', 'Thank you guys so much! It sounds like things are<br/>calming down outside.')
('Kunming', 'I think Kaohan and Ms. Mau might have something<br/>up their sleeves, too.')
('Kunming', "I don't really know what's going on right now, but I'll<br/>put my trust in them.")
('Kunming', "I'm glad that I got the chance to meet everyone here.<br/>I'll continue to help them out—even if I know they<br/>can handle themselves.")
('Kunming', "I... I can't believe the festival's all...ruined. Just<br/>like that!")
('Kunming', "Ms. Mau and Kaohan are so amazing, though.<br/>It's like this whole thing hasn't fazed them one bit!")
('Kunming', "...Now that I think about it, why ARE they so calm?<br/>Shouldn't they be, like, a little panicky, at least?")
('Kunming', 'Oh, well. I guess that just goes to show how<br/>dependable they are!')
('Kunming', "I better pitch in, too. I've gotta carry my weight<br/>around here!")
('Kunming', "I'll go get some medicine for the evacuees. I can apply<br/>some basic first aid to the injured.")
('Kunming', 'Ms. Mau and Kaohan have things under control,<br/>but I can at least help lighten the load!')
('Kunming', "Aaaaaah! Where did all these customers come from?!<br/>I'm dying here!")
('Kunming', "Well, it's sink or swim, and I'm sure as heck not<br/>gonna sink! Wish me luck!")
('Kunming', 'Kaohan is, like, the most awkward and unfriendly<br/>person ever.')
('Kunming', "I wish he'd lean on me a little more. He was out sick<br/>until recently, so I don't mind lending a hand.")
('Kunming', 'I decided to play a little prank on Kaohan.')
('Kunming', 'He took a whole week off work. When he came back,<br/>I piled a bunch of my neglected chores onto him.<br/>Heehee!')
('Kunming', "He seems to be doing better, but I'm taking over<br/>table-waiting duty. That way, he doesn't have to walk<br/>around a bunch. Aren't I nice?")
('Kunming', "You know, I haven't seen Kaohan around<br/>here lately.")
('Kunming', "And Ms. Mau's been really busy with something, too.<br/>What the heck is going on?")
('Kunming', 'Maybe it has something to do with what happened<br/>in Creil...')
('Kunming', "Those two haven't been their usual selves. It's making<br/>me a little anxious...")
('Kunming', "But there's still work to be done here, and it's not<br/>gonna get done if I keep moping around! I better get<br/>to it!")
('Kunming', "Heehee. Ms. Mau complimented me today! She said<br/>I'm doing a good job studying everything I need to<br/>know for this job!")
('Kunming', "You can't work here unless you know your stuff, so I<br/>really hit the books when I was hired!")
('Kunming', 'How am I supposed to be a good server unless I know<br/>the history behind our dishes and what makes each of<br/>them so special?')
('Kunming', 'You never know when that knowledge might come in<br/>handy on the job!')
('Kunming', "There's tons of different types of Eastern cuisine in<br/>the Republic—including some that<br/>originated elsewhere.")
('Kunming', "The stuff we make is similar to what's served in<br/>Langport, but it came from the Far East originally.<br/>People there brought it here by sea routes.")
('Kunming', "And there's other cultural stuff that came in by land,<br/>including the idea of wabi-sabi—or beauty<br/>in imperfection.")
('Kunming', "It's all so fascinating to me, and it makes me wanna<br/>sit down and try all kinds of Eastern foods.")
('Kunming', "Huh? Wh-What the...? He's already done going<br/>through all the flyers and sales slips?!")
('Kunming', "Not only that, but he also took care of next month's<br/>ingredient list and tweaked the menus! Oh, and<br/>there's a note, too...")
('Kunming', "'Get these back to Ms. Mau. Also, apologize to her<br/>for getting carried away, while you're at it.'")
('Kunming', 'Eeek! He sounds SO mad! And how is he so freaking<br/>capable, anyway?!')
('Kunming', 'Oh, umm, sorry for all the yelling. I should get back<br/>to work.')
('Kunming', "I just don't understand how Kaohan is that talented.<br/>I'm half-convinced he isn't even human.")
('Kunming', "Kaohan's so stiff and serious, and he tries SO hard<br/>to ignore me. But that's about to change...")
('Kunming', "I just took all of last month's unfiled leaflets and sales<br/>slips and dropped them in his lap!")
('Kunming', "Heehee. I bet he's freaking out right this second.<br/>Once I offer to help him out of his jam, he'll HAVE<br/>to notice me! ㈱")
('Kunming', "Hey there! What'll it be today?")
('Kunming', "You know what's weird? Ms. Mau and Kaohan like<br/>to go off and have some private chats sometimes.")
('Kunming', "I don't know about you, but I'm DYING to know<br/>what they talk about!")
('Kunming', "I wish they'd let me listen in, too! It's no fair!")
('Kunming', "I don't mean to bug anyone or anything. I just feel<br/>like they're pushing me off to the side. It stinks!")
('Kunming', "*cough* Anyway, I'll take your order here whenever<br/>you're ready. Please, stay for a while and eat with us!")
('Kunming', 'Kaohan! Hey, Kaohan! Are you listening?!')
('Kunming', "Welcome! If you've been searching for the most legit<br/>Eastern food Edith's got, then look no more!")
('Kunming', "We don't cut any corners here. All of our ingredients<br/>are sourced straight from the Eastern Quarter. And so<br/>are all of our staff, too.")
('Kunming', "I'm not so special, though. I only work here<br/>part time.")
('Kunming', "Do you know Kaohan? We're the same age.<br/>He works in the kitchen, but he's at the very bottom<br/>of the totem pole.")
('Kunming', "He's also kinda...antisocial. I don't think he's really<br/>cut out to be waiting tables. If you ask me, he's way in<br/>over his head.")
('Kunming', "But it's okay, because he's got a capable person<br/>looking after him. Me!")
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', 'Thanks for securing things around here. We really<br/>owe you one.')
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', "I'm concerned about the reporters we still can't reach,<br/>but for now, we'll just have to make do with what<br/>we have.")
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', "As we work on ascertaining the situation, we'll be<br/>gathering information and processing it however we<br/>need to.")
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', "We'll contact you if we stumble across something big.<br/>Until then...stay safe out there.")
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', 'Chief Cunning knew how to put Dingo and his<br/>talent as a reporter to good use.')
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', "He's definitely got an eye for people, and he also has<br/>principles that he abides by.")
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', 'I could stand to learn a thing or two from him.')
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', "The Republic has never faced a crisis like this before<br/>in its long history. There's a lot of unrest among the<br/>citizens right now.")
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', 'And that goes for us, too. We know all the questions<br/>that people want answered about this situation!')
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', 'We at the Tyrell Times have one job and one job<br/>only: to bring facts to the people before<br/>disinformation muddies the waters.')
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', "What you're doing is vital to the well-being of<br/>this country. Be proud of what you do as you go out<br/>and get those answers!")
(15292, 'Yes, Chief!')
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', "This is a completely unprecedented situation.<br/>It's really putting our abilities to the test.")
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', "There's more to this story than what the government<br/>has led us to believe.")
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', "The people are counting on us to shed light on the<br/>truth, so that's exactly what we'll do.")
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', 'When I heard Marielle had been kidnapped, I was<br/>worried it would traumatize her and dampen<br/>her spirits.')
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', 'But she got right back on her feet and wrote up a<br/>top-notch article. I had nothing to be worried about<br/>after all.')
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', "Her drive never ceases to amaze. I can't wait to see<br/>where her bright future takes her.")
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', 'Thanks again for your report. I genuinely appreciate<br/>your work.')
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', 'I was puzzled over how Roderick survived that ordeal,<br/>but now I have the answer.')
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', "It's great that he was able to be reunited with that<br/>locket after all those years.")
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', "Knowing that he's in a better place now makes me<br/>glad that I was able to step in and help, at least to the<br/>extent I was able to.")
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', "You'll find Roderick sitting at the terrace over by<br/>the station.")
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', 'Once you meet him and get everything wrapped up, I<br/>expect you to report back to me and fill me in on<br/>what happened.')
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', "I won't deny that his methods get results.")
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', 'But in this day and age, there are a lot of questions<br/>about what our job is as journalists and how we<br/>should go about it.')
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', "It's why I'm happy to have principled up-and-comers<br/>like Marielle on staff. That said, her zealous energy<br/>is a bit...concerning, admittedly.")
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', 'It was nice to see Marielle make a name for herself<br/>before the festival.')
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', "Dingo was always worried about that girl, but she's<br/>doing just fine now. Maybe he can finally rest easy...")
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', '...especially now that his legacy is in her hands, just<br/>like he wanted.')
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', "I'd like to think so. Marielle idolized him, and she<br/>was so determined to reach his level.")
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', "When he died, I was worried she was going to lose<br/>her way, but she's pushing forward harder than ever.")
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', 'I think she owes a lot of that to your leadership.')
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', "In the end, Dingo was avenged, and that's<br/>what matters. Now it's on us to keep going—and that<br/>starts with the Revolution Festival.")
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', "I'm sure our publication will be examining it through<br/>a different lens, but I look forward to seeing what you<br/>bring to the table.")
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', "Likewise. You can be sure we'll be putting up a good<br/>fight on the newsstands like always, Chief Cunning.")
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', 'You did a good job, Marielle. Your writeup on<br/>Tharbad has made a pretty big splash.')
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', 'Looks like I made the right call to send you out there.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'You really think so? Aww. Thanks, chief!')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "I-I guess that means I'm that much closer to being on<br/>his level!")
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', "I...have my concerns about how fixated you are on<br/>that man, but I'll put those worries off to the side for<br/>the time being.")
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', "It's safe to say that what you've accomplished is going<br/>to help you grow even more as a reporter.")
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', "But never forget: a journalist's true worth is found in<br/>what they do when they're confronted with<br/>the unexpected.")
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', "Just keep trying to improve so that—even when<br/>you're caught by surprise—you'll make all the<br/>right decisions.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Understood. I'll make you proud!")
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', "When it comes to the Presidential Office's activities,<br/>I'll leave the negotiations with the Patriot League<br/>senators to you.")
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', "I don't like going this route, but your connections to<br/>the administration and the press corps' information<br/>network are too valuable in this instance.")
('Reporter Langdon', "Yes, I understand. I'd be happy to look into it for you.<br/>I'll start by reaching out to members that I'm on good<br/>terms with and proceed from there.")
('Reporter Langdon', "That said, perhaps you should consider making use of<br/>the press corps' benefits more often. The Tyrell<br/>Times only has so much reach on its own.")
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', "No, I won't. I think it's important we maintain<br/>this balance.")
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', 'In this day and age, there are a lot of questions about<br/>what our job is as journalists and how we should go<br/>about it.')
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', "It's important that this organization maintains and<br/>upholds its ideals. The last thing I want to do is<br/>disrespect the legacy of my grandfather.")
('Reporter Langdon', "Very well. We'll consider this a special case so that<br/>you and your organization can hold on to your pride.")
('Reporter Langdon', "We're lucky that we can borrow that<br/>reporter's vehicle. Now we can get out there and<br/>rescue some people!")
(15295, "Holy... Did you hit your head on<br/>something, Langdon? I've never heard you say<br/>anything so selfless before!")
(15296, "Yeah, I always thought you were completely heartless!<br/>I'm sorry for ever doubting you!")
('Reporter Langdon', 'Hey! What kind of monster do you take me for?')
('Reporter Langdon', "Look, if you can't put your information network and<br/>knowledge to use at a time like this, you don't deserve<br/>to call yourself a reporter.")
('Reporter Langdon', 'Now, then. I need to get out there and find out if my<br/>contacts in the parliament are doing okay!')
('Reporter Langdon', "There are reporters out there like Chen who weren't<br/>able to get to safety in time. The least we can do is go<br/>out and round them up.")
('Reporter Langdon', 'And if we can help out some of the senators at the<br/>same time, all that better. That should net me more<br/>than a few favors for the future.')
('Reporter Langdon', "Well, this is quite the sticky situation. It'll make for a<br/>hell of a scoop, though, that's for sure.")
('Reporter Langdon', "Luckily, I was back at the office when it all went<br/>down, but I don't know how Chen and the other guys<br/>are holding up.")
('Reporter Langdon', "I'll check up on them after I make sure the parliament<br/>members are safe. I have to find a way to get in touch<br/>with them—pronto!")
('Reporter Langdon', "Ugh. My schedule's jam-packed today.")
('Reporter Langdon', 'It was bad enough that I was holed up at the press<br/>corps all morning, but now I have a meeting to attend.')
('Reporter Langdon', "Not that that's too terrible, I suppose—it's always nice<br/>when politicians are willing to talk. They've been<br/>sounding more hopeful than ever lately as well.")
('Reporter Langdon', 'That stuff up in Basel the other day sure caused me<br/>some problems.')
('Reporter Langdon', 'All of my contacts in parliament have refused to<br/>speak with me recently. The CID has likely been<br/>pressuring them to keep quiet on recent matters.')
('Reporter Langdon', "Well, it probably isn't just them.")
('Reporter Langdon', "There's a lot of red flags about all of that between<br/>Professor Cronkite being reassigned and Verne's<br/>board of directors getting shaken up.")
('Reporter Langdon', "Well, if my sources won't speak up, then there isn't<br/>much I can do except wait and see how things unfold.")
('Reporter Langdon', "When you go about this job the way I do, making<br/>compromises with the people you're dealing with is<br/>the price you have to pay.")
('Reporter Langdon', "Bah. I've been held up with the press corps, so I<br/>haven't had any time to find leads on stories from<br/>other places.")
('Reporter Langdon', "Though it's nothing I can't fix by calling in a<br/>few favors. Maybe I'll try and strike a deal with one of<br/>the smalltime news agencies.")
('Reporter Langdon', "As soon as I offer to set them up with one of my<br/>contacts in parliament, I'll have them eating from the<br/>palm of my hand.")
('Reporter Langdon', "Hmph. I won't deny that woman's article is making<br/>waves, but when you get down to it, she just<br/>happened to be at the right place at the right time.")
('Reporter Langdon', "If a cub like her lets that luck get to her head, she's<br/>going to be in for a world of hurt later.")
('Reporter Langdon', 'The keys to a long career as a reporter are<br/>both connections and a healthy amount of duplicity!<br/>Bahaha!')
('Reporter Langdon', "When you're a reporter, you've got nothing to lose by<br/>building up some solid relationships with politicians.")
('Reporter Langdon', "Of course, there's a certain line you can't ever cross,<br/>but the fact remains that they're valuable assets.")
('Reporter Langdon', 'On that note, I wonder how my contacts at the old<br/>Rocksmith administration are doing these days.')
('Reporter Langdon', 'It seems I have some time to kill until my dinner with<br/>the senator. Now, what to do in the meantime...?')
('Reporter Langdon', "I get along well enough with the Patriot League's<br/>senators, but compared to the previous administration,<br/>they're much more tight-lipped.")
('Reporter Langdon', "They won't utter a word about matters pertaining to<br/>the Presidential Office. There's a dense air of secrecy<br/>surrounding all that.")
('Reporter Langdon', "Marielle's got no shortage of enthusiasm, I'll give<br/>her that.")
('Reporter Langdon', "But if she can't see reality for what it is, she isn't cut<br/>out to be a reporter. I don't care if that sounds harsh.")
('Reporter Langdon', "Instead of pursuing dreams and fanciful things, she<br/>should be forging relationships with people in<br/>business and politics while she's still young.")
('Reporter Chen', "*sigh* I can't believe San could be so nonchalant<br/>about this.")
('Reporter Chen', "I guess it's nice that I don't need to worry about her,<br/>but...it still depresses me, you know?")
('Reporter Chen', 'She could at least pretend to be bummed out!')
('Reporter Chen', "I heard about what happened with Dingo's<br/>old notebook.")
('Reporter Chen', "Marielle always used to talk about that guy.<br/>Sounded like he had some real guts. I never could've<br/>dug into A's history like that.")
('Reporter Chen', "He was a reporter with conviction. I'm sad I never got<br/>to speak with him while he was alive.")
('Reporter Chen', "Marielle's writeup blew me away. She really put my<br/>stuff to shame.")
('Reporter Chen', 'As someone who mentored her, I feel proud seeing<br/>her come so far, but she also makes me feel like I<br/>could be doing better.')
('Reporter Chen', 'I need to get my act together and step up my game.')
('Reporter Chen', "If I'm not gonna be able to see my sister, then the<br/>least I can do is put out some killer articles for the<br/>Revolution Festival!")
('Reporter Chen', "There have been murmurs that what happened in<br/>Creil might've been an ethnic attack. It's only<br/>speculation for now...")
('Reporter Chen', "...but I ended up telling my sister San about<br/>it anyway. I really shouldn't have done that, though.<br/>She's probably freaking out...")
('Reporter Chen', 'I get the feeling San is taking what I said really hard.<br/>I know she tries not to pay any mind to those sorts<br/>of issues.')
('Reporter Chen', 'Part of my job is to ask questions and explore as many<br/>angles of a potential story as I can.')
('Reporter Chen', 'But I think sharing that with her was the wrong call.<br/>I messed up big time...')
('Reporter Chen', "I wonder if my sister cares about what's been<br/>happening with Judith Lanster.")
('Reporter Chen', "I'm worried one of the editors is going to ask me to<br/>write up a story about that, and I really, REALLY<br/>don't want that to happen.")
('Reporter Chen', "At some point, everybody at the company's taken to<br/>calling me 'super gofer,' and I want them to<br/>stop already. *sigh*...")
('Reporter Chen', 'I interviewed Walter Huckberry earlier today. We did<br/>it at a pretty relaxed location, but I still tried to be<br/>careful with what I said.')
('Reporter Chen', 'Still, he was definitely a nicer guy than I<br/>was expecting.')
('Reporter Chen', "I've come away from that interview feeling like I can<br/>write a deep, insightful piece about him. Now I just<br/>need to put it all together!")
('Reporter Chen', "It's strange. I don't usually get so fired up when I'm<br/>doing an assignment like this.")
('Reporter Chen', "I better take that feeling and run with it! I've gotta get<br/>all my thoughts down while they're still fresh in<br/>my mind!")
('Reporter Chen', 'Great. I get to write a column for the business pages.<br/>Yaaaaaay...')
('Reporter Chen', "I guess it's fallen on me to do some interview piece on<br/>a celebrity.")
('Reporter Chen', "The editor figured it'd be a cinch for someone from<br/>the literature section, but honestly, I suck at these<br/>kinds of things.")
('Reporter Chen', "Makes me wish I was more like Marielle. She can just<br/>dive headfirst into anything like it's no big deal.")
('Reporter Chen', "Guess I better do some research on the interviewee<br/>before we meet so I can sound like I know what I'm<br/>talking about...")
('Reporter Chen', 'Oh. I just realized Marielle disappeared on me again.<br/>Where did she go this time?')
('Reporter Chen', "I really would've preferred to be done with my work<br/>by now.")
('Reporter Chen', 'Unfortunately, the other editors like to think<br/>literature section guys like me have all the time in<br/>world, so they hoist their crap on me.')
('Reporter Chen', "The news section's especially bad. I end up hearing<br/>about things I reaaaaaally would rather not<br/>know about.")
('Reporter Chen', '*sigh* That Marielle... I was something of a mentor<br/>to her for a time. She has a way of scaring me when<br/>she gets into trouble.')
('Reporter Chen', 'I guess I kind of think of her as another younger<br/>sister. It can be hard to concentrate on my work<br/>once I start worrying about her.')
('Reporter Chen', "I respect her drive, of course. I just wish she'd think<br/>things through ahead of time.")
('Reporter Chen', 'Why do the editors always choose to dump work on<br/>me right before a deadline?')
('Reporter Chen', "Do I just look like I have oodles of time to spare?<br/>I'm a journalist, you know—not some author writing<br/>the Great Calvardian Novel.")
('Reporter Chen', "Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be able to fix dinner<br/>for my sister tonight. What a bummer...")
('Receptionist Rianna', 'Editor-in-chief Sullivan is working hard to confirm<br/>the situation in town.')
('Receptionist Rianna', "For my part, I'm trying to gather information and<br/>reach out to as many different people and entities as<br/>I can.")
('Receptionist Rianna', "I want to offer as much support as I can, especially<br/>for Marielle. Nothing's going to stop me from doing<br/>what I can!")
('Receptionist Rianna', 'Thank you all for your help. It was total chaos around<br/>here, and nobody knew what to do.')
('Receptionist Rianna', "I'm still concerned, though. A handful of reporters<br/>were out of the office when everything started<br/>happening...including Marielle.")
('Receptionist Rianna', "I hope she's doing okay. I'm really scared for her...")
('Receptionist Rianna', 'Our reporters are always as busy as can be whenever<br/>the Revolution Festival rolls around.')
('Receptionist Rianna', "I don't have it much easier, either. I have to collate a<br/>ton of information and field a never-ending stream<br/>of questions.")
('Receptionist Rianna', "But I'm choosing to look at it like this: we only have<br/>our hands full because so many people are enjoying<br/>the festival.")
('Receptionist Rianna', "After dealing with such an unfortunate tragedy, it's<br/>good to keep yourself busy, I think.")
('Receptionist Rianna', "Our reporters are still conducting follow-up<br/>investigations into what took place, but we're also<br/>preparing for the Revolution Festival now.")
('Receptionist Rianna', "The festivities are shaping up to be different from<br/>previous years, and there are sure to be tons<br/>of announcements. Everyone's going all out.")
('Receptionist Rianna', "It's so wonderful that Dingo's notebook was able to<br/>be recovered.")
('Receptionist Rianna', "Marielle hasn't been her usual peppy self lately, but I<br/>think she's finding her groove again thanks to that.")
('Receptionist Rianna', 'I can finally breathe a sigh of relief.')
('Receptionist Rianna', "Marielle's on a roll. She broke the stories about the<br/>end of that mafia gang and the arrest of that<br/>big-time president.")
('Receptionist Rianna', "She's becoming one heck of a reporter. It's kind<br/>of unbelievable.")
('Receptionist Rianna', "I mean, I know she couldn't have done it all on her<br/>own or anything, but it's still pretty astonishing.")
('Receptionist Rianna', "In any case, I think Dingo can rest in peace knowing<br/>Marielle's doing okay.")
('Receptionist Rianna', "Things have been pretty crazy around here lately.<br/>I've never seen anything like it.")
('Receptionist Rianna', "With the area surrounding Creil under lockdown, we<br/>can't send anybody out to do<br/>on-the-ground investigating.")
('Receptionist Rianna', "The editor-in-chief gave a pep talk earlier, so I'm sure<br/>our reporters are fired up to dig up something.<br/>I doubt it'll be easy, though.")
('Receptionist Rianna', "I've got a feeling this whole crisis could turn out to be<br/>a sink-or-swim moment for our paper.")
('Receptionist Rianna', "Right now, I'm in the midst of compiling the names<br/>of the people believed to have been caught up in<br/>the attack.")
('Receptionist Rianna', "One name that's come up is Dingo Brad, that<br/>reporter for Meld Magazine...")
('Receptionist Rianna', "I'm really worried about Marielle. I know how close<br/>the two of them were. Poor girl...")
('Receptionist Rianna', "Marielle's got the day off today. She said she was<br/>going out to lunch with somebody, I thi—")
('Receptionist Rianna', 'Wait a minute... WAIT A MINUTE! Could it be<br/>who I think it is?!')
('Receptionist Rianna', "Oooh, I'm crossing all my fingers and toes for her!<br/>Go get him, girl!")
('Receptionist Rianna', "Chen looked pretty stressed earlier. I'm guessing the<br/>editors thrust some assignment on him that's outside<br/>his wheelhouse.")
('Receptionist Rianna', "In some ways, he's the opposite of Marielle.<br/>He's always down on his luck, but it's like she's<br/>blessed with it.")
('Receptionist Rianna', 'That said, it did sound like he had some sort<br/>of success. I hope the final article turns out great!')
('Receptionist Rianna', "I was so scared for Marielle when I heard she'd gotten<br/>kidnapped in Tharbad.")
('Receptionist Rianna', "Thankfully, it doesn't seem like she's traumatized<br/>about it or anything. I'm relieved she's still the same<br/>old Marielle.")
('Receptionist Rianna', "She even snagged herself a big story for the road.<br/>I'm so proud of her.")
('Receptionist Rianna', "I've realized she's pretty strong in her own way.<br/>She never loses heart and always keeps her eyes<br/>looking straight ahead.")
('Receptionist Rianna', 'Marielle took off earlier today. She was positively<br/>brimming with energy.')
('Receptionist Rianna', "It's great that she's so passionate about her job, but<br/>I'm worried she's pushing herself too hard.")
('Receptionist Rianna', 'When she got attacked by that monster, for instance,<br/>she came back to fetch a change of clothes and got<br/>right back into the field.')
('Receptionist Rianna', 'And then she extended her stay in Langport last<br/>month without getting permission. She may have<br/>some trouble in her future...')
('Receptionist Rianna', "It's wonderful that Marielle's so passionate about her<br/>job, but I'm concerned she'll run into some trouble in<br/>the future...")
('Receptionist Rianna', 'Hey, now that I think about it, Marielle seems<br/>awfully interested in that reporter from<br/>Meld Magazine. Could she...?')
('Receptionist Rianna', "No, I shouldn't let preconceptions cloud<br/>my judgment. Knowing her, she's probably just<br/>being tenacious. I'm... I'm sure that's it.")
('Receptionist Rianna', "The Tyrell Times is a media organization with a lot<br/>of history behind it. It's probably the most trusted<br/>name in news within the Republic.")
('Receptionist Rianna', "Lately, we've been partnering with other entities to<br/>get our work on radio, online news broadcasts, and<br/>outdoor screens.")
('Receptionist Rianna', "In case you didn't know, the Tyrell Times has been in<br/>business for over a century. We supported the<br/>democratic revolution when that took place.")
('Receptionist Rianna', "In fact, editor-in-chief Sullivan's own grandfather is<br/>said to have been in charge of reporting on Sheena<br/>Dirke himself. Isn't that amazing?")
('Receptionist Rianna', "Welcome to the Tyrell Times! If you need to speak<br/>with one of our reporters or editors, I'll be more than<br/>happy to set up a meeting.")
('Receptionist Rianna', 'Unfortunately, our editors are all rather busy, so they<br/>may not be able to see you right away.')
('Receptionist Rianna', "Though if you're here to offer your thoughts or<br/>opinions on the paper itself, I'll be more than happy<br/>to listen and pass your comments on.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "I've been so busy, I haven't been able to stay on top of<br/>what's been playing at the theater.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "So, Dingo. Which movie have you got your eye on?<br/>And what's your favorite genre? Tell me, tell me!")
('Dingo', "*sigh* I didn't come here to be interviewed,<br/>you know.")
('Dingo', "But I might as well check something out while<br/>I'm here.")
('Dingo', "I think there's some sort of documentary-ish thing<br/>they're showing. Maybe I'll watch that.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'I told everyone at the Tyrell Times about Dingo and<br/>his notebook.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "That thing is full of information on the Gardens<br/>and A. I can't believe he dug all that up on his own.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'The chief was totally shocked. She said that reporters<br/>as good as him are...a rare thing...')
('Van', 'Yeah. He was the best of the best.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', '*sniffle* It... It all makes me want to follow in his<br/>footsteps even more now.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Even if he won't be there to see it when I finally catch<br/>up to him...")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "*sniffle* *sob*... I'm so sorry. I'm such a mess<br/>right now. I cry at the drop of a hat lately...")
('Van', "It's okay. Ain't no shame in grieving.")
('Van', "We just have to make sure to remember those words<br/>of his—and we've gotta heed 'em, too.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "*sob* Yeah... You're right.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "This notebook is the last thing Dingo left behind.<br/>I'll make sure his findings won't go to waste!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Oh, and speaking of the notebook, one of his theories<br/>he wrote about has been weighing on my mind.')
('Van', "Is it the part about Dantès' thirst for fear and where it<br/>comes from?")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Yeah. For better and for worse, he's led an<br/>unimaginable life—being descended from the royal<br/>family and also part of the D∴G cult.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "We also can't forget the sword he wields is an artifact.<br/>I have to wonder if his background has anything to do<br/>with that obsession of his.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "It seems like Dingo might've had some idea about it,<br/>but he didn't go into it much in his notes...")
('Van', '...')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "*sigh* It's impossible to know what he was thinking.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Anyway, I plan to pick up where he left off. If you<br/>guys come across anything, definitely let me<br/>know, okay?')
('Van', "You bet. We'll be in touch.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "This notebook is the last thing Dingo left behind.<br/>I'll make sure his findings won't go to waste!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "I'm going to look into that theory he had. Maybe I<br/>can come up with some answers.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Oh, it's you guys. Umm... Great job, everyone!<br/>You all really saved the day back in Oración.")
('Agnès', 'Thanks. You were a big help, too.')
('Agnès', "Without you, I doubt we would've been able to get all<br/>those kids on the airship.")
('Van', "I've noticed you've been keepin' busy lately.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Yeah, you could say that. I had a lot of investigating<br/>to do once those revelations about Oración came<br/>to light.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "And it was all worth it in the end. I feel like I'm<br/>finally making a difference.")
('Van', "Good for you. Now Dingo's got one less thing to<br/>worry about up there.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "I sure hope so. If I'm that much closer to becoming<br/>the sort of reporter he was, I'll take it!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'I hope this article has brought me one step closer to<br/>his level. Even the editor-in-chief complimented me<br/>on it.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "I just wish I could've said something to him before he<br/>was gone...")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Ugh. What am I even saying? Dingo's never going to<br/>be able to rest in peace if I let myself get hung up on<br/>what ifs.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'A lot of stuff went down while I was in Tharbad, but<br/>I got a great article out of it. It was all worth it in<br/>the end!')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "I wonder if Dingo's read it yet. That'd make<br/>me happy.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', '*sigh* I was looking into the exact story that made the<br/>front page this morning.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Oh, well. No use crying over spilled milk. I've just<br/>gotta go out there and find another story!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "It's a brand new day! Time to get to work! Oh, and I<br/>better see what Dingo's up to as well.")
('Van', "(Nothing keeps this girl down for long, does it? I feel<br/>sorry for Dingo for whatever she's got in store for<br/>him in the near future.)")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Oh, I almost forgot. It's my turn to come up with an<br/>article for the culture section.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "It's not exactly the part of the paper I'm most<br/>interested in, but I'm sure I'll find something<br/>newsworthy if I nail the interview!")
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', "Meld and Tyrell might approach things differently,<br/>but that's not to say we don't see eye to eye on<br/>anything at all.")
('Editor-in-Chief Cunning', "I've got Dingo and Marielle to thank for helping me<br/>to realize that.")
('Odette', "Umm... I don't... GRRAAAH! This stupid piece of<br/>junk is driving me crazy!")
('Odette', "O-Oh, uh... Everything's under control! We got the<br/>communication systems up and running.")
('Odette', "We'll hold down the fort here. You go do what you<br/>have to do, Agnès.")
('Odette', "I'll admit that I'm worried about you, but I know this<br/>is something you have to do.")
('Agnès', "Thanks for understanding. Just sit tight! We'll put a<br/>stop to this and be back in no time!")
('Odette', "I have no idea what Renne's trying to do on her end.")
('Odette', "But what I do know is that we can't leave all the hard<br/>work to you and Van!")
('Odette', "That's why we're going to do everything we can<br/>to help. You guys just focus on making it back here in<br/>one piece!")
('Agnès', "Right! You all stay safe! We'll be back soon!")
('Odette', 'Albert got attacked by monsters while trying to<br/>save Agnès...')
('Odette', '...But forget about us! You need to go find Agnès!')
('Odette', "At this point, you're the only one we can turn to<br/>for help...")
('Van', "Don't worry, I'm on it.")
('Van', "I'd be a shit boss if I wasn't prepared to do whatever it<br/>takes to keep her safe!")
('Odette', "Don't worry about things over here! Albert's injuries<br/>aren't that serious.")
('Odette', 'Now get on out there and save Agnès!')
('Odette', "You found the perfect sweets for us to try out, Van!<br/>Thanks so much! This meetup's gonna be a big hit!")
('Odette', "All that's left is to find the perfect costume for<br/>you, Van. Then you can join in on the fun, too. ㈱")
('Odette', 'Anyway, let me know what day works best for you.<br/>I wanna get this ball rolling!')
('Odette', "I finally found the roaming café that everyone's been<br/>talking about!")
('Odette', 'I love me a good café, so when I heard about it, I<br/>KNEW I had to come see it!')
('Odette', "Turns out, it's just as nice as everyone says!<br/>The drinks are to die for! ♪")
('Agnès', "Heehee. Sounds like it was worth the trip. I'm happy<br/>for you, Odette.")
('Odette', "I can tell you're busy with work right now, but don't<br/>forget to take a break yourself when you can!")
('Odette', "This is a cute little place! Also, Shino's drinks<br/>are KILLER! I love it here!")
('Odette', "(Albert doesn't seem to be having as much<br/>fun, though. I think I'll give him some space.)")
('Odette', '(Our Student Council work has kept us really busy, so<br/>I was hoping he could take this chance to rest<br/>and relax.)')
('Odette', "When you're on the Student Council, it's always<br/>important to be there for people when they<br/>need advice.")
('Odette', "Oh, and it's equally important to take a breather, too!<br/>We try to work in some fun when we can.")
('Agnès', 'Oh, hi there, everyone.')
('Odette', 'Hey, Agnès! You on the clock right now? I hope your<br/>boss is looking out for you!')
('Van', "Eh. She can handle herself just fine without<br/>me babysitting. Anyway, what're you kids up to?")
('Julian', "We were just talking about next week's school event.")
('Chignon', "Julian's an exchange student, so we wanted to<br/>answer any questions he might have about it.")
('Odette', "We're also going over the merits of each plan, as well<br/>as their budgetary needs.")
('Odette', "Everything's still up in the air, though. We haven't<br/>exactly settled on anything yet. Whoops!")
('Agnès', "Ahaha... Why am I not surprised?<br/>(Not that I'm in any position to criticize...)")
('Risette', 'Well, at least you all seem to be enjoying yourselves.')
('Julian', "For sure. Chances like this don't come around often,<br/>so we're taking our time.")
('Renne', "It won't take me long to get the orbal net back up<br/>and running.")
('Renne', "And it'll take even less time if I can get some help.")
('Renne', "I'm not sure if it'll help us much with reaching<br/>Almata—at least, not on its own.")
('Renne', "But I'll try to think of something. In the meantime, I<br/>wish you all the best of luck.")
('Agnès', 'You, too. Stay safe!')
('Van', "Now's your chance to show us what you're made of!")
('Renne', 'You must be having a slow day if you had time to<br/>help us. Must be hard for you to find work when<br/>things are so peaceful.')
('Renne', 'Having said that, I feel a little restless, even though<br/>the worst of it should be behind us...')
('Renne', "...Don't mind me. I'm sure it's nothing. I have a bad<br/>habit of overthinking things.")
('Van', '(Hmm... Her instincts are usually on point, though.)')
('Van', '(...)')
('Renne', 'Heehee. I can understand why the others are<br/>so excited.')
('Renne', 'The act of preparing a tea party can be<br/>quite enjoyable.')
('Renne', 'Finding the perfect cake, brewing the right tea...<br/>What more fun could a girl ask for? ㈱')
('Van', "I think your idea of fun's a little different from<br/>everyone else's.")
('Albert', 'The police, bracers, and volunteers in different<br/>districts are already on the move.')
('Albert', "Those devils are finally thinning out, thankfully, but<br/>there's still the Vantail District to worry about...")
('Albert', "Even so, I'm going to do everything within my power<br/>to help everyone.")
('Albert', "As for you, Agnès...just promise me you'll come<br/>back safe.")
('Agnès', 'I promise.')
('Agnès', "We'll return once we've saved the city!")
('Albert', 'All right. Odette and I will be waiting for you!')
('Albert', "I'm having trouble making sense of everything, but I<br/>can't let that get to me. I have work to do.")
('Albert', 'Odette and I will do whatever we can to help Renne!')
('Albert', "I won't ask what's going on with you, Agnès.<br/>Just please don't go overboard with whatever you have<br/>to do.")
('Agnès', "Of course. I promise I'll be careful.")
('Albert', "Gah. I'm so...worthless! If I'd acted more quickly,<br/>Agnès and Renne would've been safe...")
('Albert', 'Please... You have to help them!')
('Albert', "I'll admit, you managed to bring us better sweets than<br/>I anticipated.")
('Albert', "But don't get the wrong idea. This does NOT mean<br/>we're good now! Not by a long shot!")
('Van', "Yeah, yeah. It wouldn't be a day on the job if I didn't<br/>have you yelling my ears off at least once.")
('Albert', "I have no idea what's going on right now, but<br/>whatever happens, be careful, Agnès.")
('Albert', "Don't forget, we're your friends, too. We'll always be<br/>here for you if you need to talk to us.")
('Albert', 'Hey, umm...Agnès?')
('Agnès', 'Hmm? What is it?')
('Albert', "N-Never mind. It's nothing.")
('Albert', "*cough* Glad to see your work's...erm...going well.<br/>Stay safe out there, all right?")
('Van', "(Am I seeing things, or is this kid startin' to change<br/>his tune?)")
('Agnès', '(Yes. He and I had a bit of a talk after our trip<br/>to Basel.)')
('Agnès', "(He should fully understand now that I'm proud to be<br/>working with you—and that nobody's forcing me to<br/>do so.)")
('Quatre', "(Oh, I didn't know you told him that.<br/>But still...)")
('Albert', "(There's always a chance something could still happen<br/>to Agnès! I need to be ready to protect her at a<br/>moment's notice!)")
('Van', "(I, uh...don't know if that talk was all that<br/>effective, Agnès.)")
('Agnès', "(S-Sure it was! He just needs a little more time to<br/>accept it, that's all.)")
('Albert', "When I agreed to tag along with Odette on her<br/>café-hopping trip, I didn't expect to end up at a place<br/>like this.")
('Albert', "It's pretty calm and relaxing, I'll admit. Definitely a<br/>good place to do some thinking.")
('Albert', 'Hey, listen, Agnès. Just...try to stay out of danger,<br/>all right?')
('Albert', 'If you run into any problems, you can always come<br/>talk to us. You know that, right?')
('Albert', "H-Hey! You're that spriggan!")
('Albert', 'Why are you here? No, more importantly, why are<br/>you dragging Agnès around town? Huh?!')
('Van', "Oh, great. It's the annoying, stick-in-the-mud kid.<br/>Didn't realize you worked here.")
('Van', "Don't point fingers at me. I'm just earnin' my keep,<br/>and she decided to tag along for the ride.")
('Albert', "Grr... I'm warning you! You better not—")
('Agnès', 'Umm... Albert? I think you might want to use your<br/>inside voice.')
('Feri', "Yeah. It's rude to yell at people, y'know.")
('Aaron', 'Screaming at customers is a quick way to get<br/>yourself fired.')
('Albert', 'Sh-Shut up! I mean, uh...shut up.')
('Albert', 'Listen. If you put Agnès in ANY danger at all, I will<br/>have some choice words for you. VERY choice words.<br/>Understand?')
('Van', 'Loud and clear, kiddo.<br/>(Miiight be best to keep everything that happened in<br/>Tharbad under our hats.)')
('Risette', '(Indeed. I also doubt he would be too pleased to learn<br/>of our numerous skirmishes with the mafia.)')
('Agnès', "(Right... I'll make it a point to be careful what I say<br/>around him.)")
('Albert', "I just can't bring myself to trust someone as shady<br/>as you.")
('Albert', "If anything happens to Agnès, you're going to have to<br/>answer to me! Understand?")
('Albert', "Okay, now to check our inventory. If I'm smart about<br/>this, I might be able to get this done ahead<br/>of schedule.")
('Albert', '*sigh* Why in the world did she need to get a job?<br/>Maybe Renne might know something about this.')
('Van', "(Looks like someone who goes to Aramis. Why's he<br/>workin' at this bookstore?)")
('Van', "(I'm curious—but not enough to ask. I'll just leave<br/>him be.)")
('Albert', "She wouldn't go out and get a job unless it was for a<br/>good reason...")
('Albert', "Hmph. I'm going to have to talk to Renne about this<br/>when I get back.")
('Agnès', 'Albert! And Lyle, too!')
('Lyle', "What's up, Agnès? You working hard?")
('Lyle', "I'm on my way to work myself. I just swung by here<br/>real quick to check up on Albert.")
('Albert', "Not that I asked you to...but I understand, given all<br/>that's happened.")
('Albert', "Anyway, I know I'm always bugging you about this,<br/>but seriously, don't do anything too dangerous, okay?")
('Albert', "I get that what happened in Basel was an unavoidable<br/>emergency, but that didn't stop me from being scared<br/>out of my mind for you.")
('Albert', 'If anything happened to you, I... I...')
('Agnès', "Oh, Albert. I'm so sorry. I'm always making you<br/>worry, aren't I?")
('Albert', "N-No, that's not... Ah, don't be sorry! I didn't mean<br/>to make you feel—")
('Lyle', "Hoho. I've never seen you so hot and<br/>bothered before.")
('Lyle', 'I think you should have a little more faith in Agnès.')
('Lyle', "After all, respecting a woman's feelings is the fastest<br/>way to her heart. Or so they say, anyway.")
('Albert', "And here I thought you were going to have<br/>something insightful to say for once. I should've<br/>known better.")
('Albert', "Anyway, I'm not here to stop you. Just know that<br/>we're here for you if you need anything, all right?")
('Agnès', 'Of course. Thank you, Albert.')
('Odette', "While Van and Agnès are running around town,<br/>we've got to start ironing out the specifics of this<br/>whole event.")
('Odette', "I think the first thing we should discuss is how we're<br/>going to kick things off.")
('Albert', 'Good idea. We have to come up with a way to hook<br/>everyone right off the bat.')
('Albert', 'The only question is how... If only we knew of a book<br/>on this subject.')
('Hermès', "Don't worry about me. I can shake those devils<br/>off my tail no problem.")
('Hermès', "I'll take care of the kids. I know a safe route that'll get<br/>us all out of harm's way.")
('Hermès', "Now, go knock 'em dead. I believe in you—and so<br/>does everyone else!")
('Graham', "Hey, it's you guys!")
('Junifer', "I'm glad to see you're all okay!")
('Van', "Same to y'all.")
('Van', "I heard you guys've been ferryin' people around.<br/>Nice going.")
('Van', "Didn't expect to see you workin' together with<br/>Hermès, though.")
('Hermès', "We're all well acquainted at this point. I was doing<br/>the same thing earlier, and we happened to bump<br/>into each other along the way.")
('Hermès', "We're just about to head back to Riverside<br/>to resupply.")
('Hermès', "From there, we'll split up and circle around town.<br/>Let me know if you want me to pick up anything for<br/>you all.")
('Hermès', "I know time isn't exactly on our side, but it might be<br/>good to take a second to stock up.")
('Aaron', "Yeah. Guess it can't hurt.")
('Junifer', "To be honest, we don't really know what's going on...")
('Junifer', "...but I can tell you're all fighting to get this city back<br/>to normal.")
('Graham', "We'll be happy to help out. You've already done so<br/>much for us, so it's time we return the favor!")
('Van', "Thanks, guys. I'll let you know if we need anything.")
('Inspector Daswani', 'You all again? I would not recommend loitering<br/>around in here.')
('Inspector Daswani', "As far as I'm concerned, you're just as suspicious as<br/>the people running this joint.")
('Inspector Daswani', "Keep your sleuthing around to a minimum if you<br/>don't want to end up on the wrong side of the<br/>law again. Do I make myself clear?")
('Detective Nate', "Okay! With that out of the way, I can focus on<br/>helping the people who weren't able to get away<br/>in time.")
('Detective Nate', "Wish I had more than my measly pistol with me, but<br/>you've got to make do with what you have.")
('Detective Nate', "I can't have you guys making us cops look bad all the<br/>time—especially at a time like this!")
('Detective Nate', "I'm going to leave the security of this area to these<br/>two ladies here and figure out my next move.")
('Detective Nate', "I've gotta trust that Inspector Daswani is<br/>getting to work on his end.")
('Detective Nate', "It's now or never! Time to show everyone what a real<br/>policeman is made of!")
('Detective Nate', "W-Within reason, of course! If I sense any danger<br/>coming, I'll be sure to run to safety!")
('Detective Nate', "And here I was, thinking I could have a nice, normal<br/>movie date. Why couldn't the world choose a<br/>different day to go to shit?!")
('Detective Nate', 'Oh, well. Never mind that! Right now, I just need to<br/>focus on keeping the people here safe!')
('Detective Nate', "I don't know what you guys are planning, but be<br/>careful out there, all right? Don't do anything stupid!")
('Detective Nate', 'Baby, please! I promise to have eyes only for you from<br/>now on!')
('Detective Nate', "I'm begging you! Just give me another chance! I'll<br/>do anything! Anything!")
('Detective Nate', "Gah! ANOTHER breakup at this place?! I've got the<br/>worst luck of any man in Edith...")
('Detective Nate', "The inspector sure is pushing his luck. I'm sure<br/>the higher ups will have a few choice words for him<br/>if they hear about this.")
('Detective Nate', "But at least it's more productive than lazing around at<br/>the station.")
('Detective Nate', "Plus I've got a score to settle with Almata for what<br/>they pulled on us back in Tharbad.")
('Detective Nate', 'Hell, the more I think about it, the more I feel like I<br/>HAVE to go along with the inspector! Count me in!')
('Detective Nate', "Okay! I may be single again, but that just means I'm a<br/>free man! Now, time to start meeting some<br/>new people!")
('Detective Nate', '(Huh? Did they just...frown at me? Nah, I must be<br/>imagining things.)')
("Nate's Girlfriend", "Nate popped in and told me he had something to do<br/>and then ran off. I'm guessing he went down to the<br/>police station.")
("Nate's Girlfriend", "It's strange. Even though he was leaving me behind,<br/>he looked really...striking, taking off like that.")
("Nate's Girlfriend", "That settles it. If Nate is fighting his fears in order to<br/>help people, then I'll do the same.")
("Nate's Girlfriend", 'There has to be something I can do. Maybe I could<br/>distribute supplies or administer first aid.')
("Nate's Girlfriend", "Nate's keeping watch for us outside. I hope<br/>he's okay...")
("Nate's Girlfriend", "I've never seen him take charge like that before, and<br/>he even protected everyone here.")
("Nate's Girlfriend", 'I thought he was just a pathetic guy who only thought<br/>of himself, but maybe I misjudged him...')
("Nate's Girlfriend", "I think I'll give him another chance.")
("Nate's Girlfriend", "Hmph. Nate is one of the most inconsiderate people<br/>I've ever met.")
("Nate's Girlfriend", 'I mean, he totally stopped paying attention to me<br/>until literally today.')
("Nate's Girlfriend", "And then he asks to hang out like nothing's wrong<br/>between us. The least he could've done was apologize,<br/>but he missed his chance.")
('Officer Karen', 'Hey, Detective. Good to see you!')
('Officer Nancy', "Off to patrol the shoppin' district? You never catch a<br/>break, do you?")
('Detective Nate', "Yeah, I feel like I'm always swamped with work.<br/>Being a detective isn't as easy as it sounds.")
('Detective Nate', "But at least these patrols give me chances to run into<br/>hot babes like you, so it's not all bad!")
('Officer Karen', '(Is he...hitting on us? Eww.)')
('Officer Nancy', "(Ugh. This guy's a walkin', talkin' department<br/>scandal in the makin'.)")
('Detective Nate', "Huh? What's wrong? Why'd you two get all quiet?")
('Owner Mau', "You want information on Edith's<br/>criminal underbelly?")
('Owner Mau', "I think you may have walked into the wrong<br/>place, Inspector. We're just a humble<br/>Eastern restaurant.")
('Inspector Daswani', "Don't give me that bull. I know for a fact that this<br/>place is a front for Heiyue.")
('Inspector Daswani', "So start talking—or we'll have to make you talk.")
('Owner Mau', "Hoho. Is that a threat? Well, you're free to come<br/>down on us all you like, but it won't get<br/>you anywhere.")
('Owner Mau', "I'll say this, though. I respect your determination.<br/>I think I'm starting to understand why your superiors<br/>aren't so fond of you.")
('Owner Mau', 'You hail from the Central East, correct? Every day<br/>must be a battle at your workplace.')
('Detective Nate', "Can it, lady! He doesn't need pity from some mafioso<br/>scum—")
('Detective Nate', 'Wait, this place is a front for Heiyue?! Why am I only<br/>NOW learning this?!')
('Detective Nate', "Man, now I'm bummed out. This is where my last<br/>girlfriend broke up with me...")
('Inspector Daswani', 'Detective. Please shut up.')
('Inspector Daswani', "I'll give you two options: cooperate or don't. I'd pick<br/>the former if you care at all about your future!")
('Owner Mau', 'Hahaha. I like a man who can get fired up.')
('Owner Mau', "Very well. I'll throw you a bone. It's information<br/>that's already known to the CID, but they seem to be<br/>too cowardly to act on it.")
('Detective Nate', "Gah! I REALLY don't like your tone!")
('Inspector Daswani', "Fine. We'll take what we can get. Any information is<br/>better than none.")
('Jack', "So they're trying to spread Pandemonium across the<br/>entire continent, huh? Just how low can those Almata<br/>thugs get?")
('Jack', "Freaking out and cryin' about it won't do any<br/>good, though. We've just gotta buckle up and do<br/>what we can to get through this.")
('Jack', "But remember, don't be afraid to fold if you're<br/>in danger. Gamblin' with your lives ain't worth it.")
('Van', "Right. I'll keep that in mind.")
('Jack', "Sorry 'bout before. I'm just a little bit rattled about<br/>everything that's going down.")
('Jack', "You guys seem to know what's goin' on with those<br/>weird spheres, so I'll leave them to you.")
('Jack', "Just don't get yourselves killed out there. Got it?")
('Jack', "You're bein' real aggressive with your bets.")
('Jack', 'Fess up. Did you rig the deck?')
('Halle', 'Who can say? Just remember that if I win, you have<br/>to pay for everything today. And no drinking until we<br/>get home!')
('Jack', "Hey! That's not fair! You're killin' me here, Halle!")
('Halle', "I was really surprised to hear you were involved in<br/>that whole mess. I never would've guessed.")
('Halle', "But I get that everyone has things in their past they'd<br/>rather keep to themselves. You won't hear anything<br/>else about it from me.")
('Halle', "For now, we've got to work on getting this situation<br/>under control. Good luck, guys! Everything's riding<br/>on you!")
('Halle', "At least those things aren't coming inside. We'd be in<br/>a real pickle if they did.")
('Halle', "Don't worry about the students. I'll look after them.<br/>Just take care of that sphere, and we'll call it even!")
('Halle', "When you're Jack's partner in crime, sometimes<br/>you've gotta be a little indulgent to keep things fresh.")
('Halle', "But that doesn't mean I plan on losing. Not by a<br/>long shot!")
('Halle', "We've got some work to do later, but first, we're<br/>gonna kick back and enjoy the festivities!")
('Van', "Hey. How's that terminal lookin'? Think it's usable?")
('Renne', "Yes. For a consumer-grade computer, it can actually<br/>take a fairly heavy load. It'll do in a pinch.")
('Renne', 'Once I synchronize it with my own computer and the<br/>Xiphas, I should be able to work my magic.')
('Renne', "With any luck, I'll be able to get the network back up<br/>and running in the city.")
('Van', "Nice. That's one problem we can check off our list.")
('Jack', "Based on what we just heard, I'm guessin' this girl's<br/>the famous Kitty.")
('Jack', "I...uhh...kinda doubt there's much we can do to help<br/>her out.")
('Halle', "Maybe, but I'm sure we can make ourselves<br/>useful somehow.")
('Halle', "I think I'll keep an eye on her and see if I can pick up<br/>her techniques.")
('Odette', "*sigh* It feels like we've been completely<br/>forgotten about.")
('Albert', "I know what you mean. Renne seems like she's in her<br/>element for some reason.")
('Albert', "Hopefully we can use the orbal net to check on the<br/>other students once it's back up.")
('Albert', 'It might be chaos incarnate out there, but we still<br/>have to support our fellow students.')
('Odette', "Agreed. We can't sit back and take it easy while<br/>Agnès and Renne do all the hard work! No way!")
('Fan', 'Heiyue will lend as much aid as it can.')
('Fan', "We'll take charge of evacuating the citizens while you<br/>address the root cause of the crisis.")
('Fan', "Best of luck out there. I wish you well in what's<br/>to come.")
('Ashen', "I'm sure you'll be fine if you're with them, but please<br/>try not to be too reckless, okay?")
('Ashen', "I know things aren't looking good out there, but we<br/>all have to stay calm and work together if we're going<br/>to get through this.")
('Aaron', 'Yeah, I know. I hear you loud and clear.')
('Aaron', "But that goes for you, too, you know. You better not<br/>be fantasizing about Cao while you've got important<br/>shit to be doing.")
('Ashen', "I-I wasn't... Wh-Why would you even think that?!")
('Ashen', "(Don't get me wrong, though. I find it incredibly hot<br/>that he's so calm under all this pressure...but still!<br/>I'm focused!)")
('Van', "I don't think you've got anything to worry about.<br/>She's got a good head on her shoulders—even if she<br/>does use it for daydreaming half the time.")
('Cao', "I know you're thinking we must have an ulterior<br/>motive in all of this.")
('Cao', "But I assure you, this situation isn't what our<br/>organization wants, either. If you'd like our assistance,<br/>you need only ask for it.")
('System', 'August 26th, 1208, 8:50PM')
('System', 'Mid-West Zemuria, the Calvard Republic')
('System', 'Somewhere in the Capital City of Edith')
('Feri', 'Say, what is this big building for?')
('Van', "Oh, this is a movie theater. It's where you go to<br/>watch movies. It's been a major attraction in this area<br/>for a while.")
('Feri', '...Uhh?')
('Van', "Sorry, guess this stuff ain't real common outside<br/>Calvard, huh.")
('Agnès', 'Have you ever seen an orbal film, Feri?')
('Feri', "No, but I think I've heard the term once or twice.")
('Feri', "I don't really get the concept, though...")
('Agnès', 'Hmm... How should we explain it?')
('Van', 'Ever seen recorded combat footage before?')
('Feri', "Of course! It's really useful for learning new tactics<br/>and reviewing squad movements.")
('Van', "Well, imagine a bunch of pieces of footage put<br/>together that's all performed by actors. That's<br/>a movie.")
('Van', "Then a movie theater's where you go to watch movies<br/>on really big screens.")
('Feri', 'Oh! The city is amazing!')
('Feri', "I didn't realize there was a place here to see tests of<br/>strength and duels to the death!")
('Van', '...I mean, there are movies like that, yeah.')
('Agnès', "We'll have to explain it more in depth later...")
('Feri', 'I really want to see one now!')
('Feri', 'Too bad, though. We still have work to do.')
('Agnès', '(Hey. When we finish up today...)')
('Van', '(Yeah, yeah. I get you... Hang on, why do I have to<br/>come, too?)')
('Agnès', "(If we're going to be a team, we've got to spend time<br/>together and get to know one another better!)")
('Agnès', '(Plus, they happen to be selling some seasonal churros<br/>at the concessions area in the theater!)')
('Van', '(Erk...)')
('Van', 'What do you want, René?')
('Kincaid', 'How many times must I—oh, I see your second<br/>part-timer has joined you.')
('Kincaid', "My name is Kincaid. I'm an analyst with the CID.")
('Kincaid', "If you're working for Van, I expect this won't be our<br/>last meeting.")
('Feri', "...Yes, I suppose so. It's nice to meet you.")
('Agnès', 'Feri...')
('Van', "Look, I don't really wanna play the blame<br/>game here...")
('Van', "...but there's no denyin' the Eisenschild changed<br/>course 'cause the CID got in their way.")
('Van', "You know that decision ended up costing them their<br/>lives, don't you?")
('Kincaid', "I do—and in the moment, it was the correct decision<br/>to train our personnel, so I won't make any excuses.")
('Kincaid', "Still, the Eisenschild weren't strangers. I had<br/>unofficial connections with them as well.")
('Kincaid', 'On a personal level, I deeply lament what happened<br/>to the Flameeater.')
('Feri', '...')
('Kincaid', 'While words alone cannot make amends for what<br/>happened, there is one thing I can disclose.')
('Kincaid', 'It would seem the group that defeated the Eisenschild<br/>were not mafiosos after all.')
('Feri', 'Huh...?')
('Van', "Now that you mention it, that sadistic bastard<br/>mentioned somethin' about an old haunt.")
('Kincaid', 'Hmm... I think it is safe to say the group you are<br/>referring to and its executive members were involved.')
('Kincaid', "While Almata's members all know how to fight, few<br/>are combat specialists.")
('Kincaid', "Ordinarily, they wouldn't have stood a chance against<br/>a capable company of jaegers like the Eisenschild.")
('Kincaid', 'This is simply a matter of fact.')
('Feri', "...You're right!")
('Van', "Yeah, that's been bothering me, too.")
('Agnès', 'How did they do it, then?')
('Kincaid', 'Whomever was deployed to fight the Eisenschild<br/>must have been exceptional fighters.')
('Kincaid', 'And, again, I know this information hardly serves as<br/>recompense, but for now this is all I can share.')
('Feri', 'I appreciate you telling us.')
('Van', "Anyway, somethin' tells me you didn't just call<br/>to apologize.")
('Kincaid', "Quite right. I'd like to discuss the work you have been<br/>doing for the guild.")
('Agnès', 'Oh.')
('Van', "Been keepin' your ear to the ground, eh? Why am I<br/>not surprised?")
('Kincaid', 'As you know, we at CID do not see the guild as<br/>our enemy.')
('Kincaid', 'Granted, our two organizations handle things<br/>differently—namely, national security<br/>and confidentiality.')
('Kincaid', "Thus there are those within our ranks that wish to use<br/>your recent partnership as a means to besmirch the<br/>guild's reputation.")
('Agnès', '...!')
('Feri', 'Uh-oh...')
('Van', "Heh. Real rich comin' from the department that hires<br/>jaegers for side gigs.")
('Kincaid', "That's politics for you. No matter how many get<br/>burned, there will always be those who wish to play<br/>with fire.")
('Kincaid', 'However, the CID as a whole would not stand to<br/>benefit with a plan like that. Therefore, I have<br/>a proposal.')
('Agnès', "Isn't that...")
('Feri', '...a monster extermination request?')
('Van', 'Aidios, take me now...')
('Kincaid', "Haha. It's as you've surmised: we will be sending you<br/>tasks just as the guild does.")
('Kincaid', "Feel free to handle them however you see fit, and<br/>we'll match the rate the guild is giving you.")
('Van', 'At least sweeten the pot a little, you cheapskate.')
('Kincaid', "I'm paying just enough to keep certain voices in the<br/>department quiet.")
('Kincaid', "And with that, I will bid you adieu. I'm looking<br/>forward to a fruitful business relationship with you all.")
('Van', 'That four-eyed sadist...')
('Agnès', "It did sound like he's covering for us, at least.")
('Feri', 'I got that impression, too.')
('Van', "*sigh* And that's how he gets ya...")
('Van', "Waterway under the Seiden District, huh? That's the<br/>2nd District by the way, Feri.")
('Agnès', "I'm guessing you don't go there often due to the<br/>higher than usual governmental presence?")
('Van', 'Heh. You know me too well.')
('Van', "I'm in no hurry to head over there. It ain't much, but<br/>we can stick it to that jerk for foistin' work onto<br/>us willy-nilly.")
('Van', "Gotta go eventually, though, so we'll head over to the<br/>Seiden District once we finish everything else.")
('Feri', 'Gee, you city people have really complicated lives.')
('Feri', 'At least it means I get to fight a bunch of<br/>strong monsters!')
('Feri', 'Leave the front line to me! I can take on any foe, big<br/>or small!')
('Agnès', "Someone's raring to go...")
('Van', 'Save some of that fire for the monsters, kid.')
('System', 'The main story will advance upon entering the<br/>Seiden District.')
('Albert', 'Is that...?')
('Odette', "What's up?")
('Odette', "Oh, it's Agnès! She must be working today.")
('Odette', "Those two must be the ones she told me about.<br/>But she didn't mention that the guy's a total cutie!")
('Odette', 'Aww. I wish I had a fun part-time job like her.')
('Albert', "Agnès has a job?! Why's this the first time I'm<br/>hearing of it?")
('Odette', "Besties tell each other everything, y'know. What,<br/>you jealous?")
('Albert', "I'm just concerned about my friend, that's all.")
('Albert', 'So, what kind of job is it?')
('Odette', 'I think she said they investigate stuff for people.')
('Odette', "And apparently they're helping her look for<br/>something while they work. That's all I know, honest.")
('Albert', "That's so vague... Are you sure it's not shady?")
('Renne', "I assure you there's nothing to worry about.")
('Odette', 'There you are!')
('Albert', "H-How can you be so certain? Do you know<br/>something we don't?")
('Renne', 'You could say that.')
('Renne', "She came to me about working, and because she<br/>performs her duties so admirably, I told her she's free<br/>to do what she wants on her days off.")
('Renne', "But enough about that. Let's finish our business and<br/>return to school.")
('Renne', 'I bought some excellent tea for you both to try.')
('Odette', "Nice! We've got to grab some scones to go with them.")
('Albert', "H-Hold on! You didn't explain anything!")
('Agnès', "Oh, the sun's setting already.")
('Van', "Don't know about you guys, but I could go for<br/>some grub.")
('Feri', "Me, too. Those churros were a good snack, but I'm<br/>hungry again.")
('Agnès', 'You are a growing girl, after all.')
('Agnès', 'Does anything sound good? There are plenty of<br/>options around—')
('Cao', "If it's a meal you're after, I would be more than happy<br/>to provide.")
('Van', 'Shit.')
('Cao', "It's good to see you again, too, Mr. Arkride.")
('Van', "Cut to the chase. What're you doin' here?")
('Cao', "I'm in Edith to tend to some business—namely,<br/>meeting with you.")
('Cao', 'My associates happen to run an excellent restaurant<br/>just down the way. Perhaps we can continue this<br/>conversation there?')
('Judith', '(I knew something was off about him...)')
('Judith', '(First the CID, and now Heiyue.)')
('Judith', "(It seems like he's figured out my true identity, too.<br/>I'll have to talk to Mom and Grammy about this.)")
('Cao', "My name is Cao Lee, president of Heiyue Trading<br/>Limited. It's a pleasure to meet you both.")
('Feri', "Heiyue? Isn't that...?")
('Van', "Whatever you're thinkin', you're probably right.<br/>Some see 'em as the protectors of<br/>Easterners everywhere...")
('Van', "...but if you ask me, they're the biggest crime<br/>syndicate in the whole Republic.")
('Cao', 'Ours is an organization of many faces.')
('Agnès', "If you don't mind me asking, what can we do for<br/>you, sir?")
('Agnès', "I've gathered that you and Van are acquainted,<br/>at least.")
('Van', "Awfully kind way of puttin' it.")
('Van', "This guy's given me two jobs for Heiyue before.")
('Van', "The mira was good, but he was usin' me plain as day<br/>both times.")
('Van', "Frankly, I was hopin' I'd never have to see his smug<br/>mug ever again.")
('Cao', 'You wound me, Mr. Arkride. Personally, I see great<br/>potential for a mutually beneficial relationship<br/>between you and me.')
('Cao', 'So, might I explain our predicament while we wait for<br/>dinner to arrive?')
('Cao', "The truth is, I'd like you to visit Langport on<br/>my behalf.")
('Van', 'Hmm?')
('Feri', "I think I know this one. It's down south, right?")
('Agnès', "That's right. Langport—sometimes referred to as the<br/>'Dazzling City'—is on the southern coast of Calvard.")
('Agnès', "It's the second most populous city in the Republic<br/>and quite famous for its grand Eastern Quarter.")
('Van', "And for bein' Heiyue's home turf.")
('Cao', 'You see, trouble has been brewing on our doorstep.')
('Cao', 'And not the kind we can simply ask the police or<br/>guild to address, mind you.')
('Cao', 'Nor can our organization commit fully to addressing<br/>it so suddenly.')
('Cao', "With all that in mind, I think what we need is a<br/>spriggan's touch.")
('Van', "Hell no. This reeks of A's bullshit to me.")
('Cao', 'Your nose is as sharp as ever, I see.')
('Cao', "Indeed, last month Almata set up a dummy company<br/>in Langport's New Town.")
('Cao', 'Ever since, people seemingly in their employ have<br/>been picking fights with us at every turn.')
('Cao', 'The growing scale and severity of the conflicts means<br/>that we can no longer overlook their meddling.')
('Van', 'You mafias can take each other out, for all I care.')
('Cao', 'Come now, surely you understand the difference<br/>between us and the likes of Almata.')
('Cao', "We are the great equalizer of Calvard's underworld.")
('Van', 'Tch...')
('Agnès', 'Hmm?')
('Feri', "I'm not too good with math... What do you mean?")
('Cao', 'Unlike most criminal organizations, we at Heiyue<br/>understand the value of order.')
('Cao', 'Yes, our activities are not always above board in a<br/>legal sense...')
('Cao', '...but we have principles.')
('Cao', 'To uphold those principles, we crafted a set of rules.')
('Cao', 'For example, the trade of highly addictive drugs and<br/>human trafficking are strictly forbidden.')
('Agnès', '...')
('Cao', 'We kindly ask that other criminal groups follow our<br/>rules, too.')
('Cao', "This is how the Republic's underworld has remained<br/>stable to this day.")
('Feri', 'So all the other groups do what you say because you<br/>guys are the strongest.')
('Agnès', 'Meaning Heiyue plays as much a part in keeping<br/>order here in Calvard as the police or the guild...')
('Cao', 'Precisely.')
('Cao', "I must say, Mr. Arkride, you've gathered some<br/>promising assistants.")
('Agnès', "Y-You're too kind.")
('Van', "...But now that structure is fallin' apart.")
('Cao', "Correct. As Almata's risen to power in the last few<br/>years, they've become more and more rebellious.")
('Cao', 'Its members have committed no shortage of<br/>atrocities, yet they show no remorse.')
('Cao', 'They are challenging our control, and now lesser<br/>criminal organizations have begun to follow suit.')
('Cao', 'Thankfully, none pose a significant threat—not<br/>yet, anyway.')
('Cao', 'However, if in the future Almata manages to wrest<br/>control away from Heiyue...')
('Cao', '...all bets would be off. The rules would be<br/>rewritten—if not simply thrown out entirely.')
('Cao', 'I could go on, but you undoubtedly understand the<br/>potential consequences by now.')
('Van', "So, what're your honchos plannin' to do?")
('Cao', 'The elders want our offensive to be swift and sure.')
('Cao', 'To that end, we must approach with caution.<br/>Almata is no longer the fledgling organization they<br/>once were.')
('Cao', 'Our timing and avenue of attack will need to be<br/>chosen carefully.')
('Cao', 'We cannot allow their taunting to bait us into<br/>rash action.')
('Van', 'Figures.')
('Cao', 'That said, one of our associates is nothing but rash.')
('Cao', "He's a charismatic young man who's on track to join<br/>Heiyue one day.")
('Cao', "But I'll hold my tongue for now.")
('Cao', "We can discuss the rest once you've eaten and agreed<br/>to help.")
('Van', "Look, I get where you guys're comin' from...")
('Van', ' ...but this sounds like a major pain in the ass.')
('Agnès', '(Again?)')
('Cao', 'Oh?')
('Van', "Anyway! This is a lot to chew on, so how 'bout we<br/>pick this back up tomorrow?")
('Cao', "That won't do. I leave for Crossbell first thing<br/>tomorrow morning.")
('Cao', 'I need your answer here and now.')
('Van', '...')
('Cao', 'That tortured look on your face has me optimistic<br/>about your reply.')
('Cao', "I should mention, though, you'll merely be on deck in<br/>case my other helper chooses to decline.")
('Van', "...You're a real son of a bitch, you know that?")
('Van', 'Is the situation really that bad?')
('Cao', 'More or less.')
('Feri', "(I'm not sure what they're talking about anymore, but<br/>it doesn't sound like it's going well...)")
('Agnès', "(Indeed. I'm not sure what Van will choose to do.)")
('Cao', 'This appetizer features the finest Central Eastern<br/>dried fruits, sourced from Valis and prepared using a<br/>secret recipe.')
('Cao', "Please, help yourself to as much as you'd like.")
('Agnès', 'Is this really dried fruit?')
('Feri', "Not like any I've ever had...")
('Van', "Hang on! I ain't done wi—")
('Feri', "Whoa! It's like an explosion of flavor in my mouth!")
('Agnès', "It's so sweet and flavorful, yet fresh and juicy like it<br/>was just picked, too!")
('Cao', 'This is an extremely rare delicacy that even we<br/>struggled to procure.')
('Cao', "Should you decide to help, I'll see to it that you<br/>receive a care package containing sixteen varieties of<br/>dried fruit.")
('Cao', "That's on top of your monetary compensation,<br/>of course. Consider it a token of our appreciation.")
('Cao', 'So, do we have a deal?')
(500, 'October 3rd, 9:45AM')
(40351, 'Get back heeere!')
(40301, 'N-No! Please!')
(40351, '*pant* This game of cat and mouse is over!')
(40301, 'P-Please wait! I can get the money!')
(40301, 'Just give me three days—no, one day is enough!')
(40351, "I'm done giving extensions!")
(40351, "I've been chasing you around like a damn fool, but<br/>this is the end of the line.")
(40351, "Pay up right now, or you'll be sleeping with<br/>the fishes!")
(40301, 'Eeek!')
('Aaron', "Oookay, that's enough of that.")
('Aaron', "Good job being intimidating and all, but it's way too<br/>early for all this damn noise.")
(40351, 'Wh-Who the hell are you? Scram—this is none of<br/>your business!')
('Aaron', "That's where you're wrong.")
(40351, "Pay up right now, or you'll be sleeping with the fishes!")
(40351, '...?!')
('Aaron', 'Oh, nice. I got a clear shot of your face, too.')
('Aaron', "Look, dude. I get you're a loan shark, but aren't death<br/>threats pushing it a bit?")
(40351, 'W-Wait, are you...?')
(40301, 'Heh heh.')
('Aaron', "Don't worry. I'm not saying you should let your<br/>debtor off the hook, though.")
('Aaron', 'How about you lower his interest rate closer to what<br/>the big three banks give?')
(40301, '...What?')
(40351, "Don't mess with me, kid!")
(40351, "Gah...<br/>(Why can't I move...?)")
('Aaron', 'We can do this the easy way or the hard way.')
('Aaron', "What'll it be?")
(40351, '...?!')
(40351, "F-Fine! We'll give him a fair rate!")
('Aaron', "Job's done. Now pay this guy already so we can be<br/>done with this.")
(40301, 'Uhh...')
(40301, "Can't you just use that video to make him forgive all<br/>of my debt?")
('Aaron', "This isn't a charity, man.")
('Aaron', "If I have to be the mediator, then I'm not<br/>playing favorites. You get me?")
(40301, "I-I get you! I'll pay him right away!")
('Aaron', "That's a wrap. What do you think?")
('Van', "Thought you'd screwed it up like three times there.")
('Feri', 'You really did great, though! Mission accomplished,<br/>as far as I can tell.')
('Agnès', "I wish it could have been solved without intimidation,<br/>but I'm at least glad both sides came to an agreement.")
('Agnès', 'Did you ever have to handle situations like this in<br/>Langport, by any chance?')
('Aaron', 'Sure did. Shit like this happens everywhere.')
('Aaron', "Only difference is that the crooks in Langport play it<br/>safer because they don't want the hammer of Heiyue<br/>coming down on them.")
('Feri', 'Interesting.')
('Agnès', "(I'm not sure how to respond to that...)")
('Aaron', "So what's the verdict, chief? Did I pass the test?")
('Van', '*sigh* Kills me a little to say this, but you did good.')
('Van', "But I've got my eye on you. Botch a job, I'll kick your<br/>ass to the curb, ya hear?")
('Aaron', 'Please! Have a little faith in me.')
('Aaron', "I'll be taking care of your old ass and the girls before<br/>you know it.")
('Aaron', "Heads up, though—I'm a heart-breaker, so don't go<br/>falling in love with me.")
('Agnès', "Ahaha...<br/>(He's serious, isn't he?)")
('Agnès', 'That last comment aside, welcome to the team.')
('Feri', "Don't worry. I'm not interested in you at all.")
('Feri', 'But I am looking forward to improving your<br/>fighting skills. Your form is a little too loose.')
('Aaron', 'You talk a big game, small fry.')
('Feri', "My name's actually Ferida. Oh! But I also go by Feri<br/>if you like that.")
('Aaron', "Meh. I'll call you whatever I want.")
('Feri', 'Hmph.')
('Van', 'This guy...')
('Agnès', 'Heehee. I think the office is going to be quite a<br/>bit livelier from here on.')
('Van', "You're tellin' me.")
('Van', '*sigh* What happened to my rough-and-tumble lone<br/>wolf image?')
('Agnès', 'Ah...')
('Van', "Can't you at least pretend I'm a little cool?")
('Agnès', 'O-Oh, I never thought otherwise!')
('Van', "Anyway, it's almost ten. May as well head back to the<br/>office for now.")
('Aaron', 'Works for me. We can swing by Montmart for an<br/>early lunch.')
('Aaron', "The food's good and all, but I need me some more of<br/>that hot piece of a waitress.")
('Agnès', "Please don't bother Paulette... Though, I will agree<br/>that the food is delicious.")
('Feri', 'That cream stew we had last night was delicious!')
('Seyla', 'Thank you both so much for your help.')
('Lulua', "Yeah! We can't thank you enough!")
('Lulua', "I'll admit at first I was like, 'Really? THAT'S<br/>Elaine's guy?'")
('Lulua', "But the way you two moved in perfect sync<br/>was dazzling! Honestly, I'm kinda jealous.")
('Van', '...Huh?')
('Elaine', 'E-Erm...')
('Seyla', 'Read the room, Lulua!')
('Seyla', "Sorry, please ignore her. Come on, you, let's go.")
('Fie', 'Finish your job already?')
('Van', 'Ah. Hey there.')
('Elaine', 'Sorry for going off on my own, Fie.')
('Fie', "It's no biggie. I'm just glad everything got taken<br/>care of.")
('Fie', "Besides, I've got nooo interest in being a third wheel.")
('Elaine', "Th-That's... We're not...")
('Van', "You're gonna have to go easy on her. She's more<br/>touchy than she lets on.")
('Van', "For example, if you start movin' the conversation just<br/>a little toward her age—")
('Elaine', 'First off, not funny.')
('Elaine', "And second, I'll have you know I am still in my<br/>early twenties.")
('Van', "Of course. My apologies, ma'am.")
('Fie', "Don't feel bad, Elaine. I can be a little sensitive about<br/>my age, too, sometimes.")
('Fie', "Anyway, I'll go report to the guild for you.<br/>Have some fun, you two, okay?")
('Elaine', '*sigh* She can be such a tease.')
('Van', "Ain't she somethin', though? Not every day a jaeger<br/>from a famous corps like Zephyr joins the guild—let<br/>alone one trained by the Purple Lightning.")
('Van', "Shows up and immediately helped out in Tharbad.<br/>And she's got a lot of room to get even better,<br/>I reckon.")
('Elaine', 'Agreed. At this rate, she may even surpass<br/>my records.')
('Elaine', 'Though, sometimes a dour expression crosses<br/>her face. She must miss her friends back in<br/>Erebonia dearly.')
('Elaine', "Regardless, I must admit it's been a massive help to<br/>have her around, and I think she's beginning to settle<br/>in here little by little.")
('Van', 'Heh. Once a Student Council president, always a<br/>Student Council president.')
('Elaine', "You don't get to say that—I was still only vice<br/>president when you were around!")
('Van', 'Pssh. René did things differently, so it was up to you<br/>to play the perfect prez.')
('Van', 'Remember the play we did on the last day of the<br/>festival where you—?')
('Elaine', 'Oh, you do NOT get to bring that up again!<br/>That was all your fault!')
(40302, "Hey, isn't that—?")
(40303, "It's gotta be. I wonder what they're talking about?")
('Elaine', '...')
('Van', 'Sucks to be famous, huh?')
('Elaine', 'It has its pros and cons. When I introduce myself,<br/>sometimes I can make use of my reputation.')
('Elaine', 'Much like how you call yourself a spriggan.')
('Van', 'True enough.')
('Elaine', "Knowing you, I imagine you've already eaten dinner.")
('Elaine', 'I had enough to hold me over...')
('Elaine', '...but I could go for a drink. Want to come with me?')
('Van', 'Well, lookie here...')
('Aaron', "Huh? Isn't this usually locked?")
('Feri', 'It is... Where does this alleyway lead?')
('Van', 'Down into the waterways beneath the Tyrell District.')
('Van', 'Far as I know, the only traffic this way sees is a<br/>maintenance team once a month.')
('Van', "Now, I ain't an ace detective, but something's tellin'<br/>me this wasn't their doing.")
('Feri', "The handle's gone...?!")
('Agnès', 'This may have been done recently.')
('Bergard', 'Whoever removed it may have inhuman strength.<br/>Or maybe it was a martial artist? Or perhaps...')
('Risette', 'No ordinary person could accomplish this with their<br/>bare hands. Perhaps they employed some sort of tool,<br/>or perhaps...')
('Quatre', "It's safe to say a normal person couldn't do that with<br/>their bare hands. I wonder if they used a special tool,<br/>or maybe...")
('Judith', 'The quickest way to the bottom of this is to head<br/>in ourselves.')
('Quatre', "Why don't we just head inside and find out<br/>for ourselves?")
('Risette', 'I think the most prudent course may be to enter and<br/>discover the truth for ourselves.')
('Van', '...')
('Agnès', 'This handle is broken, too...')
('Aaron', "There's no mistaking it, whoever did this just yanked<br/>the thing clean off.")
('Feri', "Then they didn't use a tool after all...")
('Quatre', "Whoever we're dealing with is far from ordinary.")
('Judith', "We're dealing with a freakish level of strength, then.")
('Bergard', 'What an absurd show of strength.')
('Risette', 'There are a lot of fresh footprints in front of the<br/>door, too.')
('Bergard', 'There are a lot of fresh footprints in front of the<br/>door, too.')
('Judith', 'There are a lot of fresh footprints in front of the<br/>door, too.')
('Aaron', "Heh. Looks like we've got some huge-ass rats to<br/>flush out.")
('Van', 'You got that right.')
('Van', "Let's have a look inside.")
('Van', "Heads up, though—there's no tellin' what's waitin'<br/>for us in there. Be ready for anything, understand?")
('Feri', 'Got it!')
('Agnès', 'We should have time to stock up on equipment and<br/>items if need be.')
('System', "Entering the waterway will end the afternoon's<br/>activities and advance the main story.")
('System', 'All members of Arkride Solutions will participate in<br/>the next dungeon.')
('System', 'The day approached with much suspense both at<br/>home and abroad, for what was to come following a<br/>memorial service set for Creil...')
('System', "...was the unveiling of the Republican Army's next<br/>generation of weapons.")
('System', 'A number of VIPs would soon descend upon the<br/>capital, ready to take part in moments both solemn<br/>and merry.')
('System', "Moving with purpose, they made their way through<br/>one of the Blacklight District's secret passages...")
('System', '...and emerged from a well-concealed exit near the<br/>subway platforms in the Tyrell District.')
('Feri', 'Oh, no...')
('Aaron', "Damn. It's even worse than the south side.")
('Bergard', "I suspected the area close to the source would be<br/>heavily impacted, but I didn't imagine it would be<br/>quite this dire.")
('Risette', 'We appear to have another problem, too.')
('Van', "No kiddin'.")
('Feri', 'A demon sphere!')
('Aaron', 'Out of the pan and into the fire, huh?')
('Van', "Cut the chitchat, we've got company!")
('Risette', 'These foes appear to be of moderate strength!')
('Bergard', 'Indeed. These devils are middle of the pack!')
('Van', "Whatever they are, they're going down! C'mon!")
('Aaron', 'Sheesh. Talk about a welcoming party.')
('Feri', 'We need to be careful, the miasma is thick here!')
('Van', 'Bah, more already?!')
('Van', '(...?)')
('Feri', "Th-They've blocked our retreat!")
('Risette', 'Five new targets confirmed.')
('Bergard', 'I suspect the demon sphere can summon a<br/>neverending cavalcade of foes.')
('Aaron', 'Great...')
('Jack', 'Quick! Come this way!')
('Van', 'Jack! Halle!')
('Feri', "Agnès' classmates, too!")
('Aaron', 'Good to see you all in one piece.')
('Jack', 'Yeah, same here! Now get out of there, already!')
('Halle', 'The monsters will give up if you get far enough away<br/>from that orb up there!')
('Albert', "Urgh... I need to go, Odette! Don't try and stop me!")
('Odette', 'No way! What are you talking about?! You can<br/>barely walk!')
('Odette', 'Can you please help me with him?')
('Van', 'Got this, Master?')
('Bergard', 'Easily!')
('Jack', "So that's really how it is, huh?")
('Jack', "Given the way Heiyue was acting, we figured Almata<br/>had somethin' to do with all this.")
('Halle', "I never thought they'd be capable of something like<br/>this, though.")
('Halle', 'None of this would be happening if Enrique was still<br/>their leader...')
('Jack', "No use thinkin' about that now.")
('Feri', 'Halle...')
('Aaron', "Oh, right. You got mixed up with that guy,<br/>didn't you?")
('Halle', 'Yeah, but thankfully all I ever did was play cards<br/>for him.')
('Halle', "It's been seven years now.")
('Halle', 'Back then, Enrique was the leader of a much less<br/>dangerous Almata.')
('Jack', 'After Enrique bit the dust, Dantès, who was the<br/>number two at the time, took over.')
('Jack', 'He moved the whole operation up north to<br/>Messeldam, and the rest is history.')
('Jack', "...Say, Van. Got a question for you—though I<br/>don't like asking it.")
('Jack', "You met Dantès before he took over Almata,<br/>didn't you?")
('Van', '...What makes you say that?')
('Jack', "I've been in the information game for a long<br/>time now.")
('Jack', "Couldn't help but hear all about when Dantès came<br/>onto the scene nine years back.")
('Jack', "'Cept I never heard a peep about what he was up to<br/>before then.")
('Jack', "Never would've guessed he was a cult leader AND<br/>former royalty at that.")
('Jack', "But that's not why I'm bringin' this up now.")
('Jack', "Both Dingo and I noticed somethin': Dantès joined<br/>Almata and you enrolled at Aramis...")
('Jack', '...at almost the exact same time.')
('Feri', '...Huh?')
('Aaron', 'Come on, Jack. Cut it...')
('Halle', '...Van?')
('Risette', '...')
('Van', "If it were just you, I'd laugh the whole thing off as a<br/>gambler seein' patterns that ain't really there.")
('Van', "But if Dingo picked up on it, too, guess I'm not<br/>that lucky.")
('Feri', "Now that I think about it, Dingo's notes did say<br/>something about a theory...")
('Feri', 'Oh...')
('Aaron', 'He also mentioned not knowing what Dantès was up<br/>to before joining Almata.')
('Aaron', "Don't tell me you two already knew about this?")
('Risette', 'What I know is limited to the contents of his basic<br/>background check with Marduk.')
('Bergard', "...I'll abstain from commenting.")
('Aaron', 'You son of a...')
('Feri', 'E-Easy, Aaron.')
('Van', 'By the way, I first met Master ten years ago.')
('Van', "He was helpin' out with a major international<br/>operation spearheaded by the guild.")
('Aaron', '...!')
('Halle', "Y-You don't mean...")
('Jack', 'And everything finally clicks.')
('Odette', '*sigh* That Albert will not listen to a word I say...')
('Odette', 'Uh... Is something wrong?')
('Van', "Nothin' important. We've got more<br/>pressin' problems.")
('Feri', "Yeah, we still haven't found Agnès yet.")
('Aaron', "The super schoolgirl's not here either.")
('Jack', 'The young miss can actually fill you in on all that.')
('Odette', 'Hmm? Oh, right!')
('Odette', 'You need to help Agnès and Renne! Please!')
('Odette', 'That creepy orb thing sucked them in!')
('Feri', 'What?!')
('Risette', 'Could you start from the beginning?')
('Van', "And don't skimp on the details, anything may be<br/>important here.")
('Odette', "O-Of course. We'd all gathered to discuss the school<br/>festival when that broadcast started...")
('Melchior', 'Witness and cower as this relic ends all things by<br/>ushering in a new dawn: Pandemonium!')
('Agnès', 'Renne!')
('Renne', 'This is certainly unexpected... Everyone, stay on<br/>your guard!')
('Albert', 'Whaaa...?!')
('Odette', 'Wh-What in the world...?')
('Odette', "Everyone's...")
('Albert', '...frozen?')
('Renne', 'Is this some kind of spacetime interference?!')
('Agnès', 'Could it be because of the Genesis...?')
('Albert', 'Whoa!')
('Odette', 'I-Is that an...orb?')
('Agnès', 'Huh?! My Genesis is reacting!')
('Renne', 'Oh, no... Agnès, get away!')
('Agnès', 'Aaaah!')
('Albert', 'Agnès!')
('Odette', 'Nooooo!')
('Renne', 'Ugh!')
('Renne', "It's trying to absorb her into its phase space...!")
('Renne', "...I can't hold on much longer.")
('Renne', 'Albert, Odette, go hide at the Eastern restaurant<br/>down the street!')
('Renne', 'If someone dependable like the spriggan comes by,<br/>tell them what happened!')
('Renne', "We'll be sure to survive until then!")
('Albert', 'Aaaaah!')
('Odette', "M-Monsters?! W-We've got to get out of here!")
('Feri', "Th-That's awful... We've got to go and save them!")
('Van', "Yeah. Even if it's different than the spheres before,<br/>what we've gotta do hasn't changed.")
('Odette', "They're both okay, right?! They haven't been eaten in<br/>there or anything?!")
('Van', "Don't worry. They're just fine.")
('Van', "For one thing, Renne's not about to go down that<br/>easy, but those spheres don't seem like they're out to<br/>hurt anyone to begin with.")
('Jack', "Hmph. I'm curious why you're so sure of that, but I<br/>guess now ain't really the time.")
('Jack', "Just go bring 'em back safely for us!")
('Halle', "We're counting on you guys!")
('Van', "You don't need to tell me twice.")
('Aaron', "Heh. We'll be back before you know it.")
('Van', '...!')
('Feri', 'Ugh...!')
('Aaron', 'How the hell is it pushing us back?!')
('Risette', "It's intensifying!")
('Bergard', "Somehow it's absorbing our mana!")
('Renne', "No... That wasn't me! That wasn't me!")
('Renne', 'Cross? Where are you?! Please, come back...!')
('Agnès', "Renne! You can't lose sight of yourself!")
('Van', "(It's feedin' on her trauma...)")
('Van', '(Damn it. If only I could reach it!)')
('Zin the Immovable', "Looks like we're not a minute too soon.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Hope you're down for us lendin' you a hand.")
('Feri', 'Oh!')
('Van', 'Zin and the Direwolf!')
('Risette', 'Its power has been suppressed!')
('Aaron', 'I can move again!')
('Feri', 'Uh-oh!')
('Bergard', 'Van, the time is now!')
('Van', 'Right! I owe you guys one!')
('Zin the Immovable', "Don't sweat it! Hold down the fort, Walter—I'm<br/>going in!")
('Walter the Direwolf', "I'll give this thing a piece of my mind.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "I've got an old pal in there to save, so I'll leave the<br/>outside to you, Zin!")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Got it. Take care of Arkride and the others!')
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Quit messing with me, ya damn ball!')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Take this! Divine Dragon Fist!')
('Feri', "We're back...")
('Aaron', 'Another sphere done and dusted.')
('Walter the Direwolf', "Heh. You all weren't half bad.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Nice job, everyone.')
('Agnès', 'Are you all right, Renne?!')
('Renne', 'Yes. As soon as we returned I started feeling<br/>much better.')
('Renne', "I wouldn't mind being cradled like a princess for a<br/>while longer, though. ㈱")
('Van', 'Come on, now...')
('Agnès', '*sigh* If you can tease like that, then you really are<br/>back to normal.')
('Odette', 'Heeey!')
('Odette', "I'm so glad to see you both! Is everyone okay?!")
('Agnès', "Odette! Yes, we're fine!")
('Halle', 'Thank goodness.')
('Jack', "Yeah. Glad that spiky-haired softie's still in one piece.<br/>I've got some questions for him.")
('Detective Nate', "That creepy miasma's gone, too.")
('Detective Nate', "But that doesn't mean you should go rushing out on<br/>your own! Be more careful!")
('Van', 'Never expected you two to roll up together. Was that<br/>fist fight before just for show or what?')
('Zin the Immovable', "Of course not. This isn't a formal partnership.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Just happened to run into each other after goin'<br/>around the city.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "That damn Lucrezia still ain't carrying her weight.<br/>A real slacker as always.")
('Halle', 'I remember that name...')
('Jack', "The society's Golden Butterfly, right? You guys really<br/>are free spirits.")
('Jack', "Come to think of it, Renne used to be a member too,<br/>didn't she?")
('Aaron', 'Why save a traitor? Is the Direwolf all bark and no<br/>bite after all?')
('Walter the Direwolf', "Slow your roll, Red. I've known the girl since she was<br/>little. We're practically family.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "And I'm not here to judge her. Long as she's<br/>choosing for herself, that's all that matters.")
('Walter the Direwolf', "Not sure she's totally gotten away from her<br/>past, though.")
('Zin the Immovable', '...')
('Van', "...Can't blame her. How many of us truly have?")
('Van', "I sure as hell haven't, and somethin' tells me you two<br/>and that chief you're friends with haven't either.")
('Walter the Direwolf', '...Heh.')
('Zin the Immovable', "Can't argue with you there.")
('Renne', "Don't you know it's rude to use others as an excuse<br/>for your heart-to-heart talks?")
('Walter the Direwolf', 'Heheh. Sorry, kiddo.')
('Van', "How's the poindexter doin'?")
('Agnès', "Albert's fine, but worn out and in need of rest.")
('Agnès', "I'm just glad the four of us are back<br/>together again.")
('Van', 'Happy for you.')
('Feri', "I-I'm glad we finally found you, too!")
('Agnès', "Aww... It's good to see you again, too, Feri.")
('Agnès', 'And Aaron, Risette, and Bergard...')
('Agnès', 'And Van, too, of course.')
('Aaron', 'Heh.')
('Risette', 'We were deeply concerned for your safety.')
('Bergard', 'Indeed, but we never stopped believing that we would<br/>be reunited once more.')
('Van', "Ugh. That's sappy as hell... Anywho, you ready to<br/>come back to work?")
('Agnès', 'Of course!')
('Halle', 'Heehee.')
('Jack', "Sheesh. Who does he think he's foolin' with that<br/>tough-guy act?")
('Renne', "Oh, I'm sure he realizes we've figured him out<br/>by now.")
('Van', 'I heard that!')
('Van', 'Back to business.')
('Van', "I've got a serious question I've been wantin' to ask<br/>you, Renne.")
('Renne', 'Oh?')
('Agnès', 'Is something wrong...?')
('Renne', 'Are you wondering what Almata is after? Or perhaps<br/>how to restore peace to the city?')
('Renne', "Could it be why some people can move but<br/>others can't?")
('Aaron', '...!')
('Risette', 'Professor Cronkite raised the same issue with<br/>us, actually...')
('Renne', 'The man is a bona fide genius, so color me<br/>unsurprised that he put it together already.')
('Walter the Direwolf', '...Huh?')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Hmm...')
('Van', 'Much as I want to hear all your answers to those, that<br/>last one was what I had in mind.')
('Van', "I've got a hunch, but I need someone who ain't me to<br/>say whether I'm goin' crazy or not.")
('Renne', 'Very well.')
('Renne', "For everyone not in the loop, I'll pose this<br/>as a challenge.")
('Renne', 'Think back—try to recall who you have seen that can<br/>still move since this crisis began.')
('Feri', 'O...kay.')
('Aaron', "Where's this going?")
('Agnès', '...')
('Feri', 'Wait... Th-This has to be a coincidence, right?')
('Aaron', "It's the only thing that makes sense...")
('Bergard', 'If the truth of this matter can be used to resolve this<br/>crisis, we acknowledge it head on.')
('Zin the Immovable', "That's a tough pill to swallow, but you're right.")
('Halle', 'You seriously think the only people who can move are<br/>the ones that know Van?!')
('Walter the Direwolf', "One chat could be the difference between bein'<br/>frozen or not.")
('Van', 'So you guys reached the same conclusion, huh?')
('Van', "Glad I haven't completely lost it yet.")
('Renne', '*sigh* Why did I get saddled with explaining?')
('Renne', 'You could have backed me up, you know?')
('Jack', "Gambling's made my instincts better than most, but I<br/>ain't a scientist.")
('Jack', "Even if I can guess what's happenin', I couldn't tell<br/>you why. Honestly, though, I'd rather continue that<br/>topic from earlier.")
('Feri', 'Oh, right...')
('Agnès', 'I think I heard someone mention it when we<br/>got back.')
('Renne', 'The issue of whether Van and Dantès met before<br/>Dantès joined Almata, correct?')
('Van', "The long and short of it is that while I didn't really<br/>know the guy directly, we did have an<br/>indirect connection.")
('Van', 'Even then, I doubt he even saw me as a human being.')
('Van', "At best, he'd think me a guinea pig. At worst, I was<br/>just an empty husk.")
('Aaron', '...?!')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Wait...')
('Bergard', '...')
('Renne', 'So it really is true...')
('Walter the Direwolf', "Damn. Didn't see that one comin'.")
('Feri', "I can't wrap my head around all this yet.")
('Aaron', 'I remember hearing that those nutjobs were into<br/>human experimentation, but this just...ugh.')
('Risette', '...')
('Agnès', 'Van...')
('Van', "No use mopin' about it now. Got more pressin'<br/>matters to attend to.")
('Van', 'Like how Dantès and his goons are back from the<br/>dead somehow.')
('Van', 'I reckon their goal is—')
('Risette', 'How?! Time is frozen!')
('Renne', "I don't know, but evidently they found a way!")
('Dantès', 'How grand it is to see you all collectively toil ever<br/>closer to the truth.')
('Dantès', "And I suggest you continue to toil, for our banquet's<br/>preparations are progressing swimmingly.")
('Dantès', 'I was content to leave it at that, but Melchior here<br/>informed me that your challenge is not nearly<br/>thrilling enough.')
('Melchior', 'Absolutely! Compared to the fun we had at Oración,<br/>our party here is boooring.')
('Melchior', "So I thought, 'How can we spice this up?' And my<br/>answer for you is simple: the moment this call ends, a<br/>five hour countdown will begin.")
('Dantès', 'Fail to stop us before the clock hits zero, and we will<br/>let loose the hounds of chaos.')
('Dantès', 'That is to say, Pandemonium will not only consume<br/>the Republic, but the continent as a whole.')
('Dantès', "We expect great things of you all, and especially of<br/>our carnival's victors.")
('Dantès', 'May we meet again soon.')
('Melchior', 'Oh, and by the by, I put up a scary-strong barrier<br/>around the Vantail District. Good luck cracking<br/>that one!')
('Melchior', "Here's a little hint: it's linked to those Demon Spheres<br/>all around the city. Break every single one, and maybe<br/>you'll have a chance.")
('Melchior', 'Anyway, toodle-oo! Let the countdown begin! ♪')
('Van', "Gee, how kind of 'em to say when they're gonna<br/>screw us all. Let's get to work, everyone!")
('Agnès', 'Right!')
('Feri', 'Understood!')
('Zin the Immovable', "You're planning to visit the Auber and Seiden<br/>districts, right?")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Leave the suburbs to us, then. Walter, you and your<br/>people are coming with.')
('Walter the Direwolf', "Whatever you say. I'll go let 'em know.")
('Jack', 'Suppose I should lend ya a hand for earlier.<br/>Anything you need, young lady?')
('Renne', "There is. I'd like to get the orbal network up and<br/>running again.")
('Renne', "Surely your information savvy will come in<br/>handy somehow. Frankly, I'll need all the help I<br/>can get.")
('Jack', "Good thing I got that new terminal for work, else I'd<br/>be totally out of my depth.")
('Halle', "See, I told you it was worth the investment. I'm pretty<br/>good with techy stuff, so I'll lend a hand!")
('Odette', 'Count us in, too!')
('Albert', 'The bookstore I work at...*pant* They got a<br/>cutting-edge model just recently!')
('Renne', "Now that's music to my ears!")
('Renne', "If we can reconnect, we'll contact you as soon<br/>as possible.")
('Albert', 'Agnès! Just please, please take care of yourself!')
('Odette', 'Geez Louise, I bet she wants to tell you the same<br/>thing, bucko! Take care of our friend for us, okay?')
('Agnès', 'Everyone sprung into action without a<br/>second thought.')
('Van', 'A little too quick, if you ask me.')
('Feri', "Heehee. We're fortunate to be surrounded by such<br/>good friends.")
('Aaron', "We better hurry our asses up. I'm not letting those<br/>background dancers upstage me!")
('Risette', "Let's set course for the Seiden and Auber districts.<br/>We'll have to find the fastest route in the field.")
('Bergard', "Indeed. Let's roll out!")
('System', 'Agnès rejoined the party.')
('System', 'To advance the main story, either walk to the edge of<br/>the district you are in and choose your next<br/>destination, or select it directly from the Travel menu.')
('Van', "(We're up against the clock now, so we better make<br/>every moment count.)")
('Van', "(Let's hit the Seiden District, then move on to the<br/>Auber District.)")
('System', 'Once a district has been selected, the others will be<br/>temporarily unavailable.')
('Van', "(Judith was in Seiden. Dunno what she would've<br/>done when that countdown started, but we've still<br/>gotta find her.)")
('Van', "(Let's hustle!)")
('Van', 'This is the fastest way to the Seiden District. If we<br/>hoof it on foot, we can probably get there in<br/>20 minutes.')
('Aaron', "Man, what I wouldn't give to have your truck right<br/>now, Van.")
('Aaron', "All these frozen people aren't going anywhere, think<br/>they'd mind if we 'borrowed' a car?")
('Risette', "I don't believe those vehicles can move.")
('Agnès', "AND that's illegal! It's a bit of a run, but I'm sure we<br/>can manage.")
('Junifer', 'Vaaan!')
('Feri', "What's the truck doing here?!")
('Agnès', 'I guess Junifer and one of the street racers decided to<br/>bring it to us?')
('Van', "Now that's what I call a sight for sore eyes!")
('Van', "Oh, right. I did give you guys the keys to do<br/>maintenance on her, didn't I?")
('Junifer', 'Yeah! My uncle filled me in on everything as soon as<br/>I got back to Riverside!')
('Junifer', 'Then some woman named Fie told us where you<br/>were headed.')
('Feri', 'Oh!')
('Junifer', 'Then some man named Kincaid told us where you<br/>were headed.')
('Van', 'That damn meddler.')
('Junifer', 'Then some man named Cao told us where you<br/>were headed.')
('Aaron', 'Dude always shows up at the right moment.')
('Bergard', 'That must have been after we parted ways.')
('Aaron', "I'm just glad our feet are saved!")
('Van', 'For sure. Thanks for the hook up.')
('Junifer', "Oh, don't worry about it! You guys have helped<br/>us plenty.")
('Graham', 'Yeah. You even lent a hand with that race<br/>earlier today.')
('Graham', "We'll send our friends around to make sure your allies<br/>have rides, too!")
('Agnès', 'Thank you!')
('Van', 'All right, next stop: the Seiden District!')
('Renne', 'Of course. I managed to reboot it using a special<br/>resonance device operated by a general-purpose fork<br/>of the Aeon system.')
('Renne', "Not to mention a little help from Marduk's new<br/>service, but let's keep that tidbit between us.")
('Renne', 'Desperate times call for desperate measures, after all.')
('System', 'Van and Agnès retraced the route that she<br/>previously took on her day off.')
('System', 'Their search for the book led them across the city,<br/>including cafés, bookstores, and the subway.')
('System', 'Van got in his pickup truck and drove to the<br/>bookstore located in the Tyrell District.')
('Van', "(Longlai's such a popular tourist attraction, you gotta<br/>figure the local sweets change up over time.)")
('Van', "(Way I see it, I'd be shirkin' my professional duties as<br/>a spriggan if I didn't take the time to study up on<br/>'em beforehand.)")
('Van', '(Now to just find where they keep the tour<br/>guides here. Hmm...)')
('Van', 'Huh? Is that Agnès over there?')
('Agnès', 'Oh! Hi, Van. Fancy seeing you here!')
('Agnès', 'Are you doing your rounds across the city? You seem<br/>to do that a lot at night.')
('Van', "Nah, not this time. I just came here to shop for some<br/>books, that's all.")
('Van', 'What brings you here? I figured you went back to<br/>your dorm after we were all finished talking.')
('Agnès', 'I just remembered a reference book that one of my<br/>teachers recommended to me the other day.')
('Agnès', 'I decided I might as well pick it up on my way back<br/>before I forgot.')
('Van', "Got'cha. That's some dedication if you're goin' out of<br/>your way to pick up that kind of<br/>extracurricular material.")
('Agnès', "I don't know if I'd say I'm that dedicated this time.")
('Agnès', "Otherwise I wouldn't have found myself over here<br/>looking for guidebooks on Longlai.")
('Agnès', "Oh, but if you're here, does that mean...you're looking<br/>for information on the kinds of sweets they have<br/>in Longlai?")
('Van', "You know me only too well at this point. Well, since<br/>we're both here, might as well see what they got.")
('System', 'Once Van and Agnès found the books they were<br/>looking for, they made their purchases and departed<br/>the store.')
('Van', "The subway's probably runnin' less frequently at this<br/>time of day, aren't they?")
('Agnès', "I'd say so. At this hour, they probably—")
('Agnès', "Oh, no... Looks like they're having some sort of<br/>problem with the train cars.")
('Van', "Yeah, I read that earlier. I'm sure they'll be up and<br/>runnin' again soon.")
('Agnès', "Maybe. It says they don't have an estimate for how<br/>long the inspection is going to take.")
('Agnès', "Hmm... I guess I'll either have to wait it out at a café<br/>or just walk home instead.")
('Van', "You don't have to go to all that trouble. I can just<br/>drive you back in my truck.")
('Van', "Beats how long it takes to go on foot. I'm sure your<br/>dorm's got a curfew in place, right?")
('Agnès', "You don't mind? That would definitely help me a lot.")
('Agnès', "Thanks, Van. You're a lifesaver.")
('System', 'Van made his way to the Eastern cuisine restaurant in<br/>the Tyrell District and ordered meat buns for takeout.')
('Van', 'Great. Now to just find somewhere to sit and eat<br/>these bad bo—')
('Van', 'Huh?')
(40302, 'Waaaaaah! Mommy, where are you? Mommy!')
(40301, "Stop crying! This wouldn't have happened if you<br/>hadn't wandered off like that, Mina!")
(40302, 'WAAAAAAH!')
('Feri', "Hey, it's okay, you two. Everything's going to be fine.<br/>I promise!")
('Feri', "Want me to take you guys to the police station?<br/>I'm sure they'll help you.")
(40302, '*sniffle* Really?')
(40302, 'Does that mean my brother and I will...will be able to<br/>go home?')
('Feri', 'Absolutely!')
('Feri', 'For all we know, Abi and Umi could be there waiting<br/>for you two already!')
(40301, "'Abi'...? 'Umi'...? What're those?")
(40301, "Anyway, could you take us there? I don't know where<br/>to find it.")
('Feri', 'Sure! No problem.')
('Feri', "It's not that far away at all. We might even run into<br/>Ab—er, your parents on the way there.")
('Feri', "It's gonna be a little bit of a walk. Will you be okay?")
(40302, 'Y-Yeah!')
('Van', "I knew she said she would be hanging around here,<br/>but I didn't expect to find her helping out like this.")
('Van', "She knows the city pretty well at this point, so there's<br/>probably nothing to worry about, but still...")
('Van', 'Better keep an eye just in case.')
('System', 'Van decided to pay a visit to the bookstore in Tyrell<br/>District and browse through their section on films.')
('Van', "Damn—this publisher works fast. Already got<br/>somethin' out about the Tharbad Film Festival.")
('Van', "Let's see what they say about it... Yep, they were<br/>definitely there and watching the entrants.")
(40301, "Check it out! Another special on Nina Fenly.<br/>That chick's on a roll lately.")
(40302, "I mean, why wouldn't she be?")
(40302, "She stole Judith Lanster's crown as best actress at<br/>the festival. She's gotta be the hottest actress in<br/>Zemuria right now!")
(40301, "Guess it's now Nina's time to be in the spotlight.<br/>Not that I'll stop liking Judith or anything, of course,<br/>but you know what I mean.")
(40302, 'Hell yeah, man! No one keeps the action sexy<br/>like her!')
('Van', '...')
('Van', 'Hey, is that who I think it is?')
('Judith', 'Okay. No time to waste. Time to watch another—')
('Van', "You're watchin' the same movie again? That's gotta<br/>be the third time now.")
('Judith', 'Huh?!')
('Judith', 'Wh-What the heck?! What are you doing here?!')
('Van', "What am I doing here? What are YOU doing, comin'<br/>to this theater and watching your own movie over and<br/>over again? Don't you think that's kinda—")
('Judith', "S-SHUSH! Don't you say another word!")
('Judith', "This isn't a good place to talk! Follow me!")
('Judith', 'Phew. All right—the coast is clear.')
('Judith', "Are you out of your mind? Do you know what<br/>would've happened if people in that theater knew I<br/>was there?! It'd be chaos!")
('Van', "Hey, you're the one who blared your horn.")
('Van', "I was tryin' to keep my voice down so only you could<br/>hear me. If people were gonna notice you, it wouldn't<br/>have been 'cause of me.")
('Judith', 'W-Well, you still...')
('Van', "Anyway, you didn't answer my question. Why all the<br/>repeat viewings of your own movies? You that much<br/>of a narcissist?")
('Judith', "Who said I was a narcissist?! It's nothing like that!")
('Van', 'Look, I get it. We all go through that phase at some<br/>point in our lives.')
('Van', "It's perfectly normal for you to get a kick outta how<br/>hot you look in the mirror when you're going<br/>through puberty.")
('Van', 'Thought you were a little old for that, though.')
('Judith', "I'm telling you, you've got it all wrong! And what do<br/>you mean, 'old'? I'm younger than you!")
('Van', "I'll take your word for it, then. So what is it<br/>you're doing? Some kinda weird hobby?")
('Judith', "It's NOT a hobby!")
('Judith', "...I didn't come here to watch the movie. I came here<br/>to watch the audience.")
('Van', 'The audience?')
('Van', "Like what, to bask in their adoration as they watch<br/>you strut your stuff? Well, damn, girl. You're an even<br/>bigger narcissist than I thought.")
('Van', 'Gotta hand it to you, it takes a special kind of person<br/>to go to that much trouble to have their ego<br/>massaged. Props.')
('Judith', "Now you're just trying to piss me off, aren't you?!")
('Van', "You figured it out already? And here I was hopin' I'd<br/>get a couple more selge out of that...")
('Judith', 'You could at least PRETEND to be a little sorry!')
('Judith', 'Ugh... I swear, talking to you is bad for my<br/>mental health.')
('Van', "Okay, real talk. I'm guessin' you're here to gauge the<br/>audience's reaction to your work?")
('Judith', 'Yeah, more or less.')
('Judith', "Although I'm mostly looking for some specific things.")
('Judith', 'When I come on the screen, I pay attention to how<br/>the people around me are reacting.')
('Judith', "Where they laugh, where they cry, where they're<br/>let down. Stuff like that.")
('Judith', 'It gives me a good barometer of how well my acting is<br/>landing with people, so I can see where I maybe need<br/>to improve going forward.')
('Van', "You don't say? I didn't realize you did so much<br/>homework between shoots.")
('Judith', "I don't do it just to study their reactions, either. I also<br/>do it to...put things into perspective for myself, I<br/>guess you'd put it.")
('Van', 'Not sure I follow.')
('Judith', "When I'm filming something, obviously I like to<br/>think that the final product's going to come out just<br/>like the director and I intended.")
('Judith', "But audiences don't always see what we see in the<br/>same way.")
('Judith', "They might hate something you felt confident about,<br/>or they'll love something you didn't even put all that<br/>much work into.")
('Judith', "Some people might chalk it up to just differences in<br/>tastes or perspective, but that feels like such a waste<br/>when there's so much you can learn.")
('Judith', "Unlike what you might think, we don't make movies<br/>just to satisfy ourselves. We want audiences to be<br/>moved—maybe even be inspired by them.")
('Judith', "You can't improve your craft as an actor unless you<br/>take the time to sit down and figure out where you<br/>and your audience don't see eye to eye.")
('Judith', "At least, that's what I sincerely feel.")
('Van', 'Huh. You put more thought into your work than<br/>I expected. I always figured you were just riding the<br/>wave of your success all the way to the bank.')
('Judith', "Aidios, you sound just like my mom and grammy!<br/>What on Zemuria makes you think I'm anything<br/>like that?!")
('Van', "I was tryin' to give you a compliment, I swear.<br/>Interesting to know your family gives you that same<br/>sort of grief, though.")
('Judith', "Err... Pretend you didn't hear that.")
('Van', "Also, I'm impressed you can discern people's faces so<br/>much inside a dark movie theater.")
('Van', 'Is that one of the perks from your side hustle? It gives<br/>you cat vision at night?')
('Judith', "No, it's not because of th—I mean, I have no idea<br/>what you're talking about!")
('Van', "(Who does this woman think she's fooling?)")
('Van', "Is this sort of field research somethin' you've always<br/>done since becoming an actress?")
('Judith', 'I used to do it a lot back in the day. But the last two<br/>or three years, not so much.')
('Judith', "These days, as soon as I wrap up one film, it's<br/>immediately on to the next shoot.")
('Judith', "Between that and my other 'occupation,' I hardly<br/>have time for it now.")
('Van', "But you had some free time for once and decided to<br/>do it for old time's sake?")
('Judith', 'Had it? More like I had to make it for myself.')
('Judith', 'I had to turn down every offer for shooting and<br/>interviews in order to make this happen.')
('Van', 'No kidding? That determined, huh?')
('Judith', "It's not just that I missed it and wanted to do it.<br/>The festival made me realize I need to start stepping<br/>up my game.")
('Van', 'Because you had the award for best actress taken from<br/>under your nose?')
('Judith', 'Pretty much...')
('Judith', 'Nina has such incredible talent for an actress her age.')
('Judith', "I knew she might catch up to me sooner or later, but I<br/>didn't remotely expect it to happen this soon.")
('Van', "I get how that might be a shock to you, but it's just<br/>one film festival. Do you really need to be so hung up<br/>on the results?")
('Van', "Her winning the award doesn't take away from the<br/>caliber of your own acting.")
('Van', "Golden Blood and Wolves' Requiem are both huge,<br/>incredibly entertaining films.")
('Van', "Most reviews had 'em neck and neck when it came to<br/>the quality of their acting and their sheer level<br/>of polish.")
('Judith', "I appreciate the pep talk, but I don't want to give<br/>myself excuses for what happened.")
('Judith', 'At the end of the day, I lost out. Those are the facts,<br/>plain and simple.')
('Judith', "If I don't always knock audiences and judges off their<br/>feet with my acting, then I'm not doing the absolute<br/>best I can!")
('Van', "(Spoken like a true actress who's earned her spot as<br/>queen of the industry.)")
('Van', "(When I first got to see the real her, I thought I'd<br/>regret ever being a fan...but maybe I don't have<br/>anything to worry about after all.)")
('Judith', 'You got something else you want to say to me, hmm?')
('Judith', 'Anyway, not to get off topic, but how did you see<br/>through my disguise in the theater?')
('Judith', "I know it wasn't the most elaborate thing in the<br/>world, but I was pretty confident I wouldn't<br/>get caught.")
('Van', "I probably only noticed 'cause I heard a couple of guys<br/>talking about you right before I saw you.")
('Van', "If I hadn't, I doubt I'd have given you the time of day.")
('Judith', 'Really? What were they discussing?')
('Van', "Nothin' big. Just how things went for you at the<br/>film festival.")
('Van', "From the way they were talking, those awards—or<br/>lack of, I guess—don't seem to have done anything to<br/>diminish your fan base.")
('Van', 'I know I still count myself as part of it.')
('Judith', 'Oh, uh... Good to know.')
('Judith', "Well, don't you worry. Next time a film festival<br/>comes rolling around, I'll be standing at the top of<br/>that winners' podium where I belong.")
('Judith', "Until then, I'm going back to basics and honing my<br/>acting so it's that much better! You'll see!")
('Van', "Heh. Good luck with that. I'll be watching.")
('System', 'Afterwards, Van escorted Judith to the subway on her<br/>way back home.')
('System', 'From there, he resumed his patrol around town.')
('System', 'Van decided to pay a visit to the café in the Tyrell<br/>District and took a break out on its terrace.')
('Van', '(*sigh* Sometimes, a pit stop at a café is just what the<br/>doctor ordered. I sure needed it after such a<br/>crazy afternoon.)')
(40301, "It looks like there aren't many customers here<br/>right now.")
('Elaine', "Perfect. Let's sit at that empty table over there.")
('Van', '(Hey, I recognize that voice.)')
('Elaine', '...!')
(40301, 'Are you okay? Is something wrong?')
('Elaine', "No, no, I'm fine.")
(40301, 'All right, then. Ready to start our interview?')
('Elaine', 'Yes. Ready when you are.')
('Van', "(Ahh. Guess she's talkin' to some magazine tonight.)")
(40301, 'First off, I wanted to discuss the whole incident that<br/>you resolved in Anchorville the other day.')
(40301, 'You did a fantastic job apprehending the culprits as<br/>negotiations were taking place. Your work was<br/>instrumental in defusing the whole crisis.')
('Elaine', "Thank you—but it wasn't just me who pulled it off.<br/>I was with a whole team of people. I'd argue they<br/>were the ones who really made it possible.")
('Elaine', 'Being promoted to A-rank has really driven that<br/>point home to me.')
('Elaine', 'When we all come together and support one another,<br/>we can achieve far more than we could by ourselves.<br/>That was true in Anchorville as well.')
(40301, "Interesting! Clearly you're a woman who values the<br/>fundamentals in life and work.")
(40301, 'Now about your family—obviously, they run one of<br/>the biggest sweets manufacturers in Zemuria...')
(40301, "Well, that's all the questions I have for you.<br/>Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with<br/>me tonight.")
(40301, 'Our readers are going to love learning about all the<br/>fascinating things you get up to in your spare time.')
('Elaine', "It was my pleasure. I don't think I had anything all<br/>that insightful to offer, but if your readers will enjoy<br/>it, I'm happy to talk.")
(40301, 'Also, I have to say! You look absolutely radiant<br/>as always.')
(40301, "I know I've asked you before, but would you be<br/>willing to publish a photobook with our company?<br/>I think you should really consider it.")
('Elaine', "I'm really sorry...but as a rule, I always turn down<br/>offers like that. It's nothing personal.")
(40301, "That's a shame. I'm sure it would be a smash hit.<br/>The people can't get enough of you, you know.")
(40301, "Anyway, I'll let you go now. I've taken up enough of<br/>your time as it is.")
(40301, 'Enjoy the rest of your evening.')
('Elaine', '*sigh*...')
(40302, "Here's your vanilla cocoa!")
('Elaine', "Huh? I didn't order anything like that.")
(40302, "You didn't, but the customer sitting at the next<br/>table did. He asked me to give you one.")
('Elaine', "What's the big idea behind this?")
('Van', "There's no big idea. I just know you like vanilla cocoa,<br/>that's all.")
('Elaine', 'How old do you think I am?')
('Van', "Hey, if you don't want it, I'll gladly take it. Your call.")
('Elaine', "I didn't say I wouldn't have it.")
('Elaine', "You're not wrong. I do still enjoy this—it's a<br/>soothing flavor.")
('Elaine', "René always makes fun of me for it and says I'm still a<br/>little kid whenever we go out for drinks.")
('Van', "I'd be more shocked if he didn't.")
('Van', "Still, you're pretty much the poster girl for the guild<br/>these days, aren't you?")
('Van', "How many magazine interviews have you done<br/>this season? I've lost track.")
('Elaine', "It's no big deal. I knew that promoting the guild's<br/>mission was going to be part of the job when I<br/>accepted the promotion to A-rank.")
('Van', "For somethin' that's not such a big deal, you sure look<br/>exhausted carrying it out.")
('Elaine', '...')
('Van', "You might be able to play it cool around other people,<br/>but you can't fool me, Elaine.")
('Van', "As often as these sorts of things come up for you,<br/>deep down, I know they don't come easy.")
('Elaine', "...I'd appreciate it if you didn't speak like you<br/>understand where I'm coming from, Van.")
('Elaine', "Not after you've been gone for all these years.")
('Van', '...')
('Van', "You're right. That was out of line. I'm sorry.")
('Elaine', "You don't need to apologize. I wasn't asking you to.")
('Elaine', 'You should be more worried about yourself first<br/>and foremost.')
('Elaine', "You're always brushing up at the very edge of the law<br/>with your work. You're a smart and capable man, Van.<br/>You could be doing so many other—")
('Van', "I'm fine with my life as a spriggan. It's what suits me<br/>best—in a lot of ways.")
('Elaine', '...If you say so.')
('Elaine', "Those young women who work with you: their names<br/>are Agnès and Feri, right? At least keep those two out<br/>of harm's way, all right?")
('Van', "I will, I promise. If shit ever really hits the fan,<br/>I'll be the one who sticks his neck out and takes<br/>care of it one way or the other.")
('Elaine', 'Talk like that is another thing I wish you would<br/>knock off.')
('Elaine', "Well, I'm going to take off now.")
('Elaine', 'Thanks for the drink. I feel a lot better after that.<br/>Much more refreshed.')
('Van', 'No problem. Have a good night.')
('Van', "(Guess it's gonna take a lot more than that to mend<br/>things with her. Big surprise there.)")
('Van', "(Oh, well. If it helped her relax and feel better after<br/>that interview, that's what counts. Money well spent.)")
('Van', "Man, I got so busy talkin', I let it get cold. Money not<br/>so well spent there.")
('System', 'After taking a sip of his cooled coffee, Van got back<br/>to patrolling Edith.')
('System', "Van's group decided to take a short break.")
('System', 'Everyone split up so they could spend their free time<br/>as they pleased.')
('Van', "Hey there. Not used to seein' you here.")
('Elaine', "Oh. It's you, Van.")
('Elaine', "I'm not here to watch any movies. I was just passing<br/>through after receiving a nearby assignment.")
('Van', "That explains it. For a sec, I thought you were slackin'<br/>off and sneaking in a showing.")
('Elaine', "Just because you have that sort of time on your hands<br/>doesn't mean we all do. I happen to be as busy<br/>as ever.")
('Van', "Hey, I'm plenty busy, too, y'know. I'm just taking a<br/>short break.")
('Van', "Anyway, which movie caught your attention?<br/>Curious what Beauty's Blade is into these—")
('Elaine', "Sorry, I can't talk any more. I have to get back<br/>to work.")
('Van', 'H-Hey! I was just asking!')
('System', 'The Mishy everyone loves is hitting the big screen!')
('System', 'Mishy in Boots, coming to theaters this November!')
('Van', 'Well, that explains it.')
('Van', "Can't say I'm shocked she's a little bashful about it.<br/>Nothin' wrong with liking Mishy, though.")
('Van', "Hmm... I've got an idea.")
('System', "Van's group decided to take a short break.")
('System', 'Everyone split up so they could spend their free time<br/>as they pleased.')
('Van', "So what's the big deal, René? Why'd you drag me<br/>all the way out here on such short notice?")
('Kincaid', "You know I'd prefer if you didn't call me that.")
('Kincaid', 'All these years later, and I still have to remind you<br/>first thing when we sit down to talk. You never<br/>change, do you, Van?')
('Van', "I only call you that 'cause it's still your name, pal.<br/>Change your name and I'll change what I call you.<br/>Simple as that.")
('Kincaid', "Heh. I take that back. You HAVE changed.<br/>You're now sassier than before.")
('Kincaid', "Now, then, I realized that ever since we exchanged<br/>contact info, we haven't once gotten together in<br/>private like this.")
('Kincaid', 'So, since I had some time to relax away from work<br/>today, I decided to call you over here—and now, here<br/>we are.')
('Van', "So you don't have any real business with me, is what<br/>you're saying? You're a real roundabout guy,<br/>y'know that?")
('Van', "Most guys when they just wanna shoot the shit<br/>together do it over a couple pints at the local bar<br/>or somethin'.")
('Kincaid', "Trust me, I have plenty of reasons to drink.<br/>We'll have to make time to do that sometime later.")
('Kincaid', 'Unlike your freewheeling self as a spriggan, those of<br/>us in the government always have our hands full<br/>with work.')
('Kincaid', "And I never said I didn't have business with you, Van.")
('Kincaid', "Don't you think it's my job as something of the older<br/>brother to wonder how you're doing and want to<br/>check in?")
('Van', "Oh... So that's what all this is about, huh?")
('Van', "Well, I'm just about the same as ever. Barely keepin'<br/>the business afloat as best I can. You know how<br/>it goes.")
('Kincaid', "You brought in more help, though, didn't you?<br/>I heard he's attached to Heiyue as well.")
('Kincaid', "With one glaring exception, I have to say, you're<br/>building up quite the seedy roster of lackeys<br/>over there.")
('Van', "Could you not dig these things up like you're a<br/>world-class shovel before I've even said a word<br/>about them?!")
('Van', "But just so we're clear, they foisted themselves onto<br/>me without asking. They're not there 'cause I asked<br/>'em to be.")
('Van', "If I had it my way, I'd still be flyin' solo and<br/>everything would be perfect.")
('Kincaid', 'You say that, but you have a noticeable spring in your<br/>step compared to before.')
('Kincaid', "It's fine to say you like them, Van. You're not a<br/>child anymore. No need to be bashful.")
('Van', 'Shut up!')
('Van', "*sigh* It's always the same with you. You and<br/>Elaine both...")
('Kincaid', 'And you, I should say.')
('Kincaid', 'If nothing else, I imagine your new helpers will be<br/>good for you in the long run.')
('Kincaid', "My hope is they'll keep you from being tempted to<br/>repeat what you pulled before. Certainly Elaine and I<br/>would both appreciate it.")
('Van', '...')
('Van', "Aren't you going to pick that up? It's probably a work<br/>call, isn't it?")
('Kincaid', "Don't worry about it. This is more important.")
('Kincaid', "Now, you're not in a rush, right? Why don't you and<br/>I...stay here for a while?")
('Kincaid', "At least until we're done drinking our coffee. You can<br/>even order some dessert, if you like.")
('Kincaid', "It'll be my treat. I'm feeling generous.")
('Van', "...Are you telling me we're—")
('Kincaid', "Keep talking like normal and don't look alarmed.<br/>This must look like a perfectly natural conversation.")
(40301, "Yeah. He's talking to that guy we have in our data.")
(40301, "...All right. I'll contact you again later.")
('Van', 'Looks like he took off.')
('Van', "Am I right in thinkin' it was you he was watching and<br/>not me?")
('Kincaid', 'Indeed. Your intuition is on point.')
('Kincaid', '...Correct. No problems here. Proceed with things as<br/>we originally planned.')
('Van', "Aidios. This is why you really called me out here,<br/>isn't it?")
('Kincaid', "No need to be so upset. It wasn't entirely about me—<br/>I genuinely wanted to hear how you were doing, too.")
('Van', "I didn't say I was upset.")
('Kincaid', "His name is Hubert. He's a relatively recent hire of<br/>the CID who joined us a year and a half ago.")
('Van', "That's all? He sure looks and acts like someone who's<br/>a lot less fresh than that.")
('Van', "What's a guy like him doing lookin' after one of the<br/>agency's own analysts?")
('Kincaid', "I said he was new to the CID, not the<br/>occupation itself. He used to work for the Imperial<br/>Army's Intelligence Division.")
('Van', "One of Erebonia's guys? Didn't their agency just get a<br/>big reshuffle a little while back?")
('Kincaid', "That's right. With the Ironbloods out of the picture<br/>and the war over, he said he saw the Empire as a<br/>lost cause.")
('Kincaid', "So he came over to our side and was nice enough to<br/>supply us with intelligence about the founding of<br/>Erebonia's new Intelligence Division.")
('Kincaid', 'He still maintains his citizenship over there as well.')
('Van', 'A double agent, then.')
('Kincaid', '...He is—insofar as most people within the CID<br/>are concerned.')
('Van', "Hold on! You're tellin' me he's...")
('Kincaid', "Yes. In all likelihood, he's a triple agent.")
('Kincaid', "He hasn't truly defected to our side. His real objective<br/>is to either obtain information on us or disrupt<br/>our operations.")
('Kincaid', 'All under the orders of Lechter Arundel at the<br/>new division.')
('Van', '...')
('Van', "I've heard that name before. Has a reputation for<br/>being a real cunning bastard.")
('Kincaid', "You're telling me. Even with the Ironbloods gone,<br/>he's a formidable figure who continues to sit at the<br/>heart of their intelligence operations.")
('Kincaid', "Nearly all spies we've sent into Erebonia since the war<br/>have either been terminated or sweet-talked into<br/>joining him instead.")
('Kincaid', "We've had quite a lot of egg on our face in recent<br/>times because of him.")
('Van', "All right, so back up a sec. If you already know that<br/>much about him, then that means you must be doing<br/>somethin' about it, right?")
('Kincaid', 'Correct. By letting him see me with you, we hope to<br/>cause a little disruption of our own within his<br/>intelligence network.')
('Kincaid', "With any luck, he'll be turned into a quadruple agent<br/>working to our benefit, whether he realizes it or not.")
('Kincaid', "Suffice it to say, it will be very interesting to see what<br/>Scarecrow's next move will be.")
('Van', "I'm not gonna lie. All this double-double crossing<br/>crap you got goin' on is making my head spin...")
('Van', "And hey! Keep me outta your stupid<br/>intelligence warfare! I don't want anything to do with<br/>that bullshit whatsoever!")
('Kincaid', 'Now, now. No need to get so worked up.')
('Kincaid', "I told you that you can order anything off the<br/>dessert menu. Go ahead—pick whatever you like.<br/>It'll make you feel better.")
('Van', "Don't you try to bribe me, you spectacled sadist!")
('System', "Van proceeded to order the most expensive desserts<br/>he could find out of spite. However, Kincaid wasn't<br/>even fazed, paying for it without a word of protest.")
('System', "Exasperated by his friend's eternally unflappable<br/>demeanor, Van returned to work with a sigh.")
('System', "Van's group decided to take a short break.")
('System', 'Everyone split up so they could spend their free time<br/>as they pleased.')
('Renne', "It's good to see you, spriggan. Thanks for coming by.")
('Van', "No problem. Didn't expect to get a request from you<br/>of all people, though. What gives? Why don't you<br/>want Agnès to know?")
('Renne', "Oh, I just don't want her to worry for no good reason,<br/>that's all.")
('Van', "Sure, 'that's all.' What's the real reason?")
('Renne', "Because it'll be more fun to take care of if it's just the<br/>two of us.")
('Van', 'Fun, huh? You always have an...interesting definition<br/>of that.')
('Renne', "Don't get me wrong. I really don't want to concern<br/>Agnès with this, either.")
('Van', "I'll take your word for it. You said you guys are having<br/>some kind of problem in the neighborhood<br/>around Aramis?")
('Renne', 'Right. In short, we seem to be having some people<br/>who are trying to spy on our students of late.')
('Van', "Not somethin' you really wanna hear. Have you<br/>talked to the police or the guild about it?")
('Renne', 'No. Not yet.')
('Renne', "My source for this information isn't the kind I'd<br/>rather share with the police in particular. I'm sure<br/>you understand.")
('Van', "Fair enough. I won't stick my nose where it isn't<br/>wanted either, then. If we're talkin' about kids being<br/>spied on here...")
('Van', "...then conventional wisdom would suggest these<br/>people are scoping 'em out to kidnap them later.")
('Van', "Wouldn't be all that surprising considering how many<br/>kids there come from money.")
('Van', "Even so, with the sort of security that campus has got,<br/>they've got their work cut out for them.")
('Renne', 'They do, but the signs are there nevertheless.')
('Renne', "Plus these people don't have to strike on campus to<br/>cause trouble. Once the students leave campus,<br/>they're out of our security guards' orbit.")
('Van', "Right. Which is exactly what they'll be doing sooner<br/>rather than later. I see where this is going.")
('Renne', 'Exactly. Our big trip coming up puts me in a<br/>real bind.')
('Renne', "With the students operating on their own outside of<br/>campus, it'll be impossible for me to be in all places at<br/>once to keep an eye on things.")
('Renne', "Which is why I'd prefer if we can get all of this<br/>straightened out before we leave so I can put this<br/>idiot's machinations to bed once and for all.")
('Van', "...Sounds like there's more to this than meets the eye,<br/>but even without me knowing, I understand where<br/>you're comin' from.")
('Van', "Not somethin' we should put on the back burner,<br/>that's for sure.")
('Renne', "So does that mean you'll help me?")
('Van', "I've come this far, so might as well. Plus I'm curious<br/>what would make it so 'fun,' as you put it.")
('Van', "Guessin' you have some sort of reason you want me to<br/>help you specifically?")
('Renne', 'I do. I have a good hunch as to who might be<br/>behind this.')
('Renne', "He's the kind of person who'd be best to handle with<br/>your help.")
('Renne', "Of course, I want to make it worth your time, too, so<br/>I've arranged a special award for you in addition to<br/>your usual commission.")
('Renne', "There's a famous ice cream maker in Liberl who put<br/>out a brand new gelato flavor.")
('Renne', 'A flavor that I just so happened to have flown to me<br/>all the way from Grancel. You interested?')
('Van', "'Interested'?! That flavor's the hottest topic right now<br/>in the sweets magazine I read!")
('Van', 'I thought they had orders for that stuff backed up all<br/>the way to next year!')
('Renne', "What can I say? If I want your services, I've got to<br/>make sure I come prepared. It's the least I could do.")
('Van', 'Heh. You know me too well, Kitty.')
('Van', "If that's on the line, you can be damn sure I'll earn<br/>my keep! Let's get to work!")
('Nina', 'Huh? Just where did my notes go? Oh, no...')
('Van', 'Hey. Looking for this?')
('Nina', "Oh, yes! Thank you so much! You don't know how<br/>much I appreciate it.")
('Nina', "These notes are so important to me. I would've hated<br/>to lose them.")
('Van', "You were writing a ton of stuff down while that<br/>movie was playing. Were you jottin' down the plot for<br/>future reference?")
('Nina', 'Err, not so much the plot as how the<br/>actors performed. Watching them gave me a lot of<br/>really good food for thought.')
('Nina', 'Especially when it came to Shawn, the main character.')
('Nina', 'The way he looked so powerless as he argued with his<br/>supervisor, you could see so many emotions running<br/>through him at once. It was incredible!')
('Van', 'Absolutely. Master class in acting right there.')
('Van', "You've got pretty sophisticated taste for a<br/>high schooler. That movie's pretty subdued, all<br/>things considered.")
('Van', 'You in the drama club at Aramis or something?')
('Nina', 'Uh, yes. Something like that.')
('Nina', "I'm actually studying to try and become an actress<br/>after I graduate.")
('Van', "Nice! Good for you. I'm sure it ain't easy, but with<br/>passion like that, you just might make it.")
('Nina', 'Aww, thank you. I hope so! Anyway, I have to get<br/>going now. See you later!')
('Van', "(Wait a minute. I feel like I've seen her<br/>somewhere before...)")
('Van', "(No, it couldn't be...could it?)")
('System', 'Obtained brochure for This Side of Heaven.')
('System', 'Van decided to stop by Esprit Cinema to check the<br/>showtime for the movies currently playing there.')
('System', "In particular, he was interested in Golden Blood<br/>Director's Cut, as well as a handful of other<br/>new releases.")
('System', 'While there, he also bought some caramel popcorn as<br/>a scrumptious reward for himself before leaving.')
('Van', "Heard they added some scenes to that director's cut<br/>that turned it into an age-restricted film.")
('Van', "Should be pretty fun seeing if they're worth<br/>the hype.")
('Detective Nate', 'You again!')
('Detective Nate', "Just what are you planning this time? How come<br/>you're prowling the street so nonchalantly, huh?!")
('Van', "C'mon, now. Since when did it become illegal to go<br/>out for a walk?")
('Van', "I appreciate you working late, Detective, but can't you<br/>leave a law-abiding citizen like me alone? Ain't good<br/>to harass without probable cause.")
('Detective Nate', 'Law-abiding? YOU?! You have GOT to be—')
('Inspector Daswani', "You've always got a comeback just ready to go, don't<br/>you, spriggan?")
('Inspector Daswani', "As for you, Nate, stay out of this guy's way. Don't go<br/>stirring things up without good reason. Understand?")
('Detective Nate', 'Yes, sir...')
('Inspector Daswani', 'Make no mistake, Arkride. The police are<br/>watching you. Remember that.')
('Inspector Daswani', "The next time something happens, you'll be—")
(40302, 'EEEEEEK!')
(40301, 'Look out! A robber!')
(40301, 'Out of the way, losers!')
('Inspector Daswani', 'Gah!')
('Detective Nate', 'A robber? Here?!')
('Van', 'Well, good thing you guys are out on patrol right<br/>now, huh? Better hurry up and catch him.')
('Detective Nate', "Excuse me? Are you just going to stand there and<br/>do nothing? You're strong! You should be helping us!")
('Van', "Sorry, but I don't work for free. 'Sides, I'm not exactly<br/>in the business of catching bad guys. That's your<br/>job, cop.")
('Van', "Now what're you waiting for? Time's a-wastin'.")
('Detective Nate', "You've got some nerve, spriggan! I have half a mind<br/>to—")
('Inspector Daswani', "Forget him! Let's go!")
(40302, 'Oww...')
('Van', "Are you all right, ma'am?")
(40302, 'Oh, thank you. Thank you!')
('Van', "I'm guessin' it was that robber who pushed you<br/>over, yeah?")
('Van', 'Think you can walk?')
(40302, 'Y-Yes, I think so. My foot hurts a little, but I can<br/>do it...')
(40302, "You're so kind. I really appreciate it... Oww!")
('Van', "You should rest on that bench over there. I'll go ring<br/>up the cops so they can take care of you.")
('Van', '(If I had to guess, the robber took that winding<br/>underground escape route to get away.)')
('Van', "(Guys like him can't resist going through there.)")
('Van', '(There are multiple exits out of that place and ways to<br/>get to them. At this time of day, the best one for a<br/>criminal to use would be...)')
('Jack', "Huh? What're you doing here?")
('Halle', "Why do you think I'm here? It's because I'm the one<br/>who bought the coin.")
('Van', 'I figured it was possible I might run into you, and<br/>now here you are, I guess.')
('Halle', 'Yep, here I am. Good to see you, Van.')
('Halle', 'I was originally planning on having Mau officiate<br/>our little game.')
('Halle', "Buuut if you're here, I'd be more than happy to have<br/>you do it, if you don't mind.")
('Van', "Sure, I can do that. Bit of a roundabout way to<br/>challenge someone to a game, though, don't<br/>you think?")
('Halle', "Yeah, but unless I go to that much trouble, Jack won't<br/>take it as seriously as he should.")
('Halle', "So just to reiterate, Jack, I want to play a game of<br/>poker with you. Winner keeps King's coin.")
('Halle', 'Sound good to you?')
('Jack', "I'm game. You're on.")
('Jack', 'You think you have any chance of winning<br/>against me?')
('Halle', 'Do you really need to ask, Jack?')
('Jack', "You're right, my bad. That was dumb.")
('Halle', 'Haha.')
('Halle', "All right—now with that settled, I'll have you hold on<br/>to the coin, Van.")
('Halle', "Every round, you'll flip that bad boy to determine<br/>who goes first.")
('Halle', "If it's heads, I go first. Tails, Jack goes first.")
('Van', "I feel like I'm being given a big responsibility, runnin'<br/>this match. I'll do my best to make you guys proud.")
('Jack', "I'm sure you'll do just fine, Van. We appreciate<br/>having you. ...Well, may the best hand win. Let's<br/>get down to business.")
('System', "Jack and Halle's game got underway as Van watched<br/>the proceedings unfold.")
('System', 'After the pair exchanged 100,000 mira for ten poker<br/>chips, they began to trade blows with each hand<br/>of cards.')
('System', 'Once the match fully heated up, all of the remaining<br/>chips were put on the line in a dramatic showdown.')
('Jack', "You've really stepped up your game, Halle.<br/>I'm impressed.")
('Jack', "Truth be told, I didn't expect you to even last<br/>this long.")
('Halle', "Save it for when you win, Jack. This game ain't over<br/>until it's over.")
('Jack', 'Heh. You got that right.')
('Van', "Sheesh, you two are freakin' nuts. Not too many in<br/>Zemuria who can read each other's hands and bluff<br/>the way you can.")
('Van', "Looks like this next hand's gonna be our grand finale.")
('Jack', 'Sure seems like it. Keep up the good work, Van.')
('Halle', "It doesn't matter who goes first. Either way, your<br/>fate's already set!")
('Van', 'Well, here goes nothing.')
('Van', '(Moment of truth. Which hand should I catch the<br/>coin with?)')
('Van', "It's tails. Your move, Jack.")
('Jack', "Damn. I've gotta go first, huh?")
('Jack', "If that's the way it's going to be...I'll exchange<br/>two cards.")
('Halle', "Aww, were you thinking of trying 'that' on me?")
('Halle', "No wonder you're disappointed. It's definitely better<br/>to go second in that case.")
('Van', "Halle's got four kings.")
('Van', "What've you got, Jack?")
('Jack', "I get it now. You must've mastered King's technique<br/>to play like that.")
('Van', 'Four-of-a-kind for Jack.')
('Van', "What's going on? Did Halle set this all up?")
('Jack', "Sure did. King's whole specialty back in the day was<br/>taking control of the cards—including his opponent's<br/>own hand.")
('Jack', 'You played well, Halle.')
('Van', "It's heads. Your move, Halle.")
('Jack', "Guess I'm after her.")
('Halle', "Oh? Thinking of pulling 'that' on me, are you?")
('Halle', "Don't count your chickens before they hatch is all I've<br/>got to say. ...I'll exchange two cards.")
('Jack', "Let's see you walk the walk, then.")
('Jack', "I'll also exchange two cards. And with that, I'll open.")
('Jack', "Wait... You've gotta be shitting me.")
('Jack', "I'm supposed to be the one with four kings here.")
('Halle', 'Haha. What are you talking about?')
('Halle', "That's my hand, silly.")
('Van', "...So it is. That's another four-of-a-kind.")
('Van', "You tellin' me Halle set all this up? Even your<br/>own hand?")
('Jack', "Sure did. King's whole specialty back in the day was<br/>taking control of the cards, including his opponent's<br/>own hand.")
('Jack', "You had to have mastered King's technique in order<br/>to play like that.")
('Jack', "I'm genuinely impressed.")
('Halle', "Ain't nothing to it! W-Wait.")
('Halle', "There's still one card you haven't opened.")
('Halle', 'What could you possibly still have left? The game<br/>should be over...')
('Jack', "Not if I've got a wild card in my hand.")
('Jack', "And that's exactly what I have. A five-of-a-kind<br/>with jacks. Read 'em and weep.")
('Jack', 'Sorry, Halle. I win.')
('Halle', 'What the...?')
('Van', "I'm not sure I follow you guys. Did you somehow use<br/>Halle's own move against her?")
('Jack', 'More or less, yeah.')
('Halle', 'No way... How...? How is that possible...?')
('Halle', '...')
('Halle', "*sigh* I can wonder all I like. But at the end of the<br/>day, they call you 'Victory Jack' for a reason.")
('Halle', "I lost, and that's all there is to it.")
('Halle', 'So, time for me to pay the piper, I suppose.')
('Halle', "The coin's all yours, Jack.")
('Van', 'Here you are, Jack. Good game.')
('Jack', 'Thanks. That was a fun one, to say the least.')
('Jack', "There's one more thing we need to settle before we<br/>head on out.")
('Jack', "Halle, I'm giving you the coin. You're the one who<br/>should hold on to it.")
('Halle', 'H-Huh? Jack, what are you doing?')
('Halle', "We agreed that whoever won gets to keep the coin.<br/>You earned it. You shouldn't give it back to me!")
('Halle', "In fact, I WANT you to have it! There's nobody else<br/>I'd rather see it with than you. Seriously, take it.<br/>It's okay.")
('Van', "(Oh, I get it now. That whole match was just a setup<br/>for her to give the coin to him all along, wasn't it?)")
('Jack', "Sorry, Halle, but I can't let you have your way on<br/>this one.")
('Jack', "If that coin was mine, then it'd be up to me to decide<br/>what to do with it.")
('Jack', "But if you're that determined to hoist the thing on me<br/>anyway, then there's only one thing you can do.")
('Halle', '...Play you again. Play you again and win.')
('Jack', "That's right. That's how these things work in<br/>our world.")
('Halle', "...Hmph. Fine. If that's how you're going to be,<br/>you're on!")
('Halle', "I'll keep improving my skills and then one of these<br/>days, I'll beat you when you're playing your<br/>absolute hardest.")
('Halle', "Until then, you'd better not lose to anybody else but<br/>me or your ass is grass! Deal?")
('Jack', 'Haha. Deal.')
('Van', "(Man, you won't find another pair of gamblers like<br/>these anywhere else in Zemuria.)")
('Van', "(I'm glad I got to see this little exchange today.<br/>That was neat.)")
('System', 'With the promise made, Van proceeded to enjoy<br/>some yum cha with Jack and Halle at Caiyunge.')
('System', 'Afterwards, he reunited with the others and got back<br/>to work.')
('System', 'Thirty minutes prior...')
('Prince Sherid', "Calvard's film culture is truly impressive. Big studio or<br/>small, they all manage to release some rather fine<br/>pieces of cinema.")
('Prince Sherid', 'That ordinary members of the public have places like<br/>this that they can visit to enjoy such works is<br/>also wonderful.')
('Prince Sherid', "We really must work to further their spread<br/>into Elsaim. Wouldn't you agree, Naje?")
('Naje', 'Yes. Our time at the film festival really heightened<br/>my appreciation for movies.')
('Prince Sherid', 'Well, then, now to decide our next destination.<br/>Any ideas?')
('Naje', "Shouldn't we call it an evening, Your Highness?")
('Naje', 'You have meetings with other Calvardian businesses<br/>scheduled for tomorrow and beyond, after all.')
('Prince Sherid', "...I suppose you're right. Very well. Let's return to<br/>our hotel.")
('Naje', "As you wish. I'll have them send the car to—")
('Naje', "What is it? ...What? There's been a collision along<br/>our route back?")
('Naje', "Get me the details. I need to know exactly what's<br/>going on. We can't risk exposing His Highness to any<br/>potential danger, no matter how slight.")
('Naje', 'A Team, go to the scene and report what you find.<br/>B Team, search for any viable substitute routes we<br/>can take if necessary.')
('System', "Van's group decided to take a short break.")
('System', 'Everyone split up so they could spend their free time<br/>as they pleased.')
('Shizuna', "Aaah, it's so fun being in the big city! There are so<br/>many strange and unusual things to see.")
('Shizuna', "Like that place over there! I wonder what it's<br/>supposed to be. Maybe I'll have a look-see just<br/>for fun.")
('Van', "(Ugh. What does she think she's doing?)")
('Van', "(She's drawing a ton of attention to herself, walking<br/>around lookin' like that.)")
('Van', '(I guess everything I heard was true after all.<br/>Better make myself scarce before I get caught up in<br/>anything—)')
('Shizuna', 'Van! Van, is that you over there? What<br/>a COINCIDENCE!')
('Van', 'Damn it. Guess I better resign myself to my fate.')
('Shizuna', "Heeey. You weren't trying to run away from me just<br/>now, were you?")
('Shizuna', "That really hurts! Just because I'm a hardened warrior<br/>doesn't mean I'm made of stone, you know.")
('Van', "I'm not worried about your feelings as much as my<br/>own rep if people see me hanging out with someone<br/>who can't dress like a normal person.")
('Shizuna', 'What? Do I really look that weird? I like to think I<br/>stay on top of the latest trends in my own way.')
('Van', "You're better than your ninja pals, I'll give you<br/>that much. But you still stick out like a sore thumb in<br/>these parts.")
('Shizuna', "Well, so what if I do? You've got to learn not to sweat<br/>the small stuff so much, Van.")
('Van', "I wouldn't be sweatin' it if it was SMALL.<br/>That's what I'm telling you!")
('Shizuna', 'Well, either way, I found you at the perfect time.')
('Shizuna', "I don't know what you're up to right now, but could<br/>you come with me for a little bit? I could use your<br/>help with something.")
('Van', "*sigh*... Whatever you have in mind, you better not<br/>be tryin' to stir anything up. I don't want any part<br/>of that.")
('Shizuna', "Alas, I'm not. Although that's a good idea, too!")
('Van', "I wasn't TRYING to suggest anything.")
('Shizuna', "Anyway, I'm looking to track down a skilled smithy<br/>who can keep things hush-hush.")
('Shizuna', "But as you can imagine, I hardly know anything about<br/>the city, so I haven't had much luck finding anyone<br/>so far.")
('Shizuna', 'Do you know anybody you could maybe recommend<br/>to me?')
('Van', "Sure, I got someone in mind. Why do you need<br/>someone like that? Gotta retemper your sword<br/>or somethin'?")
('Shizuna', 'Oh, no. The blade itself is doing just fine.')
('Shizuna', "It's the scabbard that needs some patching up<br/>after the heavy beating it took in Oración.")
('Van', "It does, huh? That's unfortunate.")
('Van', "(I've heard of swordsmen using their scabbards as<br/>weapons before, but I didn't realize that's what she<br/>did back there.)")
('Shizuna', "I'll say! So, what do you say? Think you can hook a<br/>girl up? ❤")
('Van', "...All right. But if I'm gonna help you, you have to<br/>promise not to cause any chaos once we're done.<br/>Got it?")
('Agnès', 'Phew. That scene where Zoe gets cornered by Rick<br/>always gets my heart racing every time I see it.')
('Agnès', 'Deep down, I have to wonder if she really felt hurt by<br/>his whole betrayal.')
('Agnès', "The first time I saw it, I didn't really pick up on<br/>anything like that. But this time around, I felt like<br/>she was.")
('Van', "That's one of the best parts of watching movies.<br/>When you go back and rewatch them, you notice<br/>little things like that you didn't before.")
('Agnès', 'I totally get that now. It made it even more fun<br/>to watch. Thanks for bringing me, Van.')
('Feri', 'I LOVE Golden Blood! It never gets old!')
('Feri', "I wish I could have Zoe's combat suit! It's so—what's<br/>the word?—mature, but so practical at the same time!")
('Van', "Bit young to be wantin' it for one of those reasons,<br/>don't you think?")
('Van', "But hey, if you're interested in it so much, it wouldn't<br/>surprise me if they put the real suit that was used in<br/>the film out on display sometime.")
('Feri', "Really? That'd be awesome! You've gotta take me if<br/>they do!")
('Feri', "You think they'd let me try it on if I asked?")
('Van', "I wouldn't get your hopes up about that.")
('Aaron', 'Well, that lived up to the hype. Always enjoy me a<br/>good spectacle.')
('Aaron', "Only thing that would've made it better is if that<br/>chick's tits spilled out of her suit even more.<br/>You've gotta agree, that'd make it perfect.")
('Van', "*sigh* Can't you keep it in your pants for just<br/>one day?")
('Aaron', "Shut up, you old prude. You can't give me crap after<br/>getting to worship at that woman's altar all up close<br/>and personal.")
('Aaron', 'How was the view? Pretty hot I bet, huh?')
('Van', "Like I'm telling you, you brat! Now quit makin' a<br/>scene in public with your horny ass!")
('Aaron', "Suit yourself. I'll just catch that director's cut and find<br/>out for myself if that's what it takes.")
('Risette', "Ms. Lanster's athleticism was as impeccable as always.")
('Risette', 'Her daily fitness routine has clearly paid dividends.<br/>The amount of time and effort she puts into it must<br/>be extraordinary.')
('Van', "To put it lightly. That woman is no slouch. You can't<br/>pull off those kinds of stunts without being puttin' in<br/>the work.")
('Risette', "Indeed. Even if she's immensely talented in her...<br/>extracurricular activities, that alone doesn't explain it.")
('Risette', 'No matter how much strength one might have, it<br/>takes mastering such fundamentals in order to both<br/>draw it and then utilize it in practice.')
('Van', "Yeah. There's clearly a lot that's gone on behind the<br/>scenes for her to achieve so much. Gotta give her<br/>props for it.")
('Quatre', "That was—what's the best way to describe it?—<br/>very bombastic, to say the least.")
('Quatre', "I'd certainly heard as much going into it, but I still<br/>wasn't fully prepared for it.")
('Van', 'Uhh, is that a good thing? Were you still able to<br/>enjoy it?')
('Quatre', "Oh, yeah! Absolutely! In fact, I'd love to see it again.")
('Quatre', "Now that I've seen it once, I'd love to sit down and<br/>analyze the scenes and the actors' expressions in it.")
('Van', "Damn. That into it, huh? Well, lemme know when<br/>you decide to go. I'll tag along.")
('Quatre', 'Oh... Okay. If you say so.')
('Quatre', "(I don't know how to tell him it'd be a little awkward<br/>watching it together with him like that...)")
('Judith', "It's hard to watch it without wanting to pick it<br/>apart now.")
('Judith', "We could've fit more action into it if we tried. And to<br/>be honest, I don't think I always had the most<br/>flattering angles, either.")
('Van', "You really think so? I don't think your average viewer<br/>is bound to see anything wrong with any of that.")
('Van', "Your body looks like it was born for that skintight suit<br/>Zoe's got.")
('Judith', "Maybe, but it's my job to stay fit. What can I say?<br/>...Sounds like somebody sure was paying close<br/>attention, though.")
('Judith', "All I'm saying is, when I watch that movie now, I can<br/>see why I lost that award for best actress to Nina.<br/>That's all.")
('Judith', "Something I won't let happen again, no matter what<br/>it takes.")
('Bergard', 'Hahaha! Now that was quite the thriller.')
('Bergard', "I like that Zoe woman. She shows that even the<br/>hardiest man around can't hold a candle to a sharp,<br/>tough woman.")
('Van', "Yeah. Director Salvatore Gotti's got a talent for<br/>drawin' out the charm and appeal of the actresses that<br/>he works with, which he sure did there.")
('Bergard', 'Does he, now? It makes me curious to see his<br/>other films.')
('Bergard', "I'll hope that they put out some of his old work back<br/>into theaters so I can catch them.")
('Van', "Sounds like he's got a brand new fan in you, Master.")
('System', 'Obtained brochure for Golden Blood.')
('System', 'Having finished their break, Van and his crew<br/>resumed their work.')
('Director Gotti', 'Hey! Is that who I think it is?')
('Fie', "Oh, it's Edith's most famous spriggan.")
('Albert', 'What the—? Why are you here?!')
('Director Gotti', "Gahaha! Van, my man! It has been a WHILE!<br/>How've you been, huh?")
('Van', "Hey, Gotti. Didn't think I'd bump into you of all<br/>people here.")
('Director Gotti', 'Yeah, well, I came over here to sober up from that<br/>afterparty, only to find they were playing my<br/>damn movie.')
('Director Gotti', "Ended up watching it one last time. Nothing like<br/>being reminded of the Lionne d'Or that got away to<br/>get me back to my senses, that's for sure.")
('Van', "I thought your eyes looked a little teared up for<br/>some reason. Guess it wasn't my imagination.")
('Van', "If you've put it behind you, though, does that mean<br/>you're already movin' on to your next movie?")
('Director Gotti', "Normally I'm not one to say—but you're a good<br/>friend, Van, so I'll make an exception and tell you<br/>I am. But that's all you're getting!")
('Director Gotti', "That said, you got a lot of potential in you. A LOT<br/>of potential. Say, why don't you come make your big<br/>acting debut on my next film?")
('Director Gotti', "You can be that hot as hell bad boy persona I saw you<br/>as back in Tharbad! Y'know, the one with the wild<br/>hair and the blue flames!")
('Director Gotti', "I bet—no, I KNOW that you'll be as popular as the<br/>actual stars themselves! Everybody'll love you!")
('Van', "Uhh, I don't know about—")
('Director Gotti', "You'll love the theme of it, too! The movie's about<br/>dark justice and getting revenge on fate—the kinda<br/>material that's right up your alley!")
('Van', "I appreciate the offer, I really do. But I think I'll pass.<br/>I'm a much better armchair critic than I am an actor.")
('Van', "And there's one of the Bracer Guild's rising stars.<br/>Didn't think I'd see you here.")
('Van', "Come here to watch something all by yourself?<br/>Must be pretty used to life in Calvard if you're takin'<br/>in stuff like this in your free time.")
('Fie', "I guess you could say that. I've been here about a<br/>month, so I'm feeling pretty comfortable now.")
('Fie', "I can't exactly go sightseeing around the country, so I<br/>figured I'd at least take in some of the film culture<br/>while I'm here.")
('Fie', "And I've got plenty of time to kill at night, unlike the<br/>daytime, so this is as good of a way to spend it as any.")
('Van', "Looks like you just caught that spicy director's cut.<br/>What made you go for that? Not that there's anything<br/>wrong with a woman seeing it.")
('Fie', "I mean, everyone's talked about it and Judith's in it.<br/>I figured, if I'm gonna see any version of it, might as<br/>well make it the real deal.")
('Fie', "They...don't leave a lot to the imagination.<br/>There were a lot of scenes where I didn't know where<br/>to keep my eyes.")
('Fie', "The spy bits were interesting, too. Bracers get up to<br/>espionage sometimes, but we don't use the kinds of<br/>tactics Judith does.")
('Van', "I figured. Sexy spycraft might only be a thing of the<br/>silver screen, but that's what makes those kinds of<br/>movies fun, if you ask me.")
('Albert', "*sigh* Of all the people I could've run into, why did it<br/>have to be you?")
('Albert', "Y-You're not going to tell Agnès about this...are you?")
('Van', "Nah. Your secret's safe with me, kid. I won't tell your<br/>president friend, either.")
('Van', "I just find it quaint that your idea of mischief<br/>amounts to some good old lying about your age while<br/>you're sneakin' outta the dorm.")
('Albert', "I wasn't talking about that! I mean, definitely don't<br/>tell the girls about those things, either!")
('Albert', "I'm more worried about them finding out what I<br/>watched, so...")
('Odette', 'There you are!')
('Odette', "I can't believe you, of all people, broke curfew!<br/>You had me so worried!")
('Albert', 'Odette?! Why are you here?!')
('Odette', "Renne figured if I'd find you anywhere, it'd probably<br/>be the movie theater, and what do you know? She<br/>was right.")
('Odette', "I'm glad you at least had Van with you. What'd you<br/>two watch here anyway?")
('Van', 'Funny you should ask that.')
('Van', "We ended up catching the same movie. It's supposed<br/>to be adults only, but he wanted to see it so badly, I<br/>decided to sneak him in with me.")
('Odette', "I see. What were they playing at this hour that Albert<br/>had to ask... Oooh! That's what you saw, was it?")
('Albert', "Wh-What? What's with that look?")
('Odette', "Nothing, nothing! You're just a teenage guy at the<br/>end of the day.")
('Albert', "I'm begging you. Whatever you do, please...don't<br/>tell Agnès.")
('System', "Van's conversation in the theater continued for a<br/>brief period.")
('System', 'Soon enough, however, the two sides parted ways in<br/>the lobby. From there, Van got on with the rest of<br/>his evening.')
('System', "Obtained brochure for Golden Blood Director's Cut.")
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', "Van! I didn't expect to run into you here.")
('Renne', 'Well, look who we have here.')
('Zin the Immovable', 'Hey, is that Van I see?')
('Van', 'I...could definitely say the same to you.')
('Van', "I didn't know you were into movies. Don't you think<br/>you stand out a little, lookin' like that, though?")
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', "Perhaps, but I didn't bring any of my business suits<br/>with me, so it was either come like this or don't come<br/>at all.")
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', 'Either way, that movie was well worth coming out<br/>to see.')
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', 'Especially since it gives me an opportunity to relax<br/>and catch up with one of my old students.')
('Van', "I don't know that there's anything relaxing you and I<br/>can really talk about, but maybe that's just me.")
('Van', 'You sure seemed busy earlier today. Did you come<br/>here to take a breather or something?')
('Van', "Not that I'm surprised a guy like you would go out of<br/>his way to see a movie like Wolves' Requiem.<br/>That's got your name written all over it.")
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', "And you'd be right. I appreciate how it reflects the<br/>times we live in while still making for an<br/>entertaining watch.")
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', 'It feels like it could happen in our own world, which<br/>gives it a certain depth.')
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', 'Everything you see in the movie has a light side and<br/>dark side to it—including its cast.')
('Van', 'You took the words right outta my mouth.')
('Van', "But enough about me. Shouldn't you think about<br/>seeing your kid sister for once?")
('Van', "I know for a fact she'd really appreciate it.")
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', "Concerning yourself with your staffs' personal lives,<br/>are you?")
('Security Chief Kasim (Regular Clothes)', 'You never could help yourself sticking your neck out<br/>for other people when you were younger. I see that<br/>remains the case.')
('Van', "This isn't about sticking my neck for other people.<br/>I just try to support my assistants so they can do their<br/>best work.")
('Van', "Should you really be wandering around town at<br/>this hour? Don't you have responsibilities back<br/>on campus?")
('Renne', "Oh, whatever are you talking about? I'm out on<br/>business—really.")
('Van', 'Yeah? This your idea of patrolling the city?')
('Van', "Eh, I guess there's no harm in it. They're only doing<br/>these reruns at night anyway.")
('Renne', "Well, after it took the Lionne d'Or in Tharbad, I<br/>couldn't afford NOT to see it, could I?")
('Renne', "I get why it made such a stir now. Nina Fenly's acting<br/>captured my attention the whole way through.")
('Renne', 'Especially while she lied in the arms of the man she<br/>loved, smiling till her final breath. You could feel the<br/>purity behind her feelings.')
('Renne', "She's a bewitching actress. It's hard to believe how<br/>much feminine charm she can muster despite us<br/>being nearly the same age.")
('Van', "It's even crazier to think about when you consider<br/>how subdued and wholesome she is in real life.")
('Van', "Makes you wonder what sort of façade she'll end up<br/>putting on next. I know I'll be first in line to see<br/>for myself.")
('Renne', "...'Façade.' That's a good choice of words.")
('Renne', 'Her ability to so convincingly put on such different<br/>personas must be why she has a reputation for being a<br/>gifted actress.')
('Renne', "But at the same time, it makes it hard to get a sense<br/>of who she really is when the cameras aren't rolling.")
('Renne', "It's almost like her identity is completely invisible<br/>looking at her from the outside.")
('Van', "(You're not the only one who thinks that.<br/>Nina herself has definitely worried about that exact<br/>thing before.)")
('Van', "I've met her a couple of times. At the very least, I<br/>don't get the vibe that she's a two-faced person or<br/>anything like that.")
('Van', "...But that's not what you're really saying here, is it?")
('Renne', "No. It's precisely because she's not any one person<br/>deep down that she can so capably mold herself<br/>however she likes.")
('Renne', 'In some ways, that makes her a pretty formidable<br/>person, whether she herself necessarily wants to be<br/>that way or not.')
('Renne', "Heehee. Geniuses are all such fascinating people<br/>to analyze. Wouldn't you agree?")
('Van', 'I think a ton of people would toss you in that exact<br/>same basket, you know.')
('Van', "Oh. Hey, Zin. Didn't realize you were here.")
('Zin the Immovable', "This time of day's the only stretch I get to myself.")
('Zin the Immovable', 'Fie filled me in on everything that happened<br/>around the film festival in Tharbad.')
('Zin the Immovable', "That's how I learned about the movie and it winning<br/>the first Lionne d'Or. When I saw they were doing<br/>reruns, I couldn't pass up seeing it.")
('Van', "Makes sense. It won that award for a damn good<br/>reason. It's probably the best movie released this<br/>year—a real masterpiece.")
('Van', 'Not to mention that Nina Fenly and her co-star both<br/>took the awards for best actress and actor on top<br/>of that.')
('Zin the Immovable', 'I can see why! It was great stuff. Lots of macho action<br/>and just as much romance that really pulls at<br/>your heartstrings. I loved it!')
('Zin the Immovable', "It's impressive how gritty it manages to depict the<br/>conflict between the police and gang while still being<br/>so entertaining to watch.")
('Zin the Immovable', "Makes me want to follow Leslie Lam's work and see<br/>what else he puts out.")
('Van', "Can't say I blame you. The press loves him just as<br/>much as movie nerds like me.")
('Van', "I have to imagine he's knee-deep in his next film<br/>by now. Lookin' forward to checking it out as a fan<br/>when it's out, myself.")
('System', "Van's conversation in the theater continued for a<br/>brief period.")
('System', 'Soon enough, however, the two sides parted ways in<br/>the lobby. From there, Van got on with the rest of<br/>his evening.')
('System', "Obtained brochure for Wolves' Requiem.")
('Kincaid', 'I thought you looked familiar. It seems I was more<br/>than a little right.')
('Elaine', 'Van? Were you just at that showing, too?')
('Dingo', "Heh. Of all the people I could've run into here, it had<br/>to be you.")
('Van', 'Not used to seeing you here, René.')
('Van', 'Does a CID wunderkind like you ever even have the<br/>time to spare to catch a movie?')
('Kincaid', "Hmph. In my mind, a person who doesn't know<br/>when to take a break and catch their breath isn't truly<br/>good at their job.")
('Kincaid', 'In any case, the reviews I read prior to its release<br/>made me want to see it, and now I have. I can see<br/>how it earned such praise.')
('Kincaid', "Nike Marceau does a bewitching job playing a<br/>woman with secrets to hide. Really, she's as<br/>immensely talented as one could be.")
('Van', "(I bet you DID like her acting, you<br/>government spook. I've heard my share of rumblings<br/>of what you're involved in.)")
('Van', "Honestly, I found the main plot of the movie to be a<br/>little tough to follow. Can't say it really grabbed me,<br/>at least watching it my first time.")
('Kincaid', "Really? You're such a connoisseur, I would have<br/>figured you enjoyed it.")
('Kincaid', 'You know, her performance really reminds me of<br/>someone I know.')
('Kincaid', 'Especially the way she chooses to live that world<br/>knowing full well how twisted it is. How despite it all,<br/>she embraces it, letting it box her in.')
('Kincaid', 'Does that sound familiar to you at all? Or is it just<br/>me, perhaps?')
('Van', "...Heh. I think it might just be you, pal. And 'sides,<br/>not everybody who chooses to be a recluse turns out<br/>to be crazy like her.")
('Van', "Hey, Elaine. That's wild, both of us catchin' the same<br/>movie at the exact same time. What were the odds of<br/>that, huh?")
('Elaine', "You're telling me. I couldn't pass this one up after<br/>hearing the reviews.")
('Elaine', 'They were all talking about what a unique movie it is<br/>and how good of a job Nike Marceau does in playing<br/>a woman going insane.')
('Van', "Damn. Sounds like you really did your homework<br/>goin' into it.")
('Van', "I'm surprised you'd watch something like that.<br/>I figured you were into more cutesy sh—")
('Elaine', "So what if I am? I can watch whatever I like, can't I?")
('Van', "I wasn't criticizing you, I swear. Just caught me off<br/>guard, is all.")
('Van', "I didn't think you could really handle the dark,<br/>heavier stuff.")
('Elaine', "...I couldn't when I was younger, yes. But these days,<br/>I can relate to someone like her.")
('Elaine', "I know what it's like to have pressure slowly piling<br/>onto you.")
('Elaine', "It's like a glass someone's always pouring into, little<br/>by little. It keeps getting closer to the top, but it never<br/>seems to stop.")
('Elaine', "I can't go back to being a nobody now. I'm Beauty's<br/>Blade and everything that comes with it—good<br/>and bad.")
('Van', "Elaine, I...I didn't realize you were...")
('Elaine', "Forget I said any of that. It's nothing you needed to<br/>hear, Van.")
('Elaine', "I'm going to head home now. Don't stay out too late,<br/>all right?")
('Van', "Can't say I'm all that surprised to see you.<br/>This definitely strikes me as your kind of flick.")
('Dingo', "You're not wrong. After all the reviews it got, I had to<br/>check it out for myself.")
('Dingo', "They all talked about how Nike Marceau's portrayal<br/>of insanity made it an unusual movie, which got<br/>my attention.")
('Dingo', "I've also heard stories of that woman from our friend<br/>in Langport from time to time, too. That gave me<br/>another reason to see it.")
('Van', "(Our friend in Langport, huh? He must mean...)<br/>Oh, yeah. I forgot those two go back a long way.<br/>That's interesting.")
('Van', "Truth be told, I found the direction to be a<br/>little obtuse. Definitely the kind of movie that's<br/>tailor-made for a particular kind of audience.")
('Dingo', "Fair enough. I'd say the core of the movie was the<br/>dialogue between the two Lilys that her warped mind<br/>gives rise to.")
('Dingo', 'Their back-and-forth projects a certain sense of<br/>dissonance that makes it difficult to pin down who<br/>Lily even really is as a person.')
('Dingo', 'The movie weaves truth and fiction together and is an<br/>exploration of what people become when they can no<br/>longer tell the two of them apart.')
('Dingo', "At least, that's what it's about in my opinion.")
('Van', "Damn. Look at you, gettin' all intellectual on me.<br/>Not good enough being Edith's most handsome guy<br/>in town, huh? Gotta be its smartest, too, now?")
('Dingo', "What can I say? It's a movie that made me think.")
('Dingo', 'We should get together for some drinks when both of<br/>us have some time to breathe. I want to talk shop<br/>about movies some more with you.')
('System', "Van's conversation in the theater continued for a<br/>brief period.")
('System', 'Soon enough, however, the two sides parted ways in<br/>the lobby. From there, Van got on with the rest of<br/>his evening.')
('System', 'Obtained brochure for Sober Curious.')
('Agnès', "Nina's acting in that movie was...incredible.")
('Agnès', 'She looked so dignified and certain about herself.<br/>You could see the determination in her eyes—like she<br/>really was prepared to die.')
('Van', 'It was impressive stuff, yeah. The scene where they all<br/>finally rise up was absolutely gripping.')
('Agnès', 'Now I really wish Nina was here so I could tell her<br/>just how amazing she was!')
('Agnès', "Every movie she's in feels so different from everything<br/>else she's done. I almost can't wait to see what she'll<br/>do next!")
('Van', "Well, I'm glad you enjoyed it. Sounds like I made the<br/>right call bringin' you along.")
('Agnès', '...Yes, you most certainly did. Thank you, Van.')
('Agnès', "It made me feel a little better. With everything that's<br/>going on, I definitely needed it.")
('Agnès', 'Absolutely! Thank you, Van!')
('Feri', 'Sheena Dirke was just as impressive in that movie as<br/>that statue in the memorial park. Actually, no, she<br/>was even MORE impressive!')
('Feri', "I couldn't help but get fired up seeing how close she<br/>and her friends were. Although, uh...")
('Feri', '...I kinda forgot what their names were.')
('Van', "That's okay. There were a lot of people to keep track<br/>of in that movie.")
('Van', "If you wanna learn more about them, you could<br/>always ask them to teach you during Sunday<br/>School, y'know.")
('Van', "Not that I mind telling you what I know, either.<br/>But it's probably one of those things you're better off<br/>learning properly.")
('Feri', "That's true! Yeah, I'll ask my teacher next time I<br/>see her! Good idea!")
('Feri', '...Anyway, thanks for doing this Van. I feel a little<br/>better after watching that.')
('Aaron', 'That Nina chick knocked it out of the park.')
('Aaron', 'She was a total natural playing a white aristocrat like<br/>Sheena Dirke. Big surprise there, though.')
('Van', 'I get the feeling it was a movie she herself wanted to<br/>make just as much as the people directing and<br/>producing it.')
('Van', 'Just goes to show that with enough determination<br/>and acting chops, anybody can make a role work.')
('Aaron', "Yeah. There's no getting around the whole<br/>racial conversation. All she could do is play it to the<br/>best of her ability and she sure as hell did.")
('Aaron', "Gives me something to think about as an actor.<br/>Maybe I'll try my hand playing a foxy western lady<br/>one of these days. Could be fun.")
('Van', "I guess I could see there being a certain amount of<br/>demand for somethin' like that, sure. Couldn't tell<br/>you why, but yeah.")
('Risette', 'That was a very excellent and entertaining retelling of<br/>Sheena Dirke and how she brought about<br/>the revolution.')
('Risette', "It's difficult to fathom that she was exactly my age<br/>when she thrust herself into such a historic battle.")
('Van', "I guess she would've been now that you mention<br/>it, huh?")
('Van', "She made a hell of a sacrifice in her lifetime so we<br/>could enjoy some amount of peace in our time today.<br/>We owe her more than we'll ever know.")
('Risette', "Indeed. They say it's the Goddess' will when in<br/>history we are all meant to be given life and fulfill<br/>our purpose.")
('Risette', "If that's the case, then I, for one, hope to make the<br/>most of the time I'm given and live my life to the<br/>fullest, just like Sheena Dirke did.")
('Van', '...Yeah. Agreed.')
('Quatre', "The professor is the one who taught me what I know<br/>about the Republic's history.")
('Quatre', "But even on its own, it's simply a good movie<br/>worth watching. A nice celebration of the savior of<br/>the country.")
('Van', 'Yeah. I could see how it would inspire someone to<br/>want to learn more.')
('Van', "Definitely have to assume some of it was embellished<br/>at least a little for entertainment's sake, though.")
('Quatre', 'Yeah. But still, I like movies like this that have<br/>something educational to offer.')
('Quatre', 'Thanks for taking me to see it, Van. That helped me<br/>brighten up my mood.')
('Judith', "I cried so much watching that. I'm surprised how<br/>much that movie really got to me...")
('Judith', 'The contrast in how Sheena Dirke looks is<br/>so striking. On the one hand, you have a positive<br/>revolutionary leader who never gives up hope...')
('Judith', "...and on the other hand, you have an ordinary young<br/>woman who's understandably scared and anxious<br/>about dying.")
('Van', 'Do you...need a handkerchief?')
('Judith', "I'll be okay. I'll have to touch up my makeup after<br/>this, though.")
('Judith', "Phew... That was kind of cathartic. I've had a lot on<br/>my mind after everything that's happened. I needed<br/>something like this.")
('Judith', 'So thanks, Van. I appreciate you doing this.')
('Van', "No problem. That's what I'm here for.")
('Bergard', 'That was certainly a movie that wore its title on its<br/>sleeve, glorifying Sheena Dirke the way that it did.')
('Bergard', 'What stood out to me about it is how it was able to<br/>take such a stark period of history and portray it in<br/>such an optimistic manner.')
('Van', "Some people might argue that depictin' the<br/>revolution that way is meant to make today's Republic<br/>look good.")
('Van', 'Could just be the natural result of the patriotism and<br/>nationalism found in the people making it,<br/>too, though.')
('Bergard', "Intriguing. I hadn't thought of it like that.")
('Bergard', 'There were some profound topics to consider with<br/>this one, Van. Were you still able to enjoy it<br/>despite that?')
('Van', "I did, Master! Swear! You don't...have to look at me<br/>like that.")
('System', 'Obtained brochure for Gloria: Dawn of<br/>the Revolution.')
('System', 'Having finished their break, Van and his crew<br/>resumed their work.')
('Agnès', 'Family relationships can be such tricky things to<br/>deal with.')
('Agnès', "There are some things you can forgive because you're<br/>related, but there're other things that are hard to<br/>compromise for that same reason.")
('Agnès', "I can really relate to Phillip's frustration in<br/>the movie...")
('Van', "How should I put it? I'm the last person in Zemuria<br/>who wants to come off as preachy, but...")
('Van', "When you have something to say to someone, you<br/>should say it while you still can. That's my motto.")
('Agnès', "...You're right, Van. I should talk to my dad while I<br/>still have the time.")
('Agnès', "I think I'll try reaching out to him before we<br/>visit Oración.")
('Agnès', "He's...not the easiest person to talk to, but it's the<br/>right thing to do.")
('Feri', 'I felt kinda sad watching that movie, to be honest.')
('Feri', "I guess having such an amazing dad isn't always<br/>so easy...")
('Van', "It definitely didn't look like how things are between<br/>you and your dad, that's for sure.")
('Van', "You don't feel any kind of pressure, even a little?<br/>I'm sure the adults among the warriors must have<br/>high expectations for you.")
('Feri', "Hmm... I dunno. I don't really think there is.")
('Feri', 'My dad is like my guidepost. He teaches me so much!<br/>I want to be someone like him when I grow up.')
('Van', "Got'cha. Knowing what I do about the two of you, I<br/>can see how you'd feel that way.")
('Van', "Maybe if Phillip was more dedicated like you are,<br/>things would've turned out a lot differently for him in<br/>that movie.")
('Aaron', 'Sons definitely tend to have a different kinda<br/>relationship with their dads compared to their moms.')
('Aaron', "And they really shouldn't try to force themselves to be<br/>all buddy-buddy if it doesn't come to them naturally,<br/>if you ask me.")
('Van', "You know, speaking of dads, I don't know if I've ever<br/>heard much about yours.")
('Aaron', "That's 'cause I never knew the guy. And Gien was<br/>much more of a grandfather to me.")
('Aaron', "Just goes to show that you don't need a dad in your<br/>life to make life work, I guess.")
('Van', 'Huh. Kind of a deep thought for you. I guess you do<br/>have a brain somewhere in that head of yours.')
('Aaron', 'Oh, shut up!')
('Risette', '*sigh* I still feel slightly on edge after watching that<br/>film, albeit in a good way.')
('Risette', 'The races were so engrossing. I could feel my hands<br/>tensing up before I even knew it.')
('Van', 'For a movie that puts the human drama front and<br/>center, they still put a lot of effort into the racing.')
('Van', "I'd love to hop in the passenger seat with a pro driver<br/>like that sometime and feel what it's like to whip a car<br/>around like that. Gotta be wild.")
('Risette', 'I will say, ordinarily, I strive to provide a safe,<br/>comfortable riding experience for my clients<br/>while driving.')
('Risette', "However, if you wish for me to make an exception, I<br/>can certainly show you what I'm truly capable of.")
('Van', "...I'm gonna be real with you, Risette. I'm more than<br/>a little tempted to take you up on it. But let's not get<br/>up to any trouble, all right?")
('Risette', 'Heehee. As you wish.')
('Risette', 'I appreciate your consideration, Mr. Arkride.')
('Risette', 'I was apprehensive about your response, but now I<br/>feel relieved.')
('Quatre', "I think I'm beginning to understand what you like<br/>about cars so much.")
('Quatre', "I can see how someone might get so attached to their<br/>vehicle when it provides so much freedom. It's like a<br/>partner in a lifelong adventure.")
('Quatre', 'It must feel pretty fun and cool to be able to get to<br/>drive around like that, I must admit.')
('Van', "Quatre, have you...have you seen the light?! Have you<br/>fallen in love with cars 'cause of that movie?")
('Van', "Finally, someone who gets me around here! I wasn't<br/>trying to convert you or anything, but man, am I glad<br/>I took you along now! Yes!")
('Quatre', "V-Van, calm down! Let's not get ahead of<br/>ourselves here.")
('Quatre', "I don't know that I'd say I've fallen in love with<br/>them...but it's making me think about getting<br/>my license.")
('Van', "That's great. Really great! If you want someone to<br/>teach you the basics, I'd be more than happy to—")
('Quatre', "I mean sometime in the FUTURE! I don't mean<br/>right this minute, okay?!")
('Quatre', "...Sorry. I don't mean to sound so flippant about it<br/>or anything.")
('Quatre', 'Thanks for inviting me, Van. I think I feel a little<br/>better after seeing that.')
('Judith', "That was a well-made movie. On the one hand,<br/>you've got that family drama of a dad and his son who<br/>can't see eye to eye, which is relatable.")
('Judith', "And then on the other hand, you've got the Z1,<br/>which brings something unique to the table.<br/>Those two things go really well together.")
('Van', 'The first movie was such a hit, too. I remember the<br/>script and direction both being solid stuff.')
('Judith', 'Totally. Apparently the actors got to drive around<br/>inside real high-speed cars while shooting again.')
('Judith', 'That sort of working environment is always a good<br/>recipe for getting raw, natural acting out of talent.<br/>You love to see it.')
('Judith', "Ack! You're making me go into actress mode with<br/>this conversation. Got to remember I'm not on<br/>the clock.")
('Judith', 'Anyway...thanks, Van. This is exactly what the<br/>doctor ordered. I feel much better now.')
('Bergard', "Those race scenes were an immersive sight, I'll give<br/>the movie that.")
('Bergard', 'The accident was perhaps a bit too graphic for my<br/>tastes, however.')
('Van', "Maybe, but I'd argue it was realistic call. That sort of<br/>thing happens a fair amount in the Z1 Grand Prix.")
('Van', "I think that's what draws people to it—it's a glitzy<br/>world that's got as much drama and tragedy as it<br/>does glory.")
('Bergard', 'So it seems. I admit to being more interested in it<br/>now, that much is true.')
('Bergard', 'I just might have to come down and watch one of the<br/>races once the new season starts.')
('Van', 'Haha. You can never have too many hobbies, can<br/>you, Master?')
('System', 'Obtained brochure for Perfect Driver 2.')
('System', 'Having finished their break, Van and his crew<br/>resumed their work.')
('Agnès', "*sigh* I can't even describe how I feel after seeing<br/>Mia's face when they go their separate ways.")
('Agnès', 'I really wanted Will to do more to hold on to her.')
('Van', "I can get that. But Will was probably trying to respect<br/>Mia's wishes.")
('Van', 'He let her go precisely because he loved her so much.')
('Agnès', "Hmm... It's still frustrating, though.")
('Agnès', "It's clear Will still had a lot of feelings for her in<br/>the end.")
('Agnès', "Besides, deep down, you can't ever lie about how<br/>you feel...")
('Van', "What was that? I didn't catch what you said.")
('Agnès', 'Oh, nothing! I was just thinking to myself.')
('Agnès', 'Thanks for inviting me, Van. I wish it had a better<br/>ending, but I still really enjoyed the movie.')
('Feri', "I get what happened in the movie. It's pretty easy<br/>to understand.")
('Feri', 'Except for one thing: why did those two have to<br/>break up?')
('Feri', "Couldn't they be boyfriend and girlfriend even if they<br/>lived apart?")
('Van', "If it was a different kinda relationship, I guess.<br/>There's nothing wrong with people who choose to<br/>do that.")
('Van', 'But I think once Will knew how determined Mia<br/>was, he felt like he had no choice but to accept her<br/>decision, even if it hurt.')
('Feri', 'Huh. Being an adult sounds so complicated...')
('Feri', 'I thought people always wanted to stay with the ones<br/>that they love.')
('Van', 'Haha. I like the way you think.')
('Van', "Be sure to hold on to that and don't throw it away<br/>once you grow up. You'll be glad you did.")
('Feri', 'Huh? Uh, okay. If you say so, Van.')
('Aaron', "Man, I dunno what the hell that doofus was thinking.<br/>I couldn't relate to him at all.")
('Aaron', "If I were in his shoes, I would've let instinct take over<br/>and held on to my girl tight—literally.")
('Van', 'Of course YOU would. You approach women<br/>guns blazing.')
('Van', "But evidently, Will couldn't bring himself to do that.<br/>He probably would've needed a good reason to do<br/>that after everything she said.")
('Aaron', "Sounds like you're just making excuses for someone<br/>who messed up. You telling me wussing out like that's<br/>supposed to be some kind of virtue?")
('Aaron', 'What kind of hot bullshit is that? You still working<br/>through some breakup you went through in school or<br/>something when you were younger?')
('Van', "No, I'm not, thank you!")
('Risette', "That was one of those films where you can come<br/>away with different things depending on which<br/>character's perspective you examine it through.")
('Van', 'True. Is it safe to say you sympathize more with<br/>Mia, then?')
('Risette', 'Initially, I thought that was the case. But the more I<br/>watched it, the more I found I saw the story<br/>through his eyes.')
('Risette', 'It may very well have to do with the nature of<br/>my work.')
('Risette', "You could say I...understand what it's like very well to<br/>see other people off and watch over them as you<br/>remain in place.")
('Van', 'True. With movies, your feelings and circumstances<br/>at the time you watch them can really affect how you<br/>react to them.')
('Van', "Sometimes if you come back to a movie after a good<br/>while and watch it again, you discover some<br/>interesting new things you didn't see before.")
('Risette', "I see. I hadn't considered that additional viewings<br/>could be rewarding in their own way. You gave me<br/>some food for thought, Mr. Arkride.")
('Quatre', 'As the title suggests, rain plays a key role in<br/>the movie.')
('Quatre', "If you pay close attention, you'll notice it always rains<br/>during important scenes in general—not just when<br/>they break up in the end.")
('Van', "Interesting. I didn't even notice. Good eye, Quatre.")
('Quatre', 'Thanks. If I had to guess, they probably did that so<br/>the emotional scenes make more of a lasting<br/>impression on viewers.')
('Van', "I was wonderin' what got you thinking so heavily.<br/>Guess you were just puttin' on your analytical hat for<br/>the movie like you always do, haha.")
('Van', "To be honest, I wasn't sure if you'd like it. I figured a<br/>researcher like you might find romance plots to be<br/>tedious and pointless.")
('Quatre', "You shouldn't have worried. I might be a researcher<br/>at heart, but that doesn't mean I can't enjoy more<br/>romantic or emotional stories, too.")
('Quatre', 'So thanks for bringing me, Van. This was a really<br/>nice time we had.')
('Van', "Hmm... There's a certain sweetness to Mia's<br/>lighthearted disposition that I really enjoyed.")
('Van', "And the way she went from lookin' so strong to those<br/>tears rolling down her face as it was raining, it was<br/>really—")
('Judith', "Can you NOT critique the movie like you're some<br/>film reviewer when I'm right here? You're making me<br/>feel self-conscious!")
('Judith', '...I guess I appreciate you noticing, though. I did put<br/>a lot of effort into putting on just the right expression<br/>for that scene.')
('Judith', "There's a certain pain and suffering Mia feels in that<br/>scene that she can't let on to Will in that moment.")
('Judith', "I wanted that to really sting for people in the<br/>audience who can't do anything but watch that<br/>sadness unfold.")
('Van', 'Ah, I can see that now that you mention it.')
('Van', "Just goes to show how talented you clearly are as an<br/>actress if you're able to pull off somethin'<br/>that complicated.")
('Judith', "Haha! That's really high praise coming from a movie<br/>buff as big as you. Thanks, Van. That means a lot.")
('Bergard', "It's a bittersweet moment to end a relationship in<br/>order to pursue one's dreams.")
('Bergard', 'I found this is the kind of movie that stays with you<br/>even as the credits roll.')
('Bergard', 'I doubt I would have seen this alone, but I still found<br/>it to be an engrossing watch, all things considered.')
('Van', 'Awesome. Glad to hear you enjoyed it, Master.')
('Van', "...You know, now that you mention it, I don't think<br/>you've ever mentioned anything about your love life<br/>to me. What gives?")
('Bergard', "Haha! I suppose it is because it isn't the kind of<br/>subject worth bringing up during a student's lessons.")
('Bergard', "Perhaps it wouldn't hurt to share a story or two about<br/>my youngers years if we ever get the chance. One of<br/>these days...")

('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Van? Is that you?')
('Hermès', "Heya. It's my favorite customer.")
('Van', 'Well, look who it is. You come here all by yourself?')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'M-Maybe. I was thinking it might be nice to maybe<br/>catch something and then before I knew it, I found<br/>myself here.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Did you come here to watch this movie, too?')
('Van', 'I guess you could say that.')
('Van', 'You were smart to pick a documentary. One of the<br/>better genres to enjoy by yourself, in my opinion.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'I know what you mean. Before I knew it, I was<br/>completely sucked into what was going on.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Except...at one point, I suddenly saw Dingo in<br/>my mind.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "But he didn't look like he was sad or in pain<br/>or anything.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'He was...smiling, softly. He looked like he was in<br/>such peace.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'It made me so happy to see that. Really happy, as a<br/>matter of fact.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Ugh... I'm sorry. I must sound crazy right now,<br/>talking like that.")
('Van', '...Nah. Not at all.')
('Van', 'Hearing that from you honestly brings me a<br/>little comfort. Thanks, Marielle.')
('Van', "Not used to seein' you here, of all places. What's<br/>the occasion?")
('Hermès', "Nothing much. I'd just had my eye on this movie<br/>since before it was out. I'm actually a bit of a<br/>mountain climber.")
('Hermès', 'Is that why you decided to watch it, too?')
('Van', "Nah. I'm just a movie junkie who'll watch a little<br/>of everything.")
('Van', 'I tend to watch a lot of plot-driven stuff when I go to<br/>the movies, but I enjoy a good documentary every<br/>now and again, too.')
('Hermès', "Good for you. There's something to be said for seeing<br/>such harsh yet beautiful vistas up on the big screen.")
('Hermès', 'Watching that movie made me want to go check all<br/>that out for myself one of these days.')
('Hermès', "When I'll actually get around to it, though,<br/>who knows? You know me—always got my hands<br/>more than a little full with work.")
('Van', "Don't I know it. We both need the clients to put food<br/>on the table, but work sure has a way of pilin' 'em on.")
('Van', 'I feel bad hitting you up as much as I do. Must not<br/>make things any easier for you.')
('Hermès', "Oh, don't you worry about me. It's always a pleasure<br/>hooking you up with what you need.")
('Hermès', "So keep those orders coming. I'll get them to your<br/>door faster than you can even hit 'send' no matter<br/>what time of day.")
('System', "Van's conversation in the theater continued for a<br/>brief period.")
('System', 'Soon enough, however, the two sides parted ways in<br/>the lobby. From there, Van got on with the rest of<br/>his evening.')
('System', "Obtained brochure for Climber's Story.")
('Agnès', 'The main character reminds me of Aaron in a lot<br/>of ways.')
('Agnès', 'He cares about his friends, he has a strong sense of<br/>justice, and he knows his way around a fight. Not to<br/>mention how people gave him a nickname.')
('Agnès', 'Apparently in Eastern cultures, peonies are<br/>considered to be the finest of all flowers. I feel like<br/>that adds a fun extra layer to it.')
('Van', "Somebody's done her homework. Good for you.")
('Van', "Yeah, comparin' pretty-looking men to flowers is<br/>definitely a thing they do in the East.")
('Agnès', "Hmm... Now I can't help but wonder what kind of<br/>flower you're most like, Van.")
('Van', "You...don't have to think too deep on that. Really.")
('Agnès', "Whoops. Maybe I shouldn't have said that out loud.")
('Agnès', 'Anyway, thanks, Van. I feel a little lighter after<br/>watching that.')
('Feri', 'My heart feels kinda...twisty now after seeing that.')
('Feri', "I'm glad the bad guy lost in the end.")
('Feri', "But that doesn't mean everything he did should be<br/>forgiven in my opinion. Does that make sense?")
('Van', '...You know, Feri? I agree.')
('Van', "We have the law to try and define what's good or bad,<br/>but when you get down to it, the only truth about it is<br/>the one you feel in your heart.")
('Van', "Always listen to what your heart tells you. You don't<br/>have to change how you feel just to make other<br/>people happy.")
('Van', 'Does that help at all?')
('Feri', '...Yeah. I guess a little.')
('Van', 'Fair enough. Wish I had more to offer in<br/>this situation.')
('Aaron', 'That last one-on-one fight was pretty well done.')
('Aaron', 'At least, well done for a couple of film actors.')
('Van', "Well, if you thought it was all right, they must've<br/>done a hell of a decent job.")
('Van', 'I bet you could act in a movie. Sure got the looks and<br/>talents to make it work.')
('Aaron', 'Actually, I did get an offer to work on a film<br/>one time.')
('Aaron', "Didn't really sound like my jam, though, so I turned<br/>it down. Would've had me doing completely vanilla<br/>stuff, which wasn't exciting to me.")
('Van', "That's what you said to them? *sigh* I kinda feel for<br/>the poor sap who must've been on the other end of<br/>that conversation.")
('Risette', 'In a lot of ways, that was a very conventional story of<br/>good triumphing over evil.')
('Risette', 'However, at a time like this, there is something to be<br/>said for the comfort that such a movie can provide.')
('Van', "You're tellin' me. It couldn't have shown up at a<br/>better time.")
('Van', 'Too bad those sorts of clean, happy endings are only<br/>the stuff of fiction, though.')
('Risette', "Indeed. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't do our<br/>best within our means regardless.")
('Risette', "Be that as it may, please, always remember that I'm<br/>here, Mr. Arkride, every minute of every day.<br/>You needn't take on too much all by yourself.")
('Van', "...Thanks, Risette. Believe me, I'll be leaning on<br/>you plenty.")
('Quatre', 'That feint that the hero pulls off using the same move<br/>as his father really got my blood pumping.')
('Quatre', "You could see how much he's grown as a character<br/>when he took down the villain.")
('Van', "Absolutely. There's definitely a real thrill watchin' it<br/>happen as the audience after seeing him go on<br/>that journey.")
('Quatre', "Well, it'd be a pretty big letdown if he didn't pull<br/>through in the end, wouldn't it?")
('Quatre', "Children are supposed to surpass their parents, and<br/>students are supposed to surpass their teachers.<br/>That's the way it's meant to be.")
('Van', 'Spoken like a student on his way to doing just that.')
('Quatre', '...Things may have become dire, but my role and<br/>what I should be doing is still the same as ever.')
('Quatre', "As a researcher and student of Professor Hamilton,<br/>I'll do whatever I can to support you in terms<br/>of technology. I'm here for you, Van.")
('Judith', "As you can maybe imagine, that movie wasn't exactly<br/>on my radar before today. But count me pleasantly<br/>surprised by it.")
('Judith', "The lead actor's action chops were on point, and the<br/>costume and set designs were definitely unrefined, but<br/>not without their charm.")
('Van', "Yeah, it's definitely a B-movie in terms of its size and<br/>scope, but it's as well executed as anything made on a<br/>heftier budget.")
('Van', "If anything, that humbleness might've enabled the<br/>filmmakers to be more expressive than they would've<br/>otherwise managed.")
('Judith', "...Should we really be talking shop about movies at a<br/>time like this, though? Don't we have more important<br/>things to worry about?")
('Judith', 'No, I take that back. We need moments like this now<br/>more than ever.')
('Judith', "As an actress myself, I can only hope people are able<br/>to find solace and comfort in our work, even if it's just<br/>a little bit.")
('Van', "Yeah. Can't get enough of that in this day and age.")
('System', 'Obtained brochure for The Peony Blade.')
('System', 'Having finished their break, Van and his crew<br/>resumed their work.')
('Agnès', "That movie...definitely took a turn, I think it's fair<br/>to say.")
('Agnès', "That wasn't exactly what I expected it to be.")
('Van', "To put it lightly. Sorry if that was disappointing.<br/>Thought it was just gonna be some cutesy cartoon, so<br/>that's why I invited you along.")
('Agnès', 'Oh, no, no! I still enjoyed it! That surprise was part of<br/>the fun!')
('Agnès', "The more I watched that movie, the more I found<br/>myself liking that mean little Mishy. He's cute!")
('Van', 'Cute? That thing?! Did you forget what he does?')
('Feri', "I don't get it. So was that Mishy some kinda<br/>stuffed animal that had mystical powers?")
('Feri', "It seemed like he was different from FIO and<br/>XEROS, but that's all I could understand.")
('Van', "It's meant to have a certain kinda humor, but I guess<br/>it's not for everyone.")
('Van', "Sorry, Feri. I could've done better picking a movie<br/>you'd enjoy.")
('Feri', "Oh, I didn't hate it or anything like that! It's okay!")
('Feri', "I just hate not being able to understand what's<br/>going on. I'll have to watch it again to see if I can<br/>figure it out.")
('Feri', "Let's see it again together, Van! I wanna try<br/>pushing myself!")
('Van', "Sure. I'll take you, Feri. I like your attitude!")
('Aaron', 'Damn, that movie sure went some crazy places by the<br/>end of it!')
('Aaron', 'I dig it. That shit was hilarious!')
('Aaron', "Man, if I had a magic doll that could grant me<br/>wishes, you know what I'd ask it?")
('Van', "Yes, I know EXACTLY what you'd ask,<br/>you horndog. Keep it to yourself. We're in pub—")
('Aaron', "I'd ask it to give me a room full of Calvard's finest<br/>babes so we could all go off and wet each other's<br/>whistles, if you know what I mean.")
('Van', "Now you're just tryin' to make a scene!")
('Risette', 'That was a very peculiar film, I think we can agree.')
('Risette', "I suppose one might argue that it's something of a<br/>morality tale—although it's perhaps rather<br/>overwhelming as a teaching tool for children.")
('Van', "Definitely a weird-ass film, at the very least. I can<br/>only imagine how many kids it's gonna end<br/>up traumatizing.")
('Van', "Might wanna warn Victor and Paulette about what's<br/>in store before it's too late.")
('Risette', "Heehee. That's very sweet of you to think of Yumé,<br/>Mr. Arkride.")
('Quatre', 'At first, I thought that Mishy was maybe something<br/>of an imaginary friend to the kid in that movie.')
('Quatre', "But that's certainly not what you get by the end.")
('Van', "That thing wasn't out to set him straight so much as<br/>get its revenge on him outright.")
('Quatre', "Yeah. Can't really call it a friend by any<br/>definition, ahaha.")
('Quatre', "I guess when you get down to it, the story's not really<br/>about how amazing that Mishy doll is as much as it is<br/>the heart of the kid using him.")
('Judith', 'Oh, Crossbell...')
('Judith', "I'd love to catch a show live there one of these days.")
('Van', "Who're you talking about? You don't mean<br/>Mish—oh! You mean one of her shows, huh?")
('Judith', "Bingo. Not that I don't want to pay a visit to<br/>Mishelam Wonderland, either, of course.")
('Judith', 'A good vacation there where I can just take off,<br/>indulge in a ton of local theater, and maybe get Mishy<br/>to hug me once or twice sounds just perfect.')
('Judith', "Not that I'll get the chance to anytime soon with my<br/>work schedule being so hectic, unfortunately.")
('Van', "Plus you can't exactly step away from your side hustle<br/>willy-nilly, can you?")
('Judith', "Yeah, that's true, too... One of these days, though!<br/>I don't know how, but I'm going to make it happen<br/>or die trying!")
('Bergard', "Hahaha! I haven't thought about Mishy in a<br/>good while.")
('Van', "I didn't realize you'd even heard of him<br/>before, Master.")
('Van', "Guess it just goes to show how famous he's become<br/>for someone who's meant to just be a local mascot.")
('Bergard', 'When I was with the church, I found myself in<br/>Crossbell on countless occasions.')
('Bergard', 'I never met him while there, but DID hear of<br/>him often. I never took him to be quite so...stark of<br/>a personality.')
('Van', "That's only a Calvard thing from what I know.<br/>The real Mishy's supposed to be way less malicious<br/>than the movie version.")
('System', 'Obtained brochure for Mishy in Boots.')
('System', 'Having finished their break, Van and his crew<br/>resumed their work.')
('Inspector Daswani', 'Oh, great. Just who I wanted to find here. Good to<br/>see you, spriggan.')
('Van', "You're not gonna lecture me here, too, are<br/>you, Inspector?")
('Van', "I just came to take in a movie all by myself, that's it.<br/>Not here to cause any trouble.")
('Inspector Daswani', "...I didn't say I thought you were.")
('Inspector Daswani', "Besides, I'd rather not spend this precious downtime<br/>I've got giving anybody grief if I can at all help it.")
('Van', "Well, that's good to hear. Not gonna catch<br/>me complainin'.")
('Van', 'From the look of things, it seems like you had to<br/>scramble to catch the last showing tonight.')
('Inspector Daswani', 'Pretty much.')
('Inspector Daswani', 'I was running around, dealing with so many cases and<br/>accidents tonight that before I knew it, it was almost<br/>closing time here.')
('Van', 'You must really like your movies to go to that much<br/>trouble to make it here anyway.')
('Inspector Daswani', "I suppose. I'd also been really wanting to watch this<br/>movie in general as a medical drama.")
('Inspector Daswani', 'It gave me a lot to think about as a parent.')
('Inspector Daswani', 'It made me wonder what I would do if my daughter<br/>ever wound up like the little girl does that the intern<br/>takes in...')
('Van', "Heh. Didn't realize you had it in you to be<br/>so sentimental.")
('Inspector Daswani', "...And what's that supposed to mean?")
('System', "Van's conversation in the theater continued for a<br/>brief period.")
('System', 'Soon enough, however, the two sides parted ways in<br/>the lobby. From there, Van got on with the rest of<br/>his evening.')
('System', 'Obtained brochure for This Side of Heaven.')
('Feri', "Ugh. There's nothing scarier than an enemy you can't<br/>even see.")
('Feri', "They're so tough to deal with. You can't ambush<br/>them and you can't do any diversions, either. It sucks.")
('Van', "THAT'S what you were thinking about the<br/>whole time?")
('Van', 'Just to be clear, you do understand it was all made<br/>up, right? None of that was real.')
('Feri', "So? I've gotta be prepared in case we ever encounter<br/>any ghosts. Who knows when or where we might<br/>find one!")
('Feri', "But don't worry, Van! If that ever happens, I'll<br/>protect you! You and everybody else! Okay?")
('Van', "Uhh, okay. 'Preciate you watching our backs, Feri.<br/>(Guess I'll take this over her comin' out of it super<br/>spooked, at least.)")
('Aaron', "Y'know, at first I thought this was just gonna be some<br/>low budget, B-grade schlock.")
('Aaron', "But that was actually pretty damn entertaining.<br/>Emily's face when she got all possessed was<br/>messed up.")
('Van', 'Yeah, that scene was definitely a shocker.')
('Van', "...Tell me somethin', Aaron. If someone you knew<br/>wound up like her, what would you do?")
('Aaron', "...I'd try to save them. But if that wouldn't work, then<br/>I'd put 'em out of their misery.")
('Aaron', "It'd suck, but it'd be the best thing for them.<br/>Better than letting them suffer.")
('Van', "That's about what I figured you'd say, yeah. Can't say<br/>I'm terribly surprised.")
('Aaron', "Well, sorry I'm so predictable, I guess. What do<br/>you want?")
('Risette', "That was very entertaining. I've never seen a horror<br/>film before this.")
('Risette', 'I can understand now why someone would go out of<br/>their way to subject themselves to such fear. I imagine<br/>it becomes addicting.')
('Van', 'You seemed to handle that movie like a<br/>trooper, though. Not that I expected anything else<br/>from the likes of you.')
('Risette', 'Heehee. Perhaps, but I certainly still felt my heart<br/>race as I was watching it.')
('Risette', "Perhaps next time I watch such a film, I'll do so<br/>at night. I'm sure that must add to the ambience.")
('Quatre', "Anybody reasonable would recognize that visiting<br/>such an old mansion in the middle of the night isn't<br/>without its own risks. And yet...")
('Quatre', "...I'm embarrassed that movie still managed to scare<br/>so much despite knowing what those characters were<br/>in for. *sigh*")
('Van', "Haha, yeah. I was keepin' an eye on you during the<br/>movie and you looked pretty real spooked at times,<br/>that's for sure.")
('Quatre', 'Really? It was that obvious?')
('Van', 'Mm-hmm. I feel bad now. Sorry if you were too<br/>scared to have much of a good time back there.')
('Van', "I tried keepin' my arm on the arm rest so you could<br/>hold on to it if you needed, you know. I wouldn't<br/>have minded.")
('Quatre', "Th-That's okay! You really didn't have to go to that<br/>much trouble! Ugh, I swear, Van...")
('Judith', 'You know, when you get down to it, there tend to be<br/>two main kinds of horror movies.')
('Judith', "You've got ones that deal in jump scares and then<br/>ones that prefer to have a more encroaching sense<br/>of dread.")
('Judith', "My problem with jump scares is that you never know<br/>if you're reacting because you're genuinely scared, or<br/>you're just caught by surprise.")
('Van', 'Yeah, I totally get what you mean by that.')
('Van', "They're a real cornerstone of the genre, but a lot of<br/>movies use 'em too much as a crutch.")
('Judith', "I guess what I'm trying to say is, what good is a horror<br/>movie if there's no real fear to enjoy? Because fear<br/>and surprise aren't the same thing.")
('Judith', "...I'm going to have to talk to the director next time<br/>I'm on set. I don't want to be doing the same boring<br/>things as other movies.")
('Van', "(Guess I know what genre we'll see her in next.)")
('Van', "(Gotta respect how much passion she has for her<br/>job—even if it's something of a liability at times.)")
('Bergard', 'The sensibilities of the young are interesting<br/>to consider. I get a kick out of it, you might say.')
('Bergard', "I hadn't realized they made movies where the<br/>characters encounter ghosts and then try to<br/>escape them. You learn something new every day.")
('Van', "Heh. In hindsight, maybe it wasn't the best idea to<br/>take a man of the church to see a movie like<br/>that, huh?")
('Bergard', 'Oh, something like this does not offend me in<br/>the least. You have nothing to worry about.')
('Bergard', "For better or worse, it's human nature for people to<br/>treat things they cannot see with fear and awe.")
('Bergard', "I'm just impressed these movie makers have found a<br/>way to harness that reaction and turn it into<br/>something entertaining.")
('Van', 'Uh, Agnès? You doing okay?')
('Agnès', "Wh-What do you mean? I'm... I'm perfectly<br/>fine, really!")
('Agnès', 'I had you there next to me the whole time.<br/>What more could I have needed to feel safe?')
('Agnès', 'Sure, it got my heart really pounding and blood<br/>racing, but...')
('Agnès', "...other than that...I'm...I'm...")
('Van', 'Agnès? Agnès, wake up! AGNÈS!')
('System', "After being carried to the doctor's office and taking a<br/>brief rest, Agnès came back to her senses and fully<br/>recovered, good as new.")
('System', 'Obtained brochure for Midnight Memories.')
('System', 'Having finished their break, Van and his crew<br/>resumed their work.')
('Van', "(Hey, looks like they're sellin' commemorative<br/>brochures for this movie.)")
('Van', '(Maybe I should pick one up as a souvenir. Hmm...)')
('Van', "(Whoops. Guess I'm a little short.)")
('Agnès', "Well, we're in the Tyrell District.")
('Feri', 'Now to talk to as many people as we can and see if<br/>we can find anyone who knows this Jessica lady.')
('Feri', "Well, what're we waiting for? Let's get to work!")
('Van', "Hold up a sec, kiddo. I've got an idea who we should<br/>probably hit up first.")
('Van', "There's a producer who often hangs out around here<br/>to tryin' to recruit new people to be mannequins.")
('Van', "Let's talk to him before we try askin' anyone else.<br/>Might save us a lot of wandering around.")
('Feri', "Manny...kin? I've never heard of that. What do<br/>they do?")
('Agnès', "He means models—people who wear clothes to<br/>advertise new outfits. And Van's right that Jessica is<br/>pretty enough to be noticed by a producer.")
('Van', "I know for a fact I've seen him hanging out along the<br/>main street.")
('Van', "Let's walk around and see if he's out hustling again.")
('Agnès', "Hello! You're Jess, aren't you?")
('Jess', "Uh... Hey. Haven't I seen you guys before?")
('Agnès', "We've met before, yes. It's good to see you.")
('Jess', 'Sorry, but mind if you refresh my memory?')
('Van', "We're with Arkride Solutions.")
('Van', "You put out a request askin' for our help, yeah?<br/>That's what we're here to talk about. Care to fill<br/>us in on what's going on?")
('Jess', 'Wow! You really came after all. I mean, not that I<br/>doubted you guys or anything, but...still.')
('Jess', "Anyway, you guys should probably sit down.<br/>It's going to take me a while to explain everything.")
('Jess', "So to give you guys a brief introduction, as you know,<br/>my name's Jess. I'm a singer and songwriter—if I can<br/>even really call myself that.")
('Jess', "I just started doing all of that pretty recently, so it's<br/>not like I'm famous or anything close to that.")
('Agnès', 'Well, I thought your music was really great when I<br/>heard it earlier! You should be proud of it.')
('Feri', "Was it really? Aww! I wish I could've heard it!")
('Jess', 'Haha, thanks. You girls are too kind.')
('Jess', "Now that I think about it, I feel like I've been seeing<br/>you guys more and more around my neighborhood.")
('Van', "That's probably 'cause our office is located in<br/>Old Town.")
('Feri', "Wow! You can sing AND write songs? That's<br/>so cool! I didn't know there were people who could<br/>do both.")
('Jess', "Haha. I don't think it's that big of a deal, but thanks.")
('Jess', "Actually, maybe it's just me, but I feel like I've seen<br/>you guys around my neighborhood before.")
('Van', 'Think I recognize you, too, as a matter of fact.<br/>Our office is located in Old Town, if that means<br/>anything to you.')
('Jess', "Oh! No kidding? That's where the three of us live!")
('Feri', "That's neat! Who else do you live with?")
('Jess', "I live with some friends I've known since we<br/>were kids. We all came up to Edith from the<br/>countryside and decided to room together.")
('Jess', 'One of them is this guy named Raymond. He works<br/>at the flower shop.')
('Jess', "The other is Raymond's older sister, Carol. She works<br/>at the boutique.")
('Van', "Got'cha. Good to know.")
('Jess', 'And just to be clear, I promise not to go around<br/>talking to people about you guys or anything.')
('Jess', "This isn't exactly the sort of request I want Raymond<br/>and Carol to know about anyway, so it's really for<br/>the best.")
('Feri', "You wrote that you wanted us to remove your<br/>information from somebody's notebook. Could you<br/>go into that a little more?")
('Jess', 'Sure. But before I do, I need to ask: have you guys<br/>ever heard of a guy named Giacomo before?')
('Agnès', 'Did you say Giacomo?!')
('Van', 'You could say we know him—for better or for worse.')
('Jess', 'Oh, great. That saves me the trouble of having to<br/>explain who he is.')
('Jess', 'Basically, the notebook I wrote about is this one he<br/>keeps full of material to blackmail people.')
('Feri', "Yikes. I knew that notebook wasn't good news based<br/>on the title of your request, but that sounds super bad.")
('Van', "Can't say I'm surprised he'd have such a thing, but it<br/>doesn't put him in any better of a light, that's for<br/>damn sure.")
('Van', "How'd you find out you were in his little black book?")
('Jess', 'Well, once I started to make a name for myself doing<br/>music stuff, he ambushed me outside the concert hall<br/>one day.')
('Jess', 'What he said really freaked me out.')
('Jess', "He told me that he knew my secret and if I didn't<br/>want it getting out to the wrong guy, I'd have to help<br/>him with his work.")
('Jess', "I haven't seen Giacomo at all since then, but I want<br/>that information scrubbed out of his notebook before<br/>he has a chance to do anything with it.")
('Feri', "That's despicable! It's one thing to play dirty on the<br/>battlefield, but threatening a private citizen is<br/>just low!")
('Feri', '...Wait. Hold on a second.')
('Feri', "Van, weren't you talking about Giacomo just the<br/>other day?")
('Van', "Yeah, and for a reason our client here might like<br/>to know: Giacomo's dead.")
('Van', "I can't go into the specific circumstances of what<br/>happened with someone like you, but I figured it's<br/>worth clearin' up that much.")
('Jess', 'Are you serious?! I had no idea!')
('Jess', "Now I'm worried... If he's dead, what could've<br/>happened to the notebook?")
('Agnès', 'Ordinarily, something like that would be in the<br/>custody of the police.')
('Van', "But this is Giacomo we're talking about. He wouldn't<br/>let one of the tools of his trade fall into the hands of<br/>the police so easily.")
('Van', "My bet is he kept it hidden. Odds are about 50-50 as<br/>to whether the cops've managed to uncover it or not.")
('Van', "It's probably in our best interests to figure out where<br/>he stashed it or what's become of it.")
('Jess', 'Sure, that makes sense to me.')
('Jess', "Even if the police might have it in their possession,<br/>I'd appreciate you guys going out and checking just to<br/>make sure.")
('Feri', 'What do you say, Van? Are we gonna help him?')
('Jess', "There's some information about me in Giacomo's<br/>blackmail notebook I need you guys to erase for me.")
('Jess', "Would you guys be willing to help me? You're the<br/>only ones I can turn to here.")
('Van', "I'm not against us taking up your case.")
('Van', 'But we got some other stuff that needs our<br/>attention first. Mind if we come back and talk to you<br/>again later?')
('Jess', "Sure, that's fine. At this point, I just appreciate you<br/>guys hearing me out.")
('Jess', "No need to rush. I'll be hanging around here till<br/>nightfall, so take your time.")
('Van', "Don't worry. We'll take the case.")
('Van', "Our first stops should probably be Giacomo's two<br/>hideouts that we visited before. We should sift<br/>through 'em and see what we find.")
('Van', "I'm sure the guy had other spots while he was alive,<br/>but with any luck, something'll turn up and we won't<br/>have to go through any more trouble.")
('Agnès', 'That makes sense. We already know where the two<br/>hideouts are, so we might as well investigate them.')
('Feri', "Sounds good to me! I can't wait to see you guys do<br/>your thing! I'm sure I'm gonna learn a lot about being<br/>a spriggan!")
('Van', "Once we come to some sort of conclusion, we'll be<br/>sure to contact you with whatever news we have.")
('Van', "Until then, sit tight. We've got you covered.")
('Jess', "Perfect. Thank you guys so much for doing this!<br/>You don't know how much I appreciate it.")
('System', 'Quest Blacking Out Blackmail started!')
('Van', "It took some doing, but we managed to track down<br/>Giacomo's little black book.")
('Van', 'We found the information concerning you on this<br/>page here.')
('Van', 'Could you take a look at it and confirm this is what<br/>you want gone?')
('Jess', '...Yes, this is it.')
('Jess', "This is the information about me that I absolutely<br/>don't want getting out at any cost.")
('Jess', 'Is it...all right if I tear out the page and photo and<br/>throw them away?')
('Van', "Totally. Do whatever you want with 'em.<br/>They're yours now.")
('System', 'Jess proceeded to tear the notebook page and<br/>photograph into fine pieces.')
('Jess', "Phew... I think I'll rest a little easier<br/>knowing that stuff isn't out there anymore.")
('Jess', "Although, no offense, if I'm being completely honest,<br/>I wish you guys hadn't ended up finding out about<br/>my...circumstances.")
('Jess', 'As for who those lyrics were about, well...')
('Van', 'I think I have an idea of who it might be.')
('Van', "I'll say this: there are plenty of people like you who<br/>live out in the open these days. You shouldn't feel like<br/>you have to keep that bottled up.")
('Jess', "Yeah, I know that. It's not like I would really mind if<br/>people in society knew who I was. That's not what<br/>I'm worried about.")
('Jess', "I'm more...trying not to ruin what I have with my<br/>childhood friends, if that makes sense.")
('Jess', "So if you guys could still keep all of that to yourselves,<br/>I'd really, really appreciate it.")
('Van', "Of course. It'd be bad for business if people thought<br/>they couldn't trust us with their personal details<br/>like that.")
('Agnès', "Absolutely. We promise we'll maintain the strictest<br/>confidentiality about your case.")
('Feri', "Uhh, I don't really understand what you guys are<br/>talking about, but don't worry! We'll never tell<br/>anybody about you no matter what!")
('Jess', "Thank you. I'm sorry if it sounded like I don't trust<br/>you guys. I just...needed that extra reassurance, is all.")
('Jess', "Anyway, you guys can have the notebook back now.<br/>I'm not the only one in it, so I really shouldn't be the<br/>one to hold on to it.")
('Jess', "I'll let you guys figure out how to dispose of it, if<br/>that's okay.")
('Van', "No problem. We're more than happy to handle that.")
('Jess', "I think that's it for me. Thank you guys so, so much<br/>for doing this. You don't know how relieved I am to<br/>have all of that behind me...")
('Jess', "I'll deposit the money into your account soon.<br/>See you all later!")
('Van', 'All right—now to take care of that notebook once<br/>and for all.')
('Feri', 'What a scary thing that notebook is. Are you<br/>planning to use it for yourself, Van?')
('Van', "No way. Considering how Giacomo must've sourced<br/>that info, keepin' it would be asking for nothing<br/>but trouble.")
('Van', "I'm turning it over to the cops. It'll be a good way to<br/>get them to owe us a favor, digging up something as<br/>valuable as this.")
('Agnès', "It's always give-and-take with you, Van, isn't it?")
('System', 'From there, the party did exactly as Van suggested,<br/>submitting the notebook to the police station as key<br/>evidence in the murder case.')
('System', 'They asked that it be delivered straight to Inspector<br/>Daswani, who would know exactly what to do with it.')
('System', 'Quest Blacking Out Blackmail completed!')
('System', 'Earned')
('System', 'Received')
('Van', "'Scuse me. Are you Amy?")
('Van', "We're from Arkride Solutions. Did you need our help<br/>with somethin'?")
('Amy', "Oh! Yes, I do! Thank you guys for coming. I can't<br/>believe you're actually real!")
('Amy', 'Not to be rude, but do you mind if I get straight to<br/>business and explain what I need?')
('Van', "Not at all. Let's get down to it.")
('Agnès', 'Basically, you want us to search for your missing<br/>boyfriend, right?')
('Feri', "You wrote that you want us to find your missing<br/>boyfriend, didn't you?")
('Aaron', 'Long story short, you need us to go hunt down your<br/>missing boyfriend, yeah?')
('Van', 'Could you tell us about what happened leading up to<br/>his disappearance?')
('Amy', "Sure. So, my boyfriend's name is Mark. We've been<br/>going out for four years now.")
('Amy', "Things have been great between us, except...he's in<br/>a gang.")
('Amy', "They've had him do shady jobs and all kinds of bad<br/>things since he joined from what I can tell.")
('Amy', "That's why when I knew he was missing, I couldn't<br/>turn to the police.")
('Agnès', "And that's why you turned to us. That makes sense.")
('Feri', "Oh, so that's why you contacted us. I get it now.")
('Aaron', 'And so you figured you had to call in a spriggan if you<br/>wanted to get to the bottom of it?')
('Amy', 'Yes, exactly. But, I should make something clear<br/>about Mark.')
('Amy', "He might be in a gang, but deep down, he's such a<br/>reasonable, honest guy. Really!")
('Amy', 'Once we started dating, he promised me he would get<br/>his act together and change his ways.')
('Amy', 'I was even thinking about marrying him in the future.')
('Amy', 'Then a month ago, he told me that he was finally<br/>going to leave the gang for good.')
('Amy', "That's the last I ever heard from him. I haven't seen<br/>hide nor hair of him since.")
('Van', "So he vanished right as he was about to pull out, huh?<br/>That's some timing.")
('Van', "Any number of things could've happened, but it all<br/>definitely raises some eyebrows.")
('Van', 'You know the name of the gang he belongs to, by<br/>any chance?')
('Amy', "Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's called 'Desire' or something<br/>along those lines.")
('Amy', "That's all I really know. He never went into any more<br/>detail beyond the name when we talked.")
('Agnès', 'Have you heard of them, Van?')
('Feri', 'Does that ring any bells, Van?')
('Aaron', 'Desire, huh? What a corny-ass name for a bunch<br/>of goons.')
('Aaron', 'You know who those people are, chief?')
('Van', "Oh, yeah. I've heard that name come up here and<br/>there recently. Can't say I know all that much about<br/>them myself, though.")
('Van', "If we decide to search for this guy, we'll have to see<br/>what we can learn about them first.")
('Amy', "I tried as much as I could to look into it, but I<br/>couldn't figure out where Mark went.")
('Amy', 'You guys are the only hope I have now. Please, is<br/>there any way you could possibly help...?')
('Amy', "I tried as much as I could to track my boyfriend<br/>down, but I couldn't figure out where he went.")
('Amy', 'You guys are the only hope I have now. Please, is<br/>there any way you could possibly help...?')
('Van', "Hmm... Could you give us a little time? I'm not<br/>against taking up your case, but there's somethin' else<br/>we need to handle first.")
('Van', 'I hate to do this, but can we come back and talk to<br/>you later?')
('Amy', "I... I understand. I'll wait here until you're ready.<br/>Thanks for listening...")
('Van', "Sure, I don't see why not. Consider us on board.")
('Amy', "*sniffle* Oh, thank you! You don't know how much<br/>that means to me!")
('Van', "Don't go thanking us just yet—we haven't even<br/>gotten started.")
('Van', "Let's review what we know and then figure out our<br/>plan of attack. Basically, our man Mark was<br/>determined to get out of Desire so he could live clean.")
('Van', "But after making that intention clear, he's been<br/>incommunicado for a month, which brings us<br/>to today.")
('Agnès', "Given what we know, it's entirely possible he ran into<br/>some kind of trouble once he actually tried to leave.")
('Agnès', 'If we could find someone who knows about the<br/>gang, it might be a good idea to ask if they have any<br/>idea what happened. How does that sound, Van?')
('Feri', "He could've gotten into some kinda trouble once he<br/>actually tried to leave. That's what I think.")
('Feri', 'Maybe we should try searching for someone who<br/>knows about the gang and ask if they know what<br/>happened to him. What do you think, Van?')
('Aaron', "My bet's things didn't exactly go to plan once the guy<br/>actually tried to pull out.")
('Aaron', 'Probably need to find someone with an in to the gang<br/>and talk to them—see if they have any clue what<br/>happened to the guy.')
('Van', 'You read my mind. I think I know just the person we<br/>should hit up.')
('Van', "If we're talkin' about a gangster here, then chances<br/>are good he's had his fair share of weapons business to<br/>take care of from time to time.")
('Van', 'Might wanna stop by the gun shop in the department<br/>store over on Station Street and have a talk with<br/>the shopkeeper.')
('Amy', "Wow! You guys are already so on top of things!<br/>I'm so glad I decided to reach out to you.")
('Amy', "Well, thanks for helping me find Mark. I'll leave it in<br/>your capable hands to figure out things now.")
('Van', "You can always count on us professionals.<br/>We'll contact you again once we have more<br/>information about him. Till then, sit tight.")
('System', 'Quest A Lost Lover started!')
('Amy', "That was fast! I didn't expect to see you guys again<br/>so soon.")
('Amy', "Does that mean you found some kind of lead<br/>on Mark? It's okay if it's nothing big. I'll take<br/>anything you have! I want to know.")
('Agnès', 'Err, Van? What should we say?')
('Feri', 'Uhh, about that...')
('Aaron', "What's it gonna be, chief? Need to say something.")
('Van', "I know. I'm just trying to figure out how to put it.<br/>Gimme a sec.")
('Van', "(I can either respect Amy's wishes here and give her<br/>the cold, hard truth...)")
('Van', "(...or I can respect Mark's wishes and cover it up so<br/>she doesn't go on mournin' him.)")
('Van', "(Either way, she's not getting out of this<br/>conversation unscathed.)")
('Van', "(It's up to me to choose how this case ends. I have to<br/>decide what's ultimately best and stick with it.)")
('Van', "(...I'm gonna give it to her straight. She's the client,<br/>after all.)")
('Van', "Well, a friend of Mark's gave us a letter that he wrote.")
('Van', "You should read it first—then we'll tell you what<br/>happened to Mark.")
('Amy', "This handwriting... It's definitely his.")
('Amy', 'It says he wrote this the night before he left for<br/>work...?')
('Amy', '...')
('System', 'After reading the letter, Amy was left in tears, at<br/>which point Van divulged what he read in the online<br/>news article.')
('Amy', 'Mark sounded so confident that everything was going<br/>to be okay. I completely believed him.')
('Amy', "I knew it wasn't going to be easy for him to leave the<br/>gang, but...")
('Amy', 'Why...? Why did I tell him we could get married if he<br/>cut ties with them?!')
('Amy', "If I hadn't said that, he...he...!")
('Amy', '*sob*')
('Van', '...')
('Agnès', '...')
('Feri', '...')
('Aaron', '...')
('Amy', "I'm...sorry you had to see all that. I'm okay now.")
('Amy', "Thank you for delivering the letter to me and<br/>uncovering all of that. I'll be forever grateful to the<br/>two of you.")
('Van', "Wish we had happier news to give you, but that's how<br/>it goes in this line of work sometimes.")
('Amy', 'Yes, I understand... Can I...ask you for one<br/>more thing?')
('Van', 'What is it?')
('Amy', 'Will you guys...help me get revenge on Almata?')
('Agnès', "That's...")
('Feri', 'Amy...I understand how you feel, but...')
('Aaron', "...Can't say I didn't see this coming.")
('Amy', "I'll do what I can—whatever you ask. I'll give you as<br/>much money as you need! Just...please! It can't end<br/>like this!")
('Van', "If you're not just talkin' and are willin' to put your<br/>money where you mouth is, then sure, I'll consider it.")
('Amy', "You will? You'd do that for me?!")
('Van', "Course. Money buys you lotsa stuff from a spriggan.<br/>But you really think that's the best way to honor your<br/>boyfriend's memory?")
('Van', 'You might not wanna hear this, but now that you<br/>know as much as you do, you have a certain<br/>responsibility to carry out.')
('Amy', 'I do? What are you talking about?')
('Van', 'Mark loved you so much, he tried to quit his gang so<br/>he could live legit with you.')
('Van', 'All he probably ever wanted was to lead a normal,<br/>happy life without dragging you into the underworld.')
('Van', 'He risked his life to make that happen and paid<br/>the price. Do you think going out and getting your<br/>hands dirty is going to bring any happiness?')
('Amy', '...')
('Agnès', "I understand how you think you can't forgive yourself<br/>for what you said.")
('Agnès', 'But Mark was trying to protect you, too. Try not to<br/>forget that.')
('Feri', "Even if you somehow got your revenge, he's<br/>still gone. Nothing you do can bring him back.<br/>Believe me, I know...")
('Aaron', "*sigh* There you go again, old man.<br/>Sometimes you're too damn soft for your own good.")
('Amy', '...')
('Amy', "I'm sorry. You're absolutely right. The last thing I<br/>want to do is disrespect his feelings.")
('Van', "Eh, I might've been a little presumptuous with what I<br/>said, too. I could've worded that better.")
('Van', "I'll keep my opinions to myself from here on. All I'll<br/>say is, you should really think carefully about how<br/>you want to proceed.")
('Amy', "Right... Thank you. That was really shortsighted of<br/>me to say that, so...I'm going to sit down and really<br/>process my feelings after this.")
('Amy', "Anyway, I think I'm going to leave now. Thank you<br/>again, both of you—and take care.")
('Van', "(Probably best to respect Mark's wishes and keep it all<br/>a secret. Here goes.)")
('Van', "Well, we talked to an info broker we know and had<br/>them look into your boyfriend's case.")
('Van', "Turns out that he's been seeing a foreign chick who'd<br/>been traveling through the country this whole time on<br/>the down low.")
('Amy', 'What?! Is that true?!')
('Van', "There's more. The guy was biding his time until he<br/>could sneak off with his other lady into the night.<br/>Wanna guess when he finally did?")
('Van', "A month ago. If you don't believe me, you can ask his<br/>friend Simon. He'll fill you in on what he knows.")
('Amy', "Simon...? I've heard him mention that name before.")
('Amy', '...')
('Amy', 'So he was cheating on me... I always doubted it, but<br/>part of me had wondered deep down if that was<br/>the case.')
('Amy', 'Having it confirmed like this is...a lot.')
('Amy', "*sniffle* *sniffle*... I'm sorry. I feel awful. I shouldn't<br/>be crying in front of you two.")
('Agnès', "That's okay. I'm sure it's a difficult thing to process<br/>right now. You can cry if you need to.")
('Agnès', "(It's hard to watch her like this, but if it's for her own<br/>good, I guess it's the best choice we could<br/>have made...)")
('Feri', "(It's so tough to know what the best thing to do for<br/>her in this situation is...)")
('Aaron', '(Sure feels like a dick move pulling this on someone<br/>who came to us wanting to know the truth, if you<br/>ask me.)')
('Amy', "I'm...sorry you had to see all that. I'm okay now.")
('Amy', "I know you're probably going to roll your eyes at what<br/>I'm about to say, but...")
('Amy', "...I still can't fully convince myself that Mark would<br/>go out and cheat on me.")
('Amy', "I can't stop thinking he MUST have had some sort of<br/>reason he had to disappear on me. It's the only thing<br/>that makes sense.")
('Amy', "Haha... I feel embarrassed even saying that out loud.<br/>I must sound totally delusional right now, like I'm just<br/>trying to run away from the truth.")
('Van', "Hey, nothin' wrong with a little healthy skepticism.")
('Van', "Can't exactly say our investigation's as complete as<br/>we'd like without being able to reach him and get his<br/>side of the story, either. I get it.")
('Amy', "You're sweet to say that. Thank you.")
('Amy', "Anyway, I think I'm going to leave now.<br/>Thanks again, both of you. Take care.")
('System', 'Quest A Lost Lover completed!')
('System', 'Received')
('Van', "(The clue we got mentions an 'ever-resourceful guide<br/>of the theater.')")
('Van', "(If I had to guess, it's probably talkin' about this guide<br/>who works at Esprit Cinema. One way to find out.)")
('Van', "Got a second? We're taking part in this riddle game<br/>that's being tested right now.")
('Van', "You the 'ever-resourceful guide of the theater' that's<br/>got the last key we're looking for, by any chance?")
('Guide Hendrick', 'Unbelievable! To think someone has reached the likes<br/>of me at long last!')
('Guide Hendrick', 'Yes, what you say is true. I serve the Kingdom of<br/>Edith as a humble member of this<br/>theatrical company.')
('Guide Hendrick', 'Long have I awaited the arrival of one who would<br/>come for my key, and it seems as though that time is<br/>finally upon me!')
('Van', "You've been waitin' for us, huh? That's a new one.<br/>That's not what your pals said. You different from<br/>them somehow?")
('Guide Hendrick', 'That I am. As it so happens, I was once part of the<br/>knights brigade.')
('Guide Hendrick', 'Circumstances have since seen me in the employ of<br/>this troupe. However, my loyalty to the Edith<br/>royal family remains as unwavering as ever.')
('Guide Hendrick', "Indeed, 'pon catching wind of a plot by a certain<br/>count to imprison the princess, I saw fit to<br/>infiltrate the enemy's ranks.")
('Guide Hendrick', "I lack the means to stop the count's schemes. That is<br/>why I have sought someone to whom I could entrust<br/>my key—and at last, they have arrived!")
('Agnès', "Well, then... This story's getting a little dramatic.")
('Feri', "Holy cow! There's a spy involved, too?<br/>That's awesome!")
('Aaron', "Didn't expect there to be any espionage involved in<br/>this whole scavenger hunt. There's more to the plot of<br/>this thing than I expected.")
('Guide Hendrick', 'And with that, I shall now leave the last key in your<br/>capable hands.')
('System', 'Obtained the last key.')
('Van', "Thanks. You won't regret it.")
('Van', "From the way you're talkin', it sounds like you know<br/>who's behind all of this. Care to fill us in?")
('Guide Hendrick', 'Certainly. The man who imprisoned our fair princess<br/>is none other than Count Iota.')
('Guide Hendrick', 'He is a vile man who oppressed the people of his<br/>dominion—thus the royal family saw fit to punish him<br/>for his misdeeds.')
('Guide Hendrick', "As a result, the count came to harbor a profound<br/>grudge against them, which has led to today's tragic<br/>state of affairs.")
('Van', "Got'cha. I guess that'd do it.")
('Guide Hendrick', "But fear not! Justice is on our side, for the count's<br/>own butler, Ilhan, is of the same mind as myself.")
('Guide Hendrick', 'Give unto him the three keys that you have<br/>assembled, and he shall be able to free the princess at<br/>long last!')
('Guide Hendrick', 'Good luck! The fate of Her Royal Highness now rests<br/>within your hands! Please, do not let the<br/>kingdom down!')
('Agnès', "We won't! I swear to you!")
('Agnès', '...Whoops. I got into the moment more than I<br/>expected there. That almost felt real.')
('Van', "Guess that's what happens when we're dealin' with an<br/>actor who goes method.")
('Feri', "Leave it to us! We'll get the keys to that butler if it's<br/>the last thing we do!")
('Van', "Huh. Someone's gettin' pretty into this. Havin'<br/>fun, kiddo?")
('Feri', 'Heehee! Yeah, I guess I got a little caught up in what<br/>was happening.')
('Aaron', "Oh, but don't you worry. We'll rescue your<br/>fair princess. I don't mind putting in the work.")
('Aaron', "'Cause once she's free, she can repay me with a<br/>healthy dose of happily ever afters for the rest of<br/>our days.")
('Van', "You just had to turn this into a cheap porno,<br/>didn't you?")
('Van', "Anyway, looks like our next stop is this Count Iota's<br/>manor, wherever that might be.")
('Van', "Iota and Ilhan... I've heard those names<br/>somewhere before...")
('Agnès', "There might not be a riddle attached to this key, but<br/>it sounds like we'll have to go searching for one<br/>more place.")
('Agnès', "Isn't there a café in town with the name 'Iota'?")
('Feri', "There might not be a riddle this time, but it looks like<br/>we've got one more place to find.")
('Feri', "Hmm... I feel like I've seen the name 'Iota' on a<br/>building in town before.")
('Aaron', "There's no riddle this time, but guess we've gotta put<br/>on our thinking caps and hustle one last time.")
('Aaron', "Isn't there some place in town called 'Iota'?")
('Van', "I'm sure we'll run into it if we walk around<br/>long enough. Let's roll.")
('Van', 'Hey there, Chief.')
('Van', "Got an assignment right now I was hopin' we could<br/>talk to you about if you got a minute.")
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', 'Van Arkride. We meet again.')
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', "You know any good reporter doesn't give up her<br/>scoops without a good reason. Tell me what brings<br/>you here and we'll take it from there.")
('Van', "Oh, I think you'll be pretty interested in this one.<br/>It's gotta do with a terrorism case from a couple<br/>decades ago I'm told you know about. You see...")
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', "I see someone's done their homework.<br/>Definitely earning your keep on this assignment of<br/>yours, I see.")
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', "All right, I'll bite. I'll tell you what I know.")
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', "But in exchange, you have to promise to report back<br/>on how everything turns out once it's over. Deal?")
('Van', "Why? Thinkin' of turning this into an article<br/>or something?")
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', "More or less. Certainly has the makings for a story<br/>worth bringing to light. If it turns out I'm wrong,<br/>no problem. I'll keep it to myself.")
('Van', 'Works for me. You got yourself a deal.')
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', "So as it happens, I'm still investigating that case, even<br/>if it's never been made public.")
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', "Partly it's to bring justice for the surviving family, but<br/>also to keep the pressure on anti-immigrant groups<br/>that would do such a thing.")
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', "Suffice it to say, I'm well aware of what Roderick's up<br/>to these days.")
('Agnès', 'You are? What is he doing now?')
('Feri', 'You are? What is he doing?')
('Aaron', 'Good to know. Now quit beating around the bush<br/>and spit it out.')
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', 'Once he grew up, Roderick became a young<br/>entrepreneur—and a promising one, at that.')
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', 'He travels around cutting business deals, but he keeps<br/>Edith as his home base.')
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', "I've interviewed him on a number of occasions over<br/>the years. Not just as a survivor of that case, but also<br/>to discuss his business ventures.")
('Van', "Sounds like an impressive guy. Must've inherited his<br/>dad's ambition to make a difference.")
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', 'I can try to call him on his mobile terminal and<br/>arrange a meeting for you, if you like.')
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', "I can't make any promises, but do you want me to try?")
('Van', "Sure. I'd appreciate it.")
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', 'Hi, Roderick. How are you? This is editor-in-chief<br/>Sullivan from the Tyrell Times. I wanted to ask...')
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', "You're all set!")
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', 'Luckily for you, he just so happens to be nearby.<br/>He said he would wait for you later at the terrace over<br/>by the station.')
('Van', 'Awesome. That worked out perfect, then.')
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', "There's more. There's something else he was hoping<br/>you two could do for him in return.")
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', 'He wants you to bring your client—the owner of the<br/>locket—with you when you meet him.')
('Agnès', 'He wants to meet Bruno?')
('Agnès', "I suppose that's a perfectly reasonable thing to ask...<br/>though I don't know if he'll agree to it. Hmm...")
('Feri', "Uh, I guess I can see why he'd wanna meet him.")
('Feri', 'But I dunno if Bruno will be willing to do that...')
('Aaron', "I get why he'd ask that, but I've got my doubts that<br/>grandpa's gonna play ball.")
('Van', "We won't know for sure until we ask him. We'll bring<br/>it up when we give him our progress report.")
('Editor-in-Chief Sullivan', "Fingers crossed. Good luck, spriggan. Make sure to<br/>come talk to me once everything's over.")
('Van', "Yeah, yeah, I will. A deal's a deal.")
('Van', "All right, let's ring the guy up and get this show on<br/>the road.")
('Van', 'Hey, this is Van Arkride from Arkride Solutions.<br/>I wanted to ask...')
('Van', '...Great. See you then.')
('Agnès', 'What did he say?')
('Feri', 'How did it go?')
('Aaron', "How'd it go?")
('Van', "Didn't say much. For now, we're just linking up at<br/>the Riverside bridge.")
('Van', "We'll fill him in on everything once we meet him<br/>in person.")
('Agnès', "Oh, okay. Well, I'm ready when you are.")
('Feri', "Okay! Sounds good to me. Let's go!")
('Aaron', "Fair enough. Let's move.")
('Van', "Hi there. I'm a private investigator working on a case<br/>with my assistants here.")
('Van', "We're lookin' into a couple of people for one of our<br/>clients at the moment.")
('Van', "Have you had a rich-lookin' girl stop by your stall, by<br/>any chance? She would've had a young guy with<br/>her—somethin' of a delinquent.")
('Nami', 'Oh, yes! I know exactly who you must be<br/>talking about!')
('Nami', 'They looked like the oddest pair together, so they<br/>stuck out like a sore thumb.')
('Agnès', "That's great! Could you tell us more about them?<br/>Do you remember what they were talking about?<br/>What was your impression of them?")
('Nami', 'Hmm... Let me think...')
('Nami', 'For two people who seemed about as different as you<br/>could get, they were getting along unusually well.<br/>Like they were pretty good friends.')
('Nami', 'The guy looked like a bit of a rough character, but he<br/>was telling her all kinds of things about the<br/>Tyrell District.')
('Nami', 'As for the girl, she seemed pretty worried about her<br/>relationship with her dad.')
('Nami', 'He was being pretty sweet and trying to give her<br/>advice, from what I could hear.')
('Agnès', "That's interesting. So she was talking about<br/>her family.")
('Agnès', "Judging by what Rumsfeld told us, it definitely<br/>sounded like she and her father weren't all that close.")
('Agnès', "Maybe that's been bothering her.")
('Van', 'Could you tell us a bit more about the guy?<br/>Anything that stuck out about him? Every little<br/>detail helps.')
('Nami', "Hmm... He didn't seem all that remarkable to me, so<br/>it's hard to know what to say.")
('Nami', 'But he did seem surprisingly naïve for a guy who<br/>otherwise looked like a troublemaker, I can tell you<br/>that much.')
('Nami', 'I think I also heard him mention that his mom runs a<br/>general store over in Old Town.')
('Van', "Did you say general store? Heh, of all the people it<br/>could've been, it had to be him, huh? Wild.")
('Risette', 'What do you mean, Mr. Arkride? Is that to say you<br/>might know the identity of the young man<br/>in question?')
('Van', "Yeah, you could say that. Think about it: Old Town,<br/>general store, deadbeat son. There's only one guy I<br/>can think of who ticks all the boxes.")
('Van', "I'm talkin' about Eddy, the son of the lady who runs<br/>Newberry General Store.")
('Agnès', 'Oh, now I get it! You must be right!')
('Agnès', "I've heard rumors before that he likes to go out<br/>partying at night.")
('Van', "We still don't know how the hell a guy like him<br/>wound up meeting such a rich girl, though.")
('Van', "There's gotta be more to this story still. We need to<br/>find more info.")
('Nami', "If you're looking for someone else to talk to, why<br/>don't you try McMillan Café?")
('Nami', "I've seen the two of them talking out on the terrace<br/>before a handful of times. Someone there might<br/>know something.")
('Risette', "I see. Thank you for the information. We'll be sure to<br/>look into it.")
('Van', "Hi there. I'm a private investigator workin' on a case<br/>with my assistants here.")
('Van', "We're lookin' into a couple of people for one of our<br/>clients at the moment.")
('Van', "You see any young, rich girls hangin' out with a<br/>rough-around-the-edges guy around here recently?")
('Van', "Doesn't have to be a big lead or nothin'.<br/>Whatever you know, we'd appreciate if you shared it<br/>with us.")
('Giselle', "Oooh! A private investigator, huh? That's a neat job<br/>you have.")
('Giselle', "You wouldn't happen to be that famous spriggan<br/>everyone likes to talk about in these parts, would you?")
('Van', "Spriggan? Sorry, I've got no idea what you're<br/>talking about.")
('Van', "Not to be rude, but we're pressed for time. We know<br/>those two have been to this café and we're lookin' to<br/>find someone who can tell us more.")
('Giselle', 'Heehee. Sorry if I offended you! Just not every day I<br/>get to talk to people like you.')
('Giselle', "Anyway, I definitely know who you're talking about.<br/>I've seen those two people sitting at that table over<br/>there a lot lately.")
('Giselle', "They get up to some pretty interesting conversations.<br/>I know it's rude, but I can't help but listen in on<br/>them, you know?")
('Risette', "May we ask what they've discussed in<br/>those conversations?")
('Giselle', 'Well, earlier, the girl was asking him all sorts of<br/>things about kidnapping.')
('Giselle', 'Like what sort of cases have there been before, what<br/>goes into kidnapping someone, stuff like that.')
('Giselle', 'He had this serious expression on his face, but she<br/>looked happy and excited for some reason.')
('Giselle', "*sigh* If only she'd thought to ask me. I'm an expert<br/>in that sort of thing. I could've told her everything she<br/>wanted to know and then some.")
('Agnès', 'Uhh...')
('Risette', 'This woman appears to have some very...<br/>peculiar interests.')
('Feri', "That's so weird. Why would she wanna talk<br/>about kidnapping? She must've had some sort<br/>of reason...")
('Feri', 'Wait! Could it have something to do with this case?')
('Aaron', "Man, this girl we're after must have a weird idea<br/>of fun. Who goes around talking about kidnapping<br/>and shit in public, huh?")
('Aaron', "But hey, we definitely know what's going on here,<br/>don't you agree?")
('Van', "Yeah—although we still don't have enough proof yet<br/>to be sure.")
('Giselle', "Err, I don't know what you guys are going on about,<br/>but it sounds like you were able to figure<br/>something out? Glad I was able to help.")
('Giselle', "Oh! One more thing: that guy seems to run with a<br/>pretty tough crowd. You'd better be careful if you're<br/>going to keep investigating him.")
('Agnès', 'Huh? What sort of people are you talking about?')
('Giselle', 'From what I overheard, he belongs to Desire.')
('Giselle', "They're a nasty gang. Fighting, stealing,<br/>blackmailing... You name it, they've done it<br/>and more.")
('Giselle', "Those people aren't above doing anything.<br/>Whatever it takes to get what they want, they'll do it<br/>without blinking an eye.")
('Giselle', "I don't think that guy understands what he's gotten<br/>himself into. He seems to believe they have more<br/>honors and morals than they really do.")
('Giselle', "The girl didn't seem to know any better, either, and<br/>just went along with what he had to say.")
('Van', "We've talked to him before in the past. His name's<br/>Eddy, and that was more-or-less the impression he<br/>gave me, yeah.")
('Van', "It didn't sound like he was trying to pull the wool<br/>over her eyes or anything like that, then?")
('Giselle', "Not at all. I've read a lot of criminal profiles, so trust<br/>me, I'd be able to recognize it if he was lying to her.")
('Giselle', "He really does seem to think Desire's made up of<br/>good people.")
('Giselle', "That makes me think they might just be using him<br/>for all he's worth if his outlook toward them is<br/>that rosy.")
('Giselle', "That's what I wanted to warn you about. It's not him<br/>you need to be concerned about—it's the people he<br/>works with that could be a problem.")
('Van', "Right. It's entirely possible Eddy's being put up to<br/>something without realizing it.")
('Van', "Fair enough. Guess that means we can't rule out the<br/>possibility that Eddy's being played for a fool in<br/>this situation.")
('Van', "Thanks for the tip. You've given us a lot to<br/>work with.")
('Risette', 'Now that we know all of that, where should we<br/>go next?')
('Van', "I think we've got a good handle of what's probably<br/>going on here. Now we just need to confirm our<br/>findings and go from there.")
('Van', "For now, we should figure out what's been going on<br/>with Eddy. Time to take a trip to Newberry in<br/>Old Town.")
('Van', 'You must be the idol that put in that request.<br/>Seyla, right? Nice to meet you.')
('Seyla', 'Oh, wow! So the rumors really are true, huh?')
('Seyla', "If you're here, does that mean you're willing to hear<br/>me out?")
('Van', "Yeah. Probably best not to just stand around talkin'<br/>like this, though. Why don't we grab a seat and take<br/>it from there?")
('Van', 'You mentioned that you were supposed to be putting<br/>on a street performance tonight.')
('Van', "But it sounds like your partner didn't show up when<br/>she was supposed to?")
('Seyla', "Yes, that's right. Lulua did mention to me that she<br/>had work today.")
('Seyla', 'But she said she would be done after sunset, so we<br/>planned to meet up here directly once she got off<br/>her job.')
('Seyla', "It was getting later and later and she was nowhere to<br/>be seen. Once an hour passed and I still hadn't heard<br/>from her, I decided to visit her place.")
('Van', 'Makes sense to me. Sounds like a pretty reasonable<br/>thing to do.')
('Seyla', "Mm-hmm. When I got there, I knocked on the door<br/>but didn't get an answer.")
('Seyla', 'I have a key to her apartment that she lent me, so I<br/>used it to poke my head inside and found a note she<br/>left on the table.')
('Seyla', "Reading that note left me so concerned, so that's<br/>when I contacted you so you could hopefully look<br/>for her.")
('Van', 'Makes sense. What was written on the note?')
('Seyla', 'There were only two things scribbled down on it.')
('Seyla', "One was a name I didn't recognize, Clément—and<br/>then other thing was 'Part-time, 1,000 mira/hour.'")
('Van', "A thousand mira per hour? That's what we charge as<br/>our base rate at my agency.")
('Van', "That's pretty damn good for some side hustle.<br/>Some might say even too good. Practically screams<br/>somethin' not on the up-and-up, if you ask me.")
('Seyla', 'You think so, too, huh? I figured that was a<br/>distinct possibility.')
('Van', '(That case we solved this morning was another<br/>instance of someone getting caught up in sketchy<br/>part-time work.)')
('Van', "(It's entirely possible this might be<br/>connected somehow.)")
('Van', "(That name, Clément... He's got himself involved in<br/>all kinds of stuff, doesn't he?)")
('Van', '(Definitely a sign that Lulua is another victim of<br/>whatever he and his people are scheming.)')
('Seyla', 'The thing about Lulua is, she comes from<br/>the countryside.')
('Seyla', "She's a really honest girl at heart and tends to take<br/>people at their word...for better and for worse.")
('Seyla', "That's why I'm really worried about her. I'm scared<br/>what she might've gotten herself into.")
('Van', "I can understand why. At this point, you've given me<br/>everything I need to know. From what you've told<br/>me, this is definitely a job for a spriggan.")
('Van', "Seein' as it's so urgent and all, I'll go ahead and get to<br/>work immediately.")
('Seyla', "Oh, thank you so much! I'm so glad you're able to<br/>help me!")
('Van', "Don't mention it. Tell me a little more about Lulua.<br/>Has she been acting strange in any particular<br/>way lately?")
('Seyla', "Actually, yes, now that you ask. I've been seeing her<br/>spending time with an elderly woman who looks<br/>pretty well off.")
('Seyla', "When I asked her about it, she said she was escorting<br/>her as part of some volunteer work she's doing.")
('Seyla', 'That was news to me, the fact she was doing anything<br/>like that. It felt really strange to me.')
('Seyla', "I mean, it's nice of her to want to help and all, but I<br/>know for a fact that she really shouldn't have the time<br/>to spare for that right now.")
('Seyla', "That's because we're both trying to save up our money<br/>so we can put on our dream concert. We're busy as it<br/>is just working on that.")
('Van', 'Which is probably where that thousand mira per hour<br/>comes in.')
('Van', "She could be earnin' that much from that Clément<br/>person as compensation for helping.")
('Seyla', 'That was my hunch, too.')
('Seyla', "I don't know the name of the woman that Lulua's<br/>been looking after or else I'd be more than happy to<br/>tell you.")
('Seyla', 'But she did say the other day that the woman bought<br/>her clothes at Jardin Boutique in the department store<br/>by the station.')
('Seyla', 'Does that help you at all?')
('Van', "Oh, yeah—that's a good jumping off point for me to<br/>start lookin' for her.")
('Van', "Once we're done talking, I'll make my way straight to<br/>that boutique and have a talk with whoever I<br/>find there.")
('Van', 'As for you, I think you should stay here for the<br/>time being.')
('Van', "I know it's well past when you two were supposed to<br/>meet, but it's always possible that she could just be<br/>runnin' late and still show up.")
('Seyla', "Right, that is true. Okay, I'll do that. Thanks again!")
('System', 'Van hurried over to Jardin Boutique without delay to<br/>begin looking for Lulua.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Oh! Hey, guys! Good to see you again.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Need something with the paper?')
('Agnès', 'Not this time. We came here to talk to you, Marielle.')
('Van', "I'll give it to you straight: we're working' on a 4SPG<br/>involving Dingo and need your help.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'What?! You are?!')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'What sort of request is it? Please, tell me!')
('Feri', 'Uhh, to put it simply...')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "You talked to Meld's editor-in-chief, Mr. Cunning?")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Dingo told me about him before, but I've never had<br/>the chance to meet him in person.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "He said he wants you to find Dingo's notebook?")
('Van', "That's right. Do you remember Dingo ever talking to<br/>you about that thing, by any chance?")
('Van', "Doesn't have to be anything direct or explicit.<br/>Anything you happen to remember him sayin'<br/>will help.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Actually, we didn't just talk about it before.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "I've seen that notebook with my own eyes.")
('Aaron', 'Say what?!')
('Agnès', 'H-How did that happen?!')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Err, as I'm sure you all noticed, when he was alive, I<br/>tended to barge in on him while he was trying to<br/>work and stuff.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'One day while we were having lunch, I was asking for<br/>advice on how to interview people and he was writing<br/>stuff in this black leather notebook.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'I asked him what it was since I was curious.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "He told me it's where he jots his info down—both for<br/>his reporting work and info broker stuff.")
('Judith', "That definitely sounds like what we're after.")
('Risette', 'That certainly sounds like the right notebook.')
('Quatre', "That certainly sounds like what we're looking for.")
('Bergard', "At least now we know it's real.")
('Quatre', "At least now we can confirm that it's real.")
('Risette', "If nothing else, at least we can now confirm that<br/>it's real.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'I got a little whiny and tried to get him to show me<br/>his notes, but of course, he refused.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'When I got huffy about it, he kind of laughed and<br/>patted me on the head. I still remember exactly what<br/>he said.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "'Who knows? Maybe you'll get a peek at them one of<br/>these days. Although if I play my cards right, you<br/>shouldn't ever have to.'")
('Feri', 'Oh, wow...')
('Agnès', "He must've already been preparing for what might<br/>happen to him in that case...")
('Van', '...')
('Van', "If that's the way he was talkin', then we can probably<br/>rule out him takin' the notebook with him to Creil.")
('Van', "The CID also apparently swept through his place and<br/>couldn't find any real material of note that he left<br/>there, either.")
('Van', "He had to've either given it to someone else to hang<br/>on to, or stashed it somewhere for safekeeping.")
('Van', "Which brings me to my next question: can you think<br/>of anyone he would've left that notebook with,<br/>or anyone who might know where it would be?")
('Van', "Again, it's okay if you don't know anything definitive.<br/>Any leads you might have would be great.")
('Van', "And just to be clear, I don't mean other brokers<br/>like Bermotti. I'm talkin' about other sorts of<br/>acquaintances he had.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Right, of course. Hmm... Let me think. Based on<br/>what Mr. Cunning told you...')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Wait. Could he have...?')
('Van', 'You think of something?')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Maybe. I could be completely wrong, but I can't rule<br/>it out, either.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Basically, when Dingo was alive, he would sometimes<br/>cover...uh...the adult industry for Meld Magazine.')
('Agnès', "H-He did? That's...interesting.<br/>(I guess that comes with being a tabloid reporter.)")
('Feri', "What's the adult industry? Doesn't every industry<br/>have adults in it?")
('Aaron', "It's code for grownup stuff. Certainly more grown up<br/>than his wannabe protégé here, that's for sure.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Grr! ANYWAY, one time I confronted him about it.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Do... Do you really have to cover such sexual stuff in<br/>your articles?!')
('Dingo', "If readers demand it, it's our job as reporters to give<br/>them what they want. Plain and simple.")
('Dingo', "Plus it's a way to get information that can help shut<br/>down some of the nastier illegal places run by<br/>the mafia.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'O-Oh, okay. I guess that makes sense.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', '...Say, out of curiosity, do you ever...visit those sorts<br/>of places yourself?')
('Dingo', 'Huh? Only when I need to for work.')
('Dingo', "Lately, I've been too busy to go to any places like that<br/>myself, so I've had to lean on one of my old contacts a<br/>lot to get what I need.")
('Dingo', 'Not exactly ideal when my job is supposed to be to<br/>report on things I see myself, but it is what it is.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "F-Fair enough, I guess.<br/>You sure won't hear me complaining about you—")
('Dingo', 'Complaining about what?')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Nothing! Nothing at all! ...Anyway, who's this<br/>contact you mentioned?")
('Dingo', "Her? She's a woman who operates underground—<br/>runs a handful of outlets. Pretty talented, all<br/>things considered.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "'She'?! Your contact is a WOMAN?!")
('Dingo', 'Yeah? Why does that matter?')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', '...Mmgh...!')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "You've got to introduce me to her! It'll... It'll help me<br/>write better news articles! Yeah!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Unfortunately, Dingo said it was too soon for me to<br/>be going to a place like that, and that was that.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Looking back on it, there's only one part of town he<br/>could've meant when he said she worked<br/>underground, huh?")
('Aaron', 'Yeah. I think that one goes without saying.')
('Van', "Not only that, I think I just might know the woman<br/>he's talkin' about.")
('Van', "Never would've guessed those two had any history,<br/>but just goes to show it's a small world we live in.")
('Agnès', 'Uhh...<br/>(I certainly remember there being a business that fit<br/>the bill when we were down there.)')
('Feri', "Does that mean we're going to the<br/>Blacklight District?")
('Van', "Yeah. Who knows if we'll turn anything up down<br/>there, but it's worth a shot.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'H-Hey, you guys?')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'I want to go with you! Could I? Please?')
('Van', "I don't know...")
('Feri', 'Yeah, it gets kind of dangerous in the<br/>Blacklight District.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'Oh, I already know how dangerous it can be—<br/>believe me.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "But we're talking about Dingo's notes here.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "What's inside them matters to me, too, you know.")
('Dingo', "Who knows? Maybe you'll get a peek at them one of<br/>these days.")
('Dingo', "Although if I play my cards right, you shouldn't ever<br/>have to.")
('Agnès', 'She does have a point. What do you think, Van?')
('Van', "...All right. You can come. You did give us some<br/>valuable info, so it's only fair. But you gotta promise<br/>two things:")
('Van', "One, you'll stay behind us down there. No<br/>running ahead. And two, you'll carry your own weight<br/>and help us out, too. Deal?")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Deal! Thanks, Van! I promise, you won't regret this!")
('System', 'Marielle has temporarily joined the group.')
('Van', "(Hmm... I don't see anyone who looks like they could<br/>be Curtis. I'll hit up the manager and see what she<br/>has to say.)")
('Van', 'Excuse me. Does the name Curtis ring a bell, by<br/>any chance?')
('System', "Van explained the request he and the others received<br/>from Curtis' mother.")
('System', 'They also explained his stark change in personality.')
('Manager Giulia', 'Oh, wow... Poor Curtis. I had no idea he was going<br/>through all of that.')
('Manager Giulia', 'He comes here a lot, so one of my workers and I<br/>made a point of looking after him and helping him<br/>with his studies.')
('Manager Giulia', "Unfortunately, I couldn't tell you anything about his<br/>personal life, or those mints you mentioned. That's all<br/>news to me, too.")
('Agnès', "That's okay. We appreciate you talking to us at all.<br/>If you don't mind me asking, could you tell us about<br/>the other worker?")
('Manager Giulia', "Oh, I recognize you! You come here a lot, too.<br/>You're from Aramis, aren't you?")
('Manager Giulia', 'His name is Albert. You probably know him, right?')
('Agnès', "Yes, absolutely! I can't believe I forgot that this is<br/>where he works.")
('Manager Giulia', 'He sure does. He and Curtis seemed to get along<br/>really well. He would recommend reference books for<br/>Curtis to buy and whatnot.')
('Manager Giulia', 'Between the two of us, I imagine Albert would know<br/>more about him than I do.')
('Aaron', "Fat load of good that'll do unless we can track the<br/>nerd down. Any ideas where he might be?")
('Agnès', "Hmm... At this hour, he's probably either on campus<br/>or somewhere around the Auber District.")
('Feri', "Then what are we waiting for? Let's go find him!")
('Van', "That's exactly what we're gonna do. Fingers crossed<br/>he doesn't turn out to be a dead end.")
('Feri', "There he is! That's gotta be the seller, right? He just<br/>looks like it.")
('Van', "Only one way to find out. I'll pose as a customer and<br/>try talking to him.")
('Van', "You guys hang out here. If we approach him as group,<br/>he'll probably get spooked.")
('Agnès', 'Makes sense to me. Good luck, Van!')
('Aaron', "Whoa! Hold on a minute, chief. We're talking about<br/>a guy who deals to kids. He's not gonna wanna sell to<br/>an old fart like you.")
('Van', "*sigh* You'll never miss an opportunity to remind me<br/>that I'm older than you, do you?")
('Van', 'But you might have a point. If his client base is<br/>students like Curtis, then I sure as hell am out.')
('Agnès', "Oh, Van, don't let Aaron get to you. You're still<br/>perfectly young!")
('Feri', "Yeah, don't worry about it! You should be<br/>more confident!")
('Van', "Nah, I agree. I'm not the best man for the job.<br/>It oughta be someone who looks rebellious enough to<br/>enjoy taking drugs, or else our guy won't bite.")
('Van', "You're up, kid. Show this old man what a young punk<br/>like you can deliver.")
('Aaron', "Hell yeah! I'll deliver, all right. Just watch and learn!")
('Aaron', 'Yo, dude. Heard you could hook me up with some<br/>good shit. That true?')
(40301, '...Hmm? Who the hell are you?')
('Aaron', "A good friend of mine told me all about you.<br/>Said you've got some kickass mints that can get you<br/>high—emphasis on the 'kick.'")
('Aaron', "Mind hooking me up with some? I'll pay you<br/>whatever you want if it's that good.")
(40301, "Yeah, I know what you're talking about, man.<br/>That lanky ass schoolkid fill you in?")
(40301, "I'll let you in on a secret: that stuff originally came<br/>straight from some pharmaceutical company.")
(40301, "I hadn't heard of 'em before, but I guess they got<br/>busted by the cops or something like that.")
(40301, 'They were out on the market for only a hot minute<br/>before they were taken off. I just sold the last of my<br/>stock to that kid a little while ago.')
('Aaron', "You kidding me? All that talk and you've got nothing<br/>to deliver? Way to let a guy down.")
(40301, "Hey, trust me—I'd love to have more so I could make<br/>even more money. It is what it is.")
(40301, "Seems like that kid's developed a real dependence on<br/>'em, though.")
(40301, 'I tried telling him what I just told you, but he got all<br/>pissy with me. Told me to give him more before<br/>chucking what he had like a little baby.')
(40301, "Ugh. Stuff like that's why I freaking hate dealing with<br/>addicts like him. They've always gotta make<br/>everything hard.")
('Aaron', '(Bingo. So the kid really did just come through here.)')
('Aaron', "Sounds pretty shitty, yeah. What'd he do after he<br/>threw that temper tantrum?")
(40301, "I suggested some other stuff to try, but he wouldn't<br/>listen to me. All he wants are those mints, it seems.")
(40301, 'So I told him to try the Blacklight District just to<br/>finally get the kid out of my face.')
(40301, "Even told him how to get down there for<br/>good measure. Hopefully he'll leave me alone now.")
('Aaron', "The Blacklight District, huh? That's a good idea.")
('Aaron', '(I could definitely see someone down there hawking<br/>that stuff in some dark and dingy corner.)')
(40301, 'Is that all you were after, too? Just those mints?')
(40301, "I've got plenty of other perfectly good stuff,<br/>you know. I'll even give you a free hit. You should<br/>try it.")
('Aaron', "Nah, I'm good, man. I'm only interested in those<br/>mints, too.")
(40301, 'Great—thanks for nothing. What a waste of time<br/>this was.')
(40301, "Think I'm gonna try selling somewhere else today.<br/>Scene here's deader than a stuffed pom.")
('Van', '...Nice work. Sounds like you got a lot out of<br/>that dirtbag.')
('Agnès', "I'm just glad we have an idea of where Curtis might<br/>be now.")
('Feri', 'I bet we can guess where those mints came from, too.')
('Aaron', 'Yeah. It was probably a dummy corporation set up<br/>by A.')
('Van', 'Now all we need to do is find the kid and hear his<br/>side of the story.')
('Van', "Seein' as he's on his way to the Blacklight District,<br/>let's focus on draggin' him out first. We can question<br/>him after that.")
('Quatre', 'Very well.')
('Risette', 'Shall we be on our way, then?')
('Judith', "Sounds good to me. A place like that's going to be<br/>dangerous for a kid like him before long.")
('Bergard', "Let's track him and get him out of there.")
('Van', '(Oh, right. Those street racers asked me to scout<br/>some people.)')
('Van', "(I know Jack likes him some cars. I'll see if he's up<br/>for it.)")
('Van', "Hey, Jack. Got a sec? I'm doing a job for some street<br/>racers at the moment.")
('Van', "They're looking for some racers to fill out their<br/>lineup for today.")
('Jack', "Oh, yeah? Sounds like a pretty fun gig you've<br/>got there.")
('Halle', "I can see how it'd catch both you boys' attention<br/>for sure.")
('Van', "Anyway, you can probably see where this is going.<br/>You in, Jack? We'd love to have you.")
('Halle', "You should go! You were just talking about how you<br/>haven't gotten to drive as much as you'd like lately.")
('Jack', "Oh, trust me, I got my fill on the drive all the way up<br/>to here. I'm plenty caught up now at this point.")
('Jack', "That being said...knowing the type of people you can<br/>wrangle up, I'm sure it'll be one hell of a fun race.")
('Jack', "I guess I'm in. Not often I get to race against other<br/>people these days.")
('Van', 'Nice. I knew I could count on you. See you at the<br/>meetup point later, then?')
('Jack', 'Sounds good.')
('Van', "Well, I've hit up everyone I can think of.")
('Van', "Guess all that's left is to loop back with the racers.")
('Van', "Well, I've hit up everyone I can think of.")
('Van', "Guess all that's left is to loop back with the racers.")
('Odette', "Hey, Van! We've been waiting for you.")
('Van', "Never thought I'd answer a call from you.")
('Van', "I see the whole Student Council's here. I think I can<br/>guess what you guys want from me.")
('Odette', "Oh! Can you come back after you've seen<br/>the request I sent?")
('Van', '(Fair enough, I guess. Better check the local<br/>bulletin board.)')
('Renne', "Let's get straight to business. Albert, you start.")
('Albert', 'Me? Why do I have to go first?!')
('Albert', "Ahem! ...Anyway, it's about our plans for next month.")
('Albert', "We've decided to put on a small event as Aramis<br/>students to celebrate the upcoming new year.")
('Albert', "We're planning on having a meetup with the children<br/>living in the Auber District.")
('Renne', 'Officially, the school is framing it as a way for us<br/>students to make a contribution to the area.')
('Renne', "But it's also intended to be therapeutic for the kids,<br/>too, seeing as things have been so unusual.")
('Odette', 'One thing we want to do is hand out treats for those<br/>kids to hopefully enjoy.')
('Odette', "And what better way to decide than to round up<br/>what's for sale around town and try them out?")
('Van', "That's where we come in, huh?")
('Odette', 'Yep! When I asked Agnès for her thoughts, she<br/>insisted she wanted to handle it as a work assignment.')
('Odette', 'Which is fine by me. I always wanted to post at least<br/>one 4SPG at some point, heehee.')
('Agnès', "I'm sorry, Van. I couldn't resist offering...")
('Odette', "Of course, we don't expect you to help us for free.")
('Odette', "You're more than welcome to sample any sweets you<br/>decide to bring back to us.")
('Odette', "Pretty great, right? You'll get to eat lots of delicious<br/>sweets, all on the school's mira!")
('Agnès', "Odette, you shouldn't put it like that.")
('Albert', "I mean, where's the lie...?")
('Van', "*sigh* As much as it pains me to admit, I guess there's<br/>no denying that my...weaknesses...are all but public<br/>knowledge at this point.")
('Van', 'Regardless, lucky for you kids, I do have some time to<br/>spare, so...')
('Odette', "We need to figure out what treats we're going to<br/>hand out to the kids when we have our meetup.")
('Odette', 'And what better judge to help us figure that out than<br/>you and your big sweet tooth, Van!')
('Van', "Let me wrap up my patrol around town first. I've still<br/>got some spots I need to check out.")
('Van', "Once I know everything's okay, I'll come back here<br/>and then we can get started. Sound good?")
('Odette', "Absolutely! Take your time. We'll be here waiting<br/>for you.")
('Van', "Agnès has been such a good assistant at work. I don't<br/>mind helping her friends out as a favor.")
('Odette', "Wonderful! That's great to hear! Thank you so<br/>much, Van!")
('Van', "I don't know how much help I'll really be, but I'll see<br/>what I can do.")
('Renne', 'Oh, hush. You know as well as the rest of us that your<br/>knowledge and passion for these things is<br/>practically unmatched.')
('Renne', "Just go around to different outlets and bring back<br/>some samples that look good to you. That's not too<br/>much to ask for a connoisseur like you, is it?")
('Van', "You're one of the ones putting on that whole event.<br/>Shouldn't you tag along?")
('Odette', "I'd love to, I really would, but I need to hammer out<br/>some other details with Renne and Albert here, so I'll<br/>have to stay behind.")
('Odette', "I'll leave it up to Agnès to assist you in choosing.<br/>I know she won't steer us wrong!")
('Van', "Well, I suppose that settles it. You okay pitchin'<br/>in, Agnès?")
('Agnès', "S-Sure, I don't mind! I'd be happy to join you.")
('Agnès', 'Besides, we can use this time to keep patrolling<br/>around town.')
('Van', "All right—I'll come fetch you again once we find a<br/>good stopping point on our end.")
('Feri', "I promise we'll make it quick! We'll get our errands<br/>done as fast as we can so you're not waiting long!")
('Aaron', "Eh, I doubt it's gonna take that much time<br/>either way.")
('Risette', "We'll do our absolute best to finish our errands in a<br/>timely manner.")
('Quatre', "I can't imagine they'll take that long anyway.")
('Judith', "We'll be done with everything in a flash, don't worry.")
('Bergard', "We shouldn't be long at all.")
('Agnès', "Okay. I'll be waiting here in the meantime!")
('Van', 'Now to figure out which shops we oughta visit.<br/>Let me think...')
('Van', 'Off the top of my head, there are two spots in Tyrell<br/>we should hit up.')
('Van', 'Beyond that, Old Town, Station Street, and Auber<br/>each have an outlet also worth visiting, so five<br/>places total.')
('Odette', "Great! I knew you'd have no problem coming up with<br/>places to check! I can't wait to see what amazing stuff<br/>you bring back to us!")
('Albert', '...What she said. Good luck, I guess.')
('Albert', 'Stay safe out there, Agnès.')
('Agnès', 'Thanks, Albert. See you guys soon!')
('System', 'Quest For the Kids started!')
('System', 'It is only possible to begin the For the Kids quest<br/>after making Agnès the accompanying character.')
('Van', "(Whoops. Can't forget to bring Agnès before I hit<br/>this place up.)")
('Porco', "Yeah, I've got just the thing for you!")
('Porco', "It's my latest item: mini churros! I'm debuting them<br/>here at the Revolution Festival.")
('Van', 'Mini churros? What makes yours so special?')
('Porco', "Everybody likes a good churro, right? They're tougher<br/>than donuts, crispier, and have that sweetness that<br/>just floods your mouth with every bite!")
('Porco', "Adults can eat 'em just fine, but a lot of kids can't<br/>finish them in one go.")
('Porco', "I thought about what I could do to solve that problem<br/>and that's how my miniature ones were born!")
('Porco', 'After all, nobody should have to miss out on having a<br/>churro if they want one. Now they can have them in<br/>just the size they want!')
('Van', "That's very noble of you, wantin' to spread the joy of<br/>churros however you can. I applaud your effort.")
('Agnès', 'They, erm, do sound like they could be a hit with the<br/>kids, at least.')
('Agnès', "Let's pick some up and bring them back to the others<br/>to consider.")
('Van', "Okay, we've visited all the stores we planned on.")
('Agnès', "We've also got plenty of things to try! Shall we head<br/>back to Odette?")
('Van', "(Whoops. Can't forget to bring Agnès before I hit<br/>this place up.)")
('Kaohan', "Hmm... They're not really meant for kids, but would<br/>you consider offering them some mooncakes?")
('Kaohan', "They're pretty small and easy to eat. Plus I imagine<br/>they'd enjoy the red bean filling since it's sweet.")
('Van', "Mooncakes DO have this sublime sweetness to 'em<br/>that goes perfectly with Eastern tea.")
('Van', "A lot of people even buy them as gifts, don't they?")
('Kaohan', "That's right! They certainly make for good business.")
('Kaohan', "In fact, there's a custom in the East where people will<br/>get together with family and close friends and admire<br/>the moon as they eat them.")
('Kaohan', "Not that there's any one wrong or right way to enjoy<br/>them, of course.")
('Agnès', "That's neat! So they could even serve as an<br/>opportunity for the kids to learn about<br/>another culture.")
('Agnès', "We'd love to buy some so we can taste test them.")
('Van', "Okay, we've visited all the stores we planned on.")
('Agnès', "We've also got plenty of things to try! Shall we head<br/>back to Odette?")
('Odette', "Oh, great! You're back! Thanks for going to all<br/>that trouble.")
('Renne', "Judging from the bags you brought, it looks like<br/>you've brought quite a bit back for us to try.")
('Agnès', 'Mm-hmm! We had a lot of good luck. Van was on<br/>cloud nine the whole time.')
('Van', "Why wouldn't I be? You tell me I get to indulge in<br/>some quality sweets on the job completely for free?<br/>COURSE I'm gonna be all about that.")
('Albert', "Hmph. Well, I'm glad somebody had fun.")
('Odette', "Now, now, Albert. We're his clients! That's not how<br/>we should act.")
('Odette', "Anyway, enough talking! Let's dig into those samples<br/>and see if they're up to snuff!")
('Odette', "You're more than welcome to have some, too, Feri!")
('Feri', "Really? I'd love to!")
('Odette', "You're more than welcome to have some, too, Aaron!")
('Aaron', "Oh, sure. I guess I'll have some.")
('Odette', "You're more than welcome to have some, too, Risette!")
('Risette', 'It would be my pleasure.')
('Odette', "You're more than welcome to have some, too, Quatre!")
('Quatre', 'Are you sure? A-All right, if you insist.')
('Odette', "You're more than welcome to have some, too, Judith!")
('Judith', "You don't have to tell me twice!")
('Odette', "You're more than welcome to have some, too, mister!")
('Bergard', 'Gladly, then.')
('System', "With the manager's permission, the group retrieved<br/>the samples from the bags and got to eating the ones<br/>that suited their fancy.")
('Renne', "Mmm! They're all fantastic. Any one of them would<br/>make for a perfect morning tea snack.")
('Van', '*munch* *munch*')
('Agnès', "I know... It's so hard to choose which to go with.")
('Albert', 'What do you think, Odette? Have any preferences?')
('Odette', 'Hmm? Fawrry, giff ee a hec.<br/>(Sorry, give me a sec.)')
('Albert', "Don't talk with your mouth full! You come from a<br/>decent family, don't you?")
('Odette', 'Ahh... That was like a spa day for my taste buds!')
('Odette', 'I was totally right to bring you in, Van! Your insight<br/>into these things is crazy good.')
('Odette', 'When it comes to both looks and taste, really, I think<br/>the kids will be completely happy with most any<br/>of them. So...')
('Odette', "...why limit ourselves to just one kind of treat?<br/>Let's bring them a bunch!")
('Agnès', "Oh, that's a great idea! Then they could enjoy mixing<br/>and matching different ones together.")
('Albert', "We could even pack them inside different bags so<br/>they won't know what they get until they open it—<br/>kind of like a lottery. That could be fun.")
('Van', "You kids sound pretty pumped up about this already.<br/>New Year's is still a bit of a way's off, you know.")
('Renne', 'Naturally. Planning events is just as fun as putting on<br/>the actual events themselves.')
('Renne', "This was a fantastic idea, Odette. I'm glad you<br/>suggested it.")
('Odette', "Thank you! We'll have to think carefully about<br/>which ones to actually buy and how much.")
('Odette', 'And I guess we need to talk to the treasurer to make<br/>sure we budget things carefully.')
('Albert', 'True. Plus we should also work on figuring out how<br/>many people are going to be taking part in the event<br/>in the first place.')
('Agnès', "Actually, speaking of which, why don't you join us<br/>during the actual meetup, Van?")
('Agnès', "I'd feel terrible pushing you off to the side without an<br/>invitation after all your hard work.")
('Van', "I dunno about that. I might've gone to Aramis, but<br/>you don't think a grown man like me's gonna stick<br/>out at somethin' like that?")
('Albert', "E-Exactly! It's supposed to be put on by us students.<br/>Having him around will ruin that.")
('Renne', "I know what you could do! Let's put you in a big old<br/>costume and parade you in front of the kids!")
('Van', "I'm saying I DON'T want to stick out, you<br/>little gremlin.")
('Odette', "Aww! I can just picture the kids swarming Van!<br/>That'd be so cute!")
('Odette', "Doesn't that sound like fun, Agnès? I'm not the only<br/>one who'd love to see that, am I?")
('Agnès', 'Huh? Umm... Sure. That could be nice.')
('Renne', 'Well, we have a majority. In the suit you go, Van.')
('Albert', "(Hrm... I don't know whether I should feel happy<br/>about this or jealous.)")
('Van', "Nope. I ain't promising jack—not even for the kids.")
('Van', "But...I guess I'll keep all that in mind.")
('System', 'Once the group finished eating the samples, Van and<br/>Agnès resumed their patrol.')
('System', 'Quest For the Kids completed!')
('System', 'Received')
(500, 'Fourth District, Tyrell')
('Feri', "Wow! It's so busy here!")
('Feri', "It's amazing everything's under control with so<br/>many people. It feels so different from Station Street!")
('Van', "That's Tyrell for you.")
('Van', "As you might've guessed, this is where the Tyrell<br/>Times was founded. There're a handful of other<br/>publishers HQ'd here, too.")
('Van', "As a result, tons of young people like to hang<br/>out here. It's where you'll first find a lot of trends and<br/>subcultures takin' off.")
('Agnès', "This area has a fairly distinct vibe you won't find<br/>anywhere else in the city as a result, yes.")
('Agnès', "I've come here a handful of times with my friends<br/>from school. One of them even works at the<br/>bookstore here.")
('Van', 'Plenty more to find here than just books, too. I find<br/>myself out here all the time.')
('Van', "Why don't we wander around here a little while?<br/>Nothin' beats seeing a place firsthand when you<br/>wanna get to know it.")
('Feri', "Okay! Let's go!")
('Van', "Gonna watch a movie? I'll tag along if you want.")
('Van', "Not that I'm the first choice for company for a<br/>ladykiller like you.")
('Dingo', 'Oh, hey, Van. No, I just found myself passing by<br/>while thinking about some things.')
('Dingo', 'This film festival coming up in Tharbad is shaping up<br/>to be a messy one.')
('Van', "You're tellin' me. As if there wasn't enough attention<br/>on it after Messeldam's got canned, we've got those<br/>threatening notes to deal with.")
('Van', "You just had to give us a tough job, didn't you?")
('Dingo', "Heh. So what if it is? I knew you could handle it, so<br/>that's why I referred you.")
('Dingo', "It shouldn't all be so bad out there. I promise to hook<br/>you guys up with some decent 4SPGs for your trouble<br/>while you're there.")
('Van', "Thanks. I'd appreciate it.")
('Van', "I'm just impressed you know such a famous actress.<br/>I guess that comes with being such a hot-shot<br/>reporter, but still. How'd you two even meet?")
('Dingo', "Nina and I happen to share a minor connection,<br/>that's all. I wouldn't say we're all that friendly or<br/>anything along those lines.")
('Dingo', "She is quite an impressive person, though. I'll grant<br/>you that.")
('Van', "Hell yeah, she is. Already on top of the movie world<br/>at her age. With those looks and the acting chops to<br/>back 'em up, she more than belongs.")
('Dingo', "I'm not talking about any of that. I'm more talking<br/>about her personality.")
('Dingo', "She's an incredibly tenacious young woman with an<br/>equally strong will—more than people give her<br/>credit for. I'm sure you've noticed, too, right?")
('Van', '...Yeah. Guess you could say I have.')
('Van', "I'm sure a lot of that has to do with her whole<br/>background and how—")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "There you are, Dingo! I've been looking all over<br/>for you!")
('Dingo', '*sigh* Hey, Marielle. What is it this time?')
('Van', "Man, she really can't get enough of you, can she?")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "You're that spriggan! What are you doing hanging<br/>out with Dingo again?")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'W-Wait. A-Are you two, like...a thing?!')
('Van', 'Does it LOOK like it? Some reporter you are.')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "And what's that supposed to mean?! I just don't think<br/>you're a good enough man for Dingo, that's all!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'As for you, mister, fess up! What have you been<br/>pursuing all this time, huh?')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', 'What could possibly be so big that it has so much of<br/>your attention?!')
('Dingo', "I told you before, it doesn't concern you.")
('Dingo', "Besides, why should I feel obligated to tell someone<br/>from a competitor what I'm working on?")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "You sure didn't seem to be having any trouble talking<br/>to him before I showed up!")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Why can you tell him but not me? That's not fair!<br/>That's not fair at all!")
('Van', '(Ugh. For the love of Aidios, keep me outta this!)')
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Wait a minute. If you're here in the theater, could it<br/>have something to do with the movie festival?")
('Dingo', 'Err...')
('Van', 'Say, Dingo. Did you mention there was a movie you<br/>wanted to see?')
('Van', "Wish I could take you up on your invitation, but<br/>somethin' came up, so I gotta bail.")
('Van', "Real sorry, man. I know it's not exactly the funnest<br/>thing, watchin' a movie by yourself. But I bet it'll still<br/>be good without me.")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "Oh, you're here to see something?")
('Marielle (Clothes Half-Disintegrated/No Slime)', "I'll join you! I'm completely free right now, so I'd be<br/>more than happy to spend some time with<br/>you, Dingo!")
('Dingo', '(Damn it, Van! What the hell did you have to do<br/>that for?)')
('Van', "(Oh, quit whining. She's a sweetheart when you get<br/>down to it. Be a good mentor and show her a<br/>nice time.)")
('Van', "Have fun, you two! I'll see you both later.")
('Agnès', 'Oh, it looks like the movie theater changed<br/>its banners.')
('Feri', "Hey, you're right. They were for Golden Blood<br/>before, but now they're showing Wolves' Requiem.")
('Aaron', "Guess so. They used to be for Golden Blood, but now<br/>it looks like they're advertising Wolves' Requiem.")
('Risette', 'Could that be as a result of the awards at the Tharbad<br/>Film Festival?')
('Van', "That's what I'd put my money on. It's been like that<br/>with other film festivals, too.")
('Van', 'Whatever movie takes the top prize always sees a big<br/>jump in moviegoers.')
('Van', 'Plus for as popular as Golden Blood has been, its<br/>box-office earnings were starting to taper off anyway.')
('Van', "So it makes sense they'd switch out the banners now<br/>to promote the latest hot thing.")
('Agnès', "That's true. I've been seeing all kinds of things<br/>leaning in that direction lately, not just<br/>movie theaters.")
('Agnès', 'It feels like every magazine lately is publishing<br/>interviews and specials about Nina.')
('Agnès', 'At this point, she must be getting as much media<br/>exposure as Judith.')
('Van', "Part of that's probably her agency striking while the<br/>iron's hot and getting her out there, you gotta figure.")
('Van', "Especially while Judith's got tabloids like Buzzraider<br/>going to town on her, writin' pretty much whatever<br/>they please.")
('Risette', "'Whatever' indeed. I saw a headline recently that<br/>claimed she was brooding after she lost the award for<br/>Best Actress to Nina.")
('Feri', "Really? I don't think she'd be like that, if you ask me.")
('Aaron', "As if she's the type of chick to stay in down in the<br/>dumps over something like that.")
('Agnès', 'Exactly. If anything, I imagine it would light a fire in<br/>her to work even harder.')
('Van', "Hell, I've seen those rags claim she's even got herself<br/>a boyfriend these days.")
('Feri', 'What? She does?!')
('Agnès', 'Huh? Is that true?!')
('Van', "These're tabloids we're talkin' about here. What do<br/>you think?")
('Van', "Doesn't matter if what they publish is real or<br/>total bullshit. Long as it makes them money, that's<br/>what counts.")
('Van', "So don't go takin' 'em at their word. Though I gotta<br/>say, a certain someone seems awful invested in the<br/>woman's love life.")
('Agnès', "I-I'm not sure 'invested' is the right word for it. It's<br/>just a little surprising to hear that out of nowhere.<br/>But you're right. It's good to be cautious with those.")
(40301, "Hey, did you read this month's Buzzraider?")
(40302, "I haven't yet, but my friend told me what they wrote<br/>about Judith Lanster!")
(40301, 'At first I was shocked by it. But the more I think<br/>about it, maybe it makes sense. You know what<br/>I mean?')
(40302, 'Yeah, totally! I hear you!')
('Quatre', 'Judith Lanster sure is famous, getting people to talk<br/>about her as much as they do.')
('Quatre', "I feel like I've been hearing her name come up an<br/>awful lot the past couple of days.")
('Agnès', 'I know. I wonder if something happened to her?')
('Van', 'What? Feeling a little concerned for her?')
('Agnès', "I suppose so. It's hard not to worry when people are<br/>speculating about her so much.")
('Quatre', 'Are you a fan of hers, Agnès?')
('Agnès', "I am, but that's not the only reason I'm concerned in<br/>this instance.")
('Feri', "I do kinda wonder what's up... Buzzraider was the<br/>name of the magazine they were talking about, was it?")
('Aaron', "Buzzraider's what that magazine's called, yeah?<br/>The one those two were talking about? Not that I<br/>care one way or the other.")
('Risette', "Those two were discussing the contents of<br/>Buzzraider, yes? I've seen that magazine on<br/>newsstands from time to time.")
('Van', "Yeah. It's somethin' of a rival to Meld, the place that<br/>Dingo works for.")
('Van', "Buzzraider's got more of a dicier rep by comparison.<br/>Gotta take their stories with a couple grains of salt<br/>and then some.")
('Van', "But it's always possible those guys managed to<br/>actually dig up some sorta scoop about Judith—for<br/>better or worse.")
('Van', 'If you guys are that curious, we can always buy a copy<br/>at the bookstore. You can consider it another way to<br/>gather intel.')
('Quatre', 'You rely on even tabloids to gather your information?<br/>Is that really such a good idea?')
('Van', "Don't get me wrong. About ninety percent of what<br/>they publish is bullshit—but it ain't smart to write off<br/>rags like that altogether, either.")
('Agnès', 'I just want to know if something happened to her, at<br/>the very least. Hopefully Buzzraider can explain what.')
('Van', "Then let's go ahead and swing by the bookstore later<br/>to pick up a copy. Doesn't hurt to check it out.")
('System', 'Once the party bought their copy of Buzzraider, they<br/>proceeded to page through its contents outside of<br/>the bookstore.')
('Van', "Hmm... 'Judith Lanster and Maxim the Red Comet<br/>Madly in Love,' it says.")
('Agnès', 'What? THOSE two?!')
('Quatre', "Maxim, as in Maxim Lugan? He's the Z1<br/>champion, yes?")
('Quatre', 'I do recall both of them being single, but is it really<br/>worth people getting so worked up about it?')
('Van', "We're talkin' about two big celebrities possibly<br/>getting together here. That's reason enough to work<br/>people into a frenzy.")
('Van', "But I think it's safe to say it's what's actually in the<br/>article that's got people talking.")
('Quatre', "'Maxim Lugan has lovers in countless places.'")
('Quatre', "'Word on the street is that he pays visits to these<br/>women while taking his road trips.'")
('Quatre', "'We at Buzzraider believe that Judith Lanster is one<br/>such mistress of his, tricked into becoming one after<br/>being fed lies by the racecar driver.'")
('Quatre', 'Okay, now I see what all the fuss is about.')
('Feri', "Hey, guys? What's a 'mistress'?")
('Agnès', "Er, that's...nothing you should worry about, Feri.")
('Feri', 'Uhh, all right...?')
('Aaron', "I don't buy it. You think an actress that's as hot of a<br/>ticket as her is really gonna be wooed by a prick<br/>like him?")
('Risette', 'The source for this article seems rather unreliable.')
('Van', "Agreed. It's hard to take this article seriously with<br/>material like this.")
('Van', "All they've got to back their claims up is a<br/>single photo. The rest of it could absolutely be totally<br/>made up bullshit.")
('Van', 'Which, to be fair, is pretty par for the course for<br/>magazines like that, so no surprise there.')
('Quatre', "That's good to know. I can't say I'm otherwise in the<br/>habit of reading these sorts of publications often.")
('Van', 'In any case, whether those two have gotten together<br/>or not is their business.')
('Van', "It's not our place to comment on.")
('Agnès', "Yeah. I suppose you're right...")
('Van', "(But if you ask me, I can't see someone like Grimcat<br/>hookin' up with the likes of him.)")
('Van', "(Though I wouldn't put it past her to have a whole<br/>harem of hot items hangin' around her.)")
('Van', "(Sure would be nice if fancy cars really brought that<br/>sort of attention to a guy, I'll say that much.)")
('Agnès', "Van? What's the matter?")
('Van', "Sorry. Got lost in my own thoughts for a sec.<br/>Let's get movin'.")
('Detective Nate', "Come on! You need to get inside the theater! It's too<br/>dangerous outside!")
(40301, 'Aaah!')
(40301, '*sniffle* Mommy...')
('Detective Nate', "Get in the movie theater! Hurry! I'll handle<br/>things here!")
(40301, 'O-Okay!')
('Detective Nate', "This is as far as you go! You won't get past me! If you<br/>think you can push the Edith police around, you'll<br/>be sorry!")
('Detective Nate', "Eeek! I'm sorry! I'm SORRYYY!")
('Van', "Don't sweat it, Detective. You did good holding out.")
('Detective Nate', 'What? Is that you, Van?!')
('Aaron', 'Guess you do know how to do your job after all.<br/>Pretty cute watching you quake in your boots so<br/>much, though.')
('Feri', "Don't worry! We'll take it from here!")
('Risette', 'If you would, keep the citizens safe in the meantime!')
('Detective Nate', 'Right, of course! Counting on you guys!')
('Van', 'All right, gang. Time to clean house!')
('Detective Nate', 'Is it... Is it over?')
('Feri', 'Yep! Enemy eliminated!')
('Risette', 'I can confirm that there are no hostile elements<br/>within the vicinity.')
('Detective Nate', '*sigh* I owe you big time. How did you guys manage<br/>to take such nasty things down?')
('Detective Nate', 'They gave us cops a hard time and that was even with<br/>all of our gear.')
('Van', "What can I say? When you're a spriggan, you just get<br/>the job done—otherwise you'll be out on your ass fast.")
('Detective Nate', 'I always thought you were some lowlife out to<br/>trick people. But maybe I was—')
('Detective Nate', "What am I saying? You can't fool me! You must be<br/>pulling something here! How can you have such a<br/>perfect response to a crisis like this, huh?!")
('Van', "Don't you have better things to do with your time<br/>right now than yelling at me, Detective? Like maybe<br/>keepin' those civilians safe?")
('Detective Nate', "Shut up! I don't need you telling me how to do my<br/>job, spriggan!")
('Detective Nate', "Ugh... Anyway, I don't know what you guys are<br/>planning to do, but...but...")
('Detective Nate', 'Stay safe out there, all right?!')
('Van', 'Will do. You, too, pal.')
('Van', "Grabbing a bite to eat, you two? Looks like you're<br/>livin' large if you're havin' a full course.")
('Jack', 'You could call it compensation for some work we did.<br/>I know the woman who runs this place. She and I go<br/>way back.')
('Halle', "For someone in Heiyue's upper management, Mau's a<br/>surprisingly understanding person.")
('Halle', "That said, it is a LITTLE concerning just how much<br/>Jack gets wasted when he's here.")
('Jack', "L-Lay off me! You don't expect a man's pride to take<br/>a hit when he's on a losing streak or what?!")
('Halle', 'Lay off you? Is that what you have to say to me after I<br/>stepped in and bargained on your behalf?')
('Halle', "Look, if you're gonna make bets, you need to set your<br/>sights on more sensible stuff or else you always end up<br/>feeling miserable.")
('Jack', 'Sensible, huh? What do you mean by that?')
('Halle', "All right, I'll give you an example.")
('Halle', "Let's say you pick two cards from my hand<br/>of five. If the sum of yours beats mine,<br/>you win.")
('Halle', "And if you win, you can go out and enjoy the<br/>Entertainment District. I'll even give you cash to have<br/>some fun.")
('Jack', "You're on! I'm going to hold you to what you just<br/>said, all right? No takebacks!")
('Van', 'The cards might be stacked against him, but he stands<br/>to gain a lot if he wins.')
('Van', 'Guess a lot of it ultimately comes down to<br/>mind games.')
('Jack', "I think I'll go for this... No, the left edge looks<br/>real suspicious.")
('Halle', "Whoa, whoa, whoa! What do you think you're doing?")
('Jack', "Gah, guess I'm barking up the wrong tree.<br/>(But knowing her, she'll be two steps ahead of me, so<br/>I just gotta be three!)")
('Halle', "(Heh! You're not gonna win that easily!)")
('Van', "Yeesh. Those two sure didn't take long to get all<br/>fired up.")
('Agnès', "Even during the Revolution Festival, they're<br/>still gambling. I guess I shouldn't be all<br/>that shocked...")
('Feri', "Even on the Revolution Festival, those two are<br/>still gambling. That's so like those two!")
('Aaron', 'Nice. If Jack wins, us guys will have to tag along on<br/>his big night out.')
('Risette', "I'm glad to see the two of them are<br/>enjoying themselves. That's what matters most on a<br/>day like today.")
('Quatre', 'Those two are from Langport, right? They really do<br/>seem to love their gambling.')
('Judith', "(Oh, yeah. There's a gambling movie being shopped<br/>around, isn't there?)")
('Judith', "(I'd better pay close attention to those two so when I<br/>get my offer to star in it, I'll be ready!)")
('Bergard', 'I am glad to see it all worked out amicably in the end.')
('Detective Nate', "Man, Revolution Festival's the best day of the year!<br/>Don't you agree, babe? Sure, the festival can be a real<br/>pain in the neck, but I still love today!")
("Nate's Girlfriend", '...')
('Detective Nate', "With that whole speech over, I don't have to think<br/>about work anymore. We can have fun together all<br/>day long, like Aidios intended!")
("Nate's Girlfriend", '...')
('Detective Nate', "Oh, I also bought us some tickets for Golden Blood<br/>Director's Cut! Can't go wrong with that!")
("Nate's Girlfriend", '...')
('Detective Nate', 'Uh... Babe? Are you...mad about something?')
("Nate's Girlfriend", '*sigh* Nate...I think we should break up.')
('Detective Nate', 'Huh?! Wh-Wh-What?! WHY?! How can you<br/>say that?!')
("Nate's Girlfriend", "Why do you think? After everything that happened, I<br/>haven't heard from you in a whole month.")
("Nate's Girlfriend", 'Do you really expect me to be happy after being<br/>treated like that just because you decided to suddenly<br/>drag me out there?')
('Detective Nate', "B-Babe! I didn't mean to ignore you! I've just been<br/>swamped with work, that's all!")
("Nate's Girlfriend", 'Uh-huh. What about that policewoman you were<br/>talking to earlier? You sure seemed to be enjoying her<br/>company JUST FINE.')
('Detective Nate', "Wait! I can explain! There's a perfectly reasonable<br/>explanation for that!")
('Agnès', "(Erm, not to sound mean, I can't say I feel too sorry<br/>for him.)")
('Feri', "(Is this what it means to be 'in the doghouse'?)")
('Aaron', '(Sucks to be him! Gehenna hath no fury like a<br/>woman scorned!)')
('Risette', "(Heehee. I suppose now isn't a good time to talk<br/>to him.)")
('Quatre', "(Hmm... I don't really know what's going on between<br/>the two of them, but it seems to me like he probably<br/>brought it on himself.)")
('Judith', "(I remember her. He dragged her to the Tharbad<br/>Film Festival, too. I'm impressed she's put up with<br/>him for as long as she has.)")
('Bergard', "(Haha. It isn't easy to be young.)")
('Van', '(Yeah, I think we should just leave those two alone<br/>and move on for now.)')
('Agnès', 'Oh! Hello there. Good to see you!')
('Renne', "Long time, no see. I guess it's been about three days?")
('Renne', 'From what I gather, it seems like you and Agnès here<br/>have already gone around the festival. Is that right?')
('Agnès', "I told you, we all traded off! It wasn't just him and me<br/>the entire time.")
('Albert', '(Grr...!)')
('Odette', "(See? That's exactly what we heard!)")
('Renne', "I take it you're working as a two-man team as you<br/>make your way around the festival?")
('Odette', 'Nice to see you!')
('Albert', "Hmph. Glad to see you're doing something<br/>worthwhile, I guess.")
('Van', "We're just helpin' out how we can. You guys out on<br/>your own patrol as Student Council or somethin'?")
('Agnès', "Yeah. There are a lot of Aramis students around town<br/>today, so it's important for us to also be around.")
('Renne', "We are. We have a lot of Aramis students around<br/>town today, so it's important for us to be out as well.")
('Renne', "Got to make sure nobody's having TOO much fun<br/>and causing any trouble out there, after all.")
('Renne', "Not that I need to explain it to you, of all people.<br/>I'm sure you were in my shoes back in the day. ❤")
('Van', 'Pretty much, yeah.')
('Albert', "Oh, right. I forgot you were on Student Council eight<br/>years ago. Could've fooled me.")
('Odette', 'Yep! He and the others gave us some big shoes to fill.')
('Odette', "Anyway, we're all just taking a short break after<br/>breaking off to do our whole patrol.")
('Odette', 'Did you happen to see the 4SPG I left you?')
('Van', "Sure did. Never thought I'd answer a call from you.")
('Van', "Seein' as you're all together, I think I can guess what<br/>you guys want from me.")
('Odette', "Hmm... Hey, Van, you haven't read my post<br/>yet, have you?")
('Agnès', "Oh, that's right...")
('Albert', 'Hmph.')
('Van', "(Heh. Are you telling me this guy's...?)")
('Renne', "(Maybe. He might act standoffish, but he's got good<br/>potential in him. Trust me.)")
('Renne', "Well, we're holding things down just fine, so feel free<br/>to take your time checking things out and come back<br/>later, Agnès.")
('Odette', "Yeah! Days like this don't come around often!<br/>Better make the most of this quality time with your<br/>boss and enjoy the festival together! ❤")
('Agnès', "Augh, you two...! I promise I'll be back later, okay?")
('Albert', "I-I trust you! I know you're...you're only going out<br/>with him for work! It's okay!")
('Van', "(*sigh* Kid's got negative chill, I swear.)")
('Agnès', "I'm at a good stopping point right now, so whenever<br/>you need me, feel free to come fetch me.")
('Agnès', "Just say the word and I'll be happy to join.")
('Van', 'Sounds good to me. Thanks, Agnès.')
('Feri', 'In the meantime, you should relax! Enjoy<br/>yourself, okay?')
('Aaron', 'Until then, just sit tight and chat or whatever.')
('Risette', 'In the meantime, please, feel free to relax,<br/>Ms. Claudel. I insist.')
('Quatre', "Until then, feel free to relax. We've got this<br/>under control.")
('Judith', 'In the meantime, I want to see you doing nothing<br/>but relaxing. Got it?')
('Bergard', 'Until then, feel free to enjoy yourself. You have<br/>earned it.')
('Ashen', "Everyone! I'm so glad to see you! Are you<br/>okay, Agnès?!")
('Agnès', "I'm so sorry, Ashen. You must've been so worried...")
('Van', "I'm just glad to see you're doing okay and back with<br/>your family. Now I can breathe easier.")
('Aaron', 'Looks like you guys have rounded up everyone in the<br/>organization you can put to work.')
('Cao', "Indeed. We don't have that many people to offer, but<br/>you can be sure that I'll put them to good use...")
('Cao', '...especially now that most members of a certain<br/>family have ceased operating given the<br/>current situation.')
('Feri', 'Wait? Are you talking about...?')
('Bergard', 'You must mean the faction who sent their goons out<br/>to Oración in secret.')
('Fan', "Correct. They might belong to the same<br/>organization, but lately, we haven't seen eye to eye<br/>with them very much.")
('Fan', "But all of that pales in comparison to what's<br/>happening right now. We deeply appreciate your<br/>assistance in this matter, Ms. Mau.")
('Owner Mau', "Think nothing of it. I'll do my utmost to<br/>help however I can.")
('Van', "(Remind me. That chick doesn't run with the<br/>Lus, right? She's with a different family?)")
('Aaron', "(Right. They're more a neutral family in pretty decent<br/>standing with the Lus.)")
('Aaron', "(It's the other family that's a big concern. But if<br/>they're in no position to act, then we can probably<br/>ignore them for now.)")
('Fan', '...Heiyue will offer whatever support it can in this<br/>operation, albeit in an indirect capacity.')
('Fan', 'At this stage, our efforts in the southern part of the<br/>city to evacuate those who can flee are<br/>nearing completion.')
('Fan', "However, when it comes to the technological side of<br/>dealing with the anomaly, that, unfortunately, is not<br/>our organization's forte.")
('Ashen', "Don't worry! That doesn't mean we plan to hang you<br/>guys out to dry and leave you to fend completely<br/>for yourselves!")
('Ashen', "If you guys need anything, just ask! We'll absolutely<br/>do whatever we can to back you guys up!")
('Agnès', 'Ashen, Fan...')
('Judith', "I'm not exactly the biggest fan of calling in favors<br/>with you guys, but in a time like this, your help is<br/>definitely appreciated.")
('Cao', 'Be that as it may, keep in mind that we also have Yin<br/>on our side as well. She may be able to lend you all<br/>her aid more directly.')
('Cao', "If you find yourself a little short on help, as it were,<br/>please, don't hesitate to ask. In fact, we may even loan<br/>her out to you regardless.")
('Van', "Great. Just what I need, a guy like you lookin' for<br/>excuses to have us owe you one. I appreciate it.")
('Ashen', 'I hear you. Favors like that can have a way<br/>of snowballing.')
('Aaron', "Forget it, man. He's gonna do what he's gonna do.<br/>I wouldn't fight it.")
('Fan', "*sigh* Don't go overboard, Cao.")
('System', 'Break the Demon Stone?')
('System', 'Break the Demon Stone?')
('System', 'Break the Demon Stone?')
('Van', "(Can never go wrong with a nighttime trip to<br/>the movies. What've we got playing tonight?)")
('Van', '(Sober Curious starring Nike Marceau...)')
('Van', "(Oh, yeah. I think that woman's got a lot of history<br/>with a certain gambler I know.)")
('Van', "(They're also playing This Side of Heaven.<br/>Wouldn't mind seein' that.)")
('Van', '(Which one should I check out?)')
('Van', '(Or should I just forget about it and move on?)')
('System', "It's a monument depicting a group of four animals.")
('System', 'Exit the movie theater?')
