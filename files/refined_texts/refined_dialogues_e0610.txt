('Albert', 'Wait!')
('Agnès', 'Albert, Odette!')
('Agnès', 'What are you two doing here?')
('Albert', 'Renne texted us. She said the two of you will be<br/>absent for the next three days.')
('Albert', 'As soon as I got her message, I woke up Odette, and<br/>we called a cab and got here as fast as possible.')
('Odette', "Most trains aren't running at this hour, so that was<br/>really our only option.")
('Albert', 'Now, then. Where exactly are you going this<br/>early, hmm? Off on another thrilling adventure with<br/>that scoundrel and his shady entourage?')
('Albert', "If you keep throwing yourself into danger, one day<br/>you'll wind up getting hurt—or worse.")
('Agnès', 'I...')
('Agnès', "I'm sorry for worrying you both. I should have told<br/>you sooner.")
('Agnès', "I can't promise it won't be dangerous, but I have to do<br/>th—")
('Odette', "No! You don't HAVE to do anything!")
('Odette', "I don't want to lose you! I mean, look at what<br/>happened to Creil!")
('Odette', 'I know you put a lot of pressure on yourself because<br/>of your family...')
('Odette', "...but if that's your only reason—if you're just<br/>risking your life for your dad's sake, then—<br/>then I won't let you go!")
('Agnès', 'Odette...')
('Feri', 'Agnès...')
('Van', '...')
('Agnès', "I'll admit that I'm doing this in part because of Dad...")
('Agnès', "...but that's not my only reason.")
('Agnès', "Ever since I started this job, I've been exposed to<br/>people of all walks of life, I've accumulated a wealth<br/>of important life experiences...")
('Agnès', "...and I've felt closer to my mother and grandmother<br/>than ever before through the things they left behind.")
('Agnès', "It's all become just as vital to my growth as our<br/>day-to-day lessons at Aramis.")
('Agnès', "I'd even go as far as to say it's become an inseparable<br/>part of who I am.")
('Agnès', "So please, don't try and stop me.")
('Agnès', "I'm not just going because of my family—or because<br/>of what they passed down to me.")
('Agnès', "I'm going because this is something that I have to do<br/>for myself.")
('Odette', '...')
('Albert', 'Agnès...')
('Agnès', 'Ah!')
('Feri', 'Whose car is that?')
('Kincaid', "You're certainly up bright and early. About to depart,<br/>I take it?")
('Van', 'René.')
('Aaron', "The hell's he doing here?")
('Quatre', 'Wha...?')
('Risette', '...')
('Judith', 'What? Him?!')
('Feri', "(That's the guy who's always on the city screens.)")
('Agnès', 'Dad...')
('President Gramheart', 'One must always be responsible when making critical<br/>decisions—and be acutely aware of their<br/>potential repercussions.')
('President Gramheart', 'I pray you took that into careful consideration when<br/>making yours, Agnès.')
('Agnès', "Of course I did. I am my father's daughter, after all.")
('Agnès', 'I fully intend to seize every opportunity to broaden<br/>my horizons and learn from my collective experiences.')
('Agnès', "As much as it pains me to admit, I can't promise that<br/>I'll return safe and sound...")
('Agnès', "...but I can promise that I'll spare no effort to do so.<br/>The last thing I want is to sadden you and the friends<br/>I love so dearly.")
('Albert', 'Agnès...')
('Odette', '...')
('President Gramheart', 'Heh.')
('President Gramheart', "Very well. Make the most of your connections while<br/>you're away. The CID is at your beck and call.")
('President Gramheart', 'There are many truths that lie dormant in the gap<br/>between ideals and reality. You would do well to seek<br/>them out.')
('Agnès', '...')
('President Gramheart', 'I will cover for you with regards to your absence<br/>from Aramis.')
('President Gramheart', 'You have three days. No more, no less. If you exceed<br/>that, I will send in the army.')
('President Gramheart', "That is as far as I'm willing to compromise.")
('Agnès', "That's more than enough. Thank you, Dad.")
('President Gramheart', 'I entrust my daughter into your care, Arkride.')
('President Gramheart', 'You would do well to utilize her services to the fullest.')
('President Gramheart', "I see you've gathered a retinue of assistants<br/>and associates. I am depending on you all to keep her<br/>safe from harm.")
('Van', "No need to worry, Mr. Prez. Your girl's in<br/>good hands.")
('Van', "We may skirt the rules of society from time to time,<br/>but we ain't about to break any labor laws.")
('Bergard', 'I, too, will do all I can to ensure the safety of<br/>everyone here.')
('President Gramheart', 'Heheh. You have my thanks.')
('Kincaid', 'I will give you a call once you reach the city.')
('Kincaid', 'I shall leave a certain other woman in your capable<br/>hands as well.')
('Van', '*sigh* Always finds a way to saddle me<br/>with busywork.')
('Van', "Anyway, that president is sure somethin'.<br/>Definitely has the looks for the part...")
('Van', "...but he sure doesn't wear his heart on his sleeve.<br/>The guy clearly cares about you, but he just won't<br/>come out and say it.")
('Agnès', '...')
('Agnès', "Heehee. Well, he is a politician at heart.<br/>Evading direct answers is what they're good at.")
('Odette', "Darn it! I had so many arguments prepared, but now<br/>they've been blown out of the water!")
('Odette', 'Just come back to me safely, all right?')
('Agnès', 'Will do!')
('Albert', "If anything does happen, just give us a ring, and we'll<br/>be there before you know it.")
('Albert', 'Until then...please look after our friend.')
('Feri', 'Of course!')
('Van', 'Yeah—you got it.')
